a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z favorite teams are san diego padres and the oakland a's and i like baseball because there's you have to be fast you have to think use your head outwit the other players and that's about it and what else i play shortstop second base center field right field left field and sometimes pitcher focusing on the ball and the speed of the ball and sometimes the pitchers they like what's that called no it's like when they're like either big and they like yeah intimidating that the hardest thing and if you think you can't hit the ball then you're not going to hit it

 a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z football and wrestling well actually it doesn't make any difference i just start losing weight toward the end of football seasons actually a typical week is pretty easy the only thing that's really hard are daily doubles we're actually our daily doubles are different because we have to go in about two hours spurts you wake up about seven in the morning get there about seven thirty eight o'clock you work for two hours go inside and take a break you go outside and work for another two hours and then come back inside and maybe eat lunch then go back out for the last two hours football well practice is just well usually we do our warmups and then we go to offense and defense and then we're into like offensive techniques and defensive techniques and we go and do like offensive team work and then we have defensive team work and then sometimes we'll scriage at the end and then that's over d our coaches do sometimes certain things maybe we will work towards defenses and offenses compared to theirs because sometimes they have three people in the front line or sometimes they have four four people in the front line defense tch i don't know because you get to go after the guy with the ball 
a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z football is a very athletic sport and i usually play wide receiver all for safety ohh wide receiver you have to run your on your little play rights or it could screw up everything something like that i listen to rap like snoop and like like the old school rap like k c and okay it's shawshank redemption it's a movie it's one of my favorite movies it's just about tim robbins he's he's not guilty for this murder but he's tried for it and he's found guilty because he all the evidence goes against him and then and so this other guy tries to get him out because he got sent to the jail shawshank and so everybody tries to get him out because they a actually believe him that he's not guilty and stuff

 a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z yeah like how i don't know and how you play it okay well basketball's little a big ball an orange ball and you dribble it with your hands and you shoot it into a basket and there is ten people on the floor at a time and you play it indoors usually and there is five people on the team but there is usually more people to a team but there is five people on the team out on the floor at the same time i don't know to start the game there is like a jump ball and they send the ball in the area and the two tallest people usually tip the ball and you have plays and there is different positions that are played there is a point guard who drills the ball the most and brings the ball to court and then there is wings which are like on both sides of the court and then there is posts that are down by the basket to rebound the ball is that all i don't know what else to say 
 a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z yeah the object of the game you have nine people out on the field and you try to get the person out by throwing it to first base and then we you have to have three outs in order to go and bat and everybody gets a chance so yeah me and my family we go camping a lot so we're going camping this suer and we're going to california for a family reunion eureka and so that'll be fun and i've never been there really i've <unk> past it when i went was i when when i was in volleyball we went down to sacramento and had a tournament so i only drove by it but i didn't really there's this place it's by it's down by the coast it's called barview and another one is to is spruce run and there's one called crater lake but you actually camp at diamond lake so it's a nice place there's lots of things to do yeah yeah we went up there twice it's it's really it's really pretty it was once a volcano and it blew and so it's made a crater and it's a big old huge lake that's why they call it crater lake and in the middle there's an island it's called wizard island it was what's left it was what was left of the mountain when it blew so and you can go down in there ride the boat you turn around yeah that was fun

 right now a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y and z i like baseball it it is fun when i play it i hit homeruns i like baseball because you you get to get people out that's all baseball is easy what you do is you you if there is a fly ball and you're running on the base you you go halfway and if they catch it you are out and if they drop it you you you are not out you just keep running if you do an overthrow you only can go one base if you were playing out in the outfield you must pay attention so the ball won't hit you in the head 
right now a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z go one time when i was playing on the swings i fell and i landed on my feet but first my brother started following me and tripped over me and then my dog came and licked my head to see if i was ok i can't think of anything my bird's name is star and it has it's green blue and it's a girl i i don't have it in a cage i leave the door open so that it can go on top of the cage and because i had a lady at work that my dad works with train her so sthat he can go on her fingers and and stuff

 right now a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z tennessee walkers are my favorite horses because they're really smooth in riding them and they're really gentle and they're really different from all the other horses because they only have three gaits and gaits are when y the what they walk like or how they move and they only have a walk they have a running walk and then they have a canter unlike other horses who have four which is a walk a a trot a canter and a gallop and i like to ride western because that's the only way i know how to and i also ride bareback with bareback pads and i ride with nothing and i go up in the suertime and i ride with my aunt and we ride all over the desert up in washington and the tricities and i like to go to all different places and ride horses for a long time and i could do whenever i can and hopefully when i turn about eighteen i'll be able to get my own horse and so i have to wait until i can get enough money and so i'll have to pay for my own because my parents won't pay for it and i'll have to pay for its food and all of its hay and grain and all the stuff it's supposed to eat and then the saddle and then the bridle and then the the hoof picks and then get the vet to come in and then keep talking

sure okay and when do i start ohh right a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z i usually do my homework play my instrument and then if i have any free time do something with a friend played in fourth grade and then i skipped fifth grade because i would have had to miss classes to do it that was kinda dumb so then i did i'm doing it this year again so two years sort of but kind of three years grand and my mom used to play a little bit so she teaches she teaches me a little lots of songs basically now the sheet music is russian sailors dance in dayton dance lots of dance things let me see <unk> stuff like that just lots of songs sometimes we get time to shoot around the the gym yeah no i like to play right now i'm doing soccer and track but i won't start tr soccer until fall so basically only track
