now a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z in baseball if one team gets three outs it's the other team's turn to go up and bat there are only allowed nine players on the field three on the outfield and the other six in the infield you can only get three strikes while you're up to bat and four balls if you get hit while hit by the pitch while you're batting you can take a base and if there's a pop fly in the infield the smart thing to do is if there is runners on the base the smart thing to do is let the ball drop and tag the runners out and that's about it my favorite baseball team is mariners because they're the closest team to home m not really i plan on probably sleeping in and going out and doing stuff with my friends take a vacation somewhere yeah he's about five three wears glasses short hair and pretty smart
