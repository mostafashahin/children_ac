I FORGET WHAT THEY'RE CALLED UHM
AND I GUESS THAT MMM
AND I DON'T UHM
AND SO HE FIGURED OUT THAT MAGNETS DON'T WORK ON APPLES OR PENNIES AND THEY DO WORK ON TACKS AND PAPER CLIPS
I ASKED MY MOM AND DAD FOR A BROTHER OR SISTER I WANT SOMEONE TO PLAY WITH
I TOLD THEM JUST
BROUGHT
S
HOME
FOR A THE HOSPITAL
HE JUST
HE WAS JUST
A BABY HE COULDN'T DO ANYTHING
CAN WE TRADE HIM IN I ASKED FOR
OF COURSE WE CAN'T TRADE HIM
IN HE
IS YOUR BROTHER THEY SAID
HOW
L
LOUIS
IS SIX MONTHS OLD
HE CAN'T DO MUCH HE'S NOT MUCH FUN M MY CAT
HAD KITTENS
THE
KITTENS
CAN RUN
JUMP AND CLIMB THEY ARE LOTS OF FUN
THEY ARE ONLY THREE MONTHS OLD
THEY ARE YOUNGER THAN LOUIS
ALL LOUIS DOES IS SLEEP
WELL SOMETIMES HE
CRIES AND EATS A LOT TOO HOW LONG DOES IT MAKE A BABY TO GROW ASKED THE KITTENS ARE YOU YOUNGER THAN LOUIS THEY CAN DO MANY THINGS LOUIS HAS A PROBLEM
HE CAN'T DO ANYTHING LOOK AT YOUR KITTENS MOM SAID
THEY ARE
ALMOST AS BIG AS THEIR MOTHER
BUT PEOPLE TAKE LONGER TO GROW THAN KITTENS
DO YOU S S DO SOON
LOUIS WILL BE ABLE TO DO THINGS SOON HE WILL
BE MORE FUN
MOM TOOK SOME PICTURES
FROM A BOX THEY WERE
BABY PICTURES
THE BABY PICTURES MOM SAID ONCE YOU WERE AS SMALL AS LOUIS SEE HOW MUCH YOU GAVE
HAVE
GROWN IN SIX YEARS
THEN LUIS STARTED TO CRY
LUNCH TIME SAID MOM
YOU AND LOUIS NEED A LOT
OF GOOD FOOD
DO YOU
ALL
THAT GROWING
THAT GAVE
ME AN IDEA
MAYBE LOUIS WASN'T GROWING FAST BECAUSE HE DIDN'T EAT
THE RIGHT FOOD KITTENS EAT FOOD
THEY GROW VERY FAST MAYBE IF MOM FED LOUIS KITTEN FOOD
HE'D GROW FAST TOO MOM DIDN'T LIKE THAT IDEA KITTEN FOOD IS FOR KITTENS
SHE TOLD ME YOU
AND LOUIS NEED PEOPLE TOO
PEOPLE TO GROW YOU NEED
FROM
EACH OF THE FOUR FOOD
GRAPES
WHAT
ARE THE FOUR
FOOD GROUPS MOM I ASKED ONE GROUP
IS
DAIRY FOODS LIKE MILK AND
CHEESE
AND SECOND
GROUP
IS MEAT AND CHICKEN AND FISH EGGS AND NUTS ARE IN THE MEAT GROUP
TOO THE THIRD GROUP
IS BREADS IN
C CEREAL
AND THE FOURTH GROUP IS FRUITS AND VEGETABLES
I THOUGHT ABOUT THE PROBLEM WITH LOUIS MAYBE HE DID NOT EAT ENOUGH HE COULD NEVER GROW JUST EATING BABY FOOD
LOUIS
SHOULD EAT THE SAME FOODS THAT I EAT MAYBE
HE WOULD GROW FASTER I SAID
HE ONLY HAS TWO TEETH
AND
HE CAN'T CHEW
WELL I DIDN'T THINK OF THAT
LOUIS ONLY HAS TWO TEETH
IT CAN'T BE
FUN
BEING A BABY EV
EVEN FOR LOUIS I EAT ALL THE THINGS THAT MAKE ME GROW
I LIKE THE FOODS I EAT MAYBE THE PROBLEM WITH LUIS IS THAT
HE'S A BABY
HE CAN'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT SOON HE'LL GROW THEN HE'LL
BE THE REAL KID
JUST LIKE ME UNTIL THEN I'LL PUT WITH
MY KITTENS
UHM
LOUIS DOESN'T EAT VERY MUCH
AND THAT UHM
HE ONLY HAS TWO TEETH
AND HE HAS A BROTHER
THAT'S UHM SMART AND TRIES TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM SORTA
WHY LOUIS DOESN'T EAT VERY MUCH
UHM
A LITTLE SCARED
MAYBE
HE CAN'T PLAY AND HE D CAN'T DO VERY MANY THINGS WHEN HE CAN'T EAT A LOT WHEN HE DOESN'T EAT A LOT

GREEDY DOG
ILLUSTRATED BY KIM KELLY
WHAT A GREEDY
GREAT TIME
I'LL HAVE
EATING THIS MEAT WHEN I GOT HOME SAID BILL
THE DOG HE BEGAN TO CROSS A STREAM OF WATER
HE STOPPED SUDDENLY
AND LOOKED DOWN
INTO THE WATER
THERE WAS ANOTHER DOG
LOOKING BACK AT HIM
FROM
INSIDE THE STREAM
HEY
HE
HAS A BIGGER
WAIT
PIECE
OF MEAT THAN I DON'T
SAID HE SAID I WANT
THAT PIECE
AND I'M GOING TO GET S IT
BILL
GR
GROWLED
BUT THE DOG
IN THE WATER DID NOT MOVE
HE DIDN'T
DIDN'T
DROP
HIS MEAT
EITHER
BILL STIR
STARED STARED
VERY HARD AT THE DOG IN THE WATER
SCARE HIM
THE OTHER DOG WOULD DROP HIS MEAT
BILL
BARKED
AT THE
DOG
IN THE WATER HE WAS SOON SORRY
FOR THAT BECAUSE HE
BECAUSE THE MEAT SLIPPED FROM HIS MOUTH
AND SANK AND
AND TO THE BOTTOM OF THE STREAM
THE
DOG IN THE WATER LOU
LOST HIS MEAT
AT THE SAME TIME
AND
POOR
BILL WENT HOME HUNGRY
END
ONCE A LONG TIME AGO THERE WA WERE NO PINK ROSES
ALL THERE ROSE
IN
THE WORLD WERE WHITE
THERE
WEREN'T ANY RED
ONES ANY YELLOW ONES OR ANY PINK ONES THERE WERE ONLY WHITE ROSES
VERY EARLY ONE MORNING A LITTLE WHITE ROSE BUD
W WOKE UP SHE SAW THE SUN LOOK AT HER
HE STARTED TOO H
HARD HEARD THAT THE LITTLE WHITE ROSE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO
SO SHE SHE LOOKED UP AT HIM AND SAID WHY ARE YOU LOOKING AT ME SO HARD
BECAUSE YOU
ARE SO
BRIGHT SHE
PRETTY SAID THE BIG ROUND SUN
AND THE LITTLE WHITE ROSE
BLUSHED
SHE
TURNED
TURNED
PINK AFTER THAT ALL HER
CHILDREN
WERE LITTLE PINK ROSES
A DOG FOUND A PIECE OF MEAT AND HE WENT TO THE STREAM AND HE LOOKED DOWN
SIL
AND UHM HE SAW A DIFFERENT DOG AND HE WAS HE THOUGHT IT WAS A DIFFERENT DOG TRYING TO STEAL HIS OWN MEAT SO HE TRIED TO STEAL HIS
SIL
OK UHM AND THEN HE DROPPED HIS OWN MEAT THE DOG BUT IT WAS REALLY A REFLECTION OF HIS OWN SELF AND HE THOUGHT IT WAS A DIFFERENT DOG SO
br
AND SO HE DROPPED HIS MEAT
IT WAS ABOUT UHM A ROSE ROSES WERE ONLY LIKE UHM
br
WHITE AND THERE ARE NO RED NO BLUES NO ANY COLOR EXCEPT FOR WHITE
br
AND THEN THE S THEN THE SUN SAID YOU ARE SO BEAUTIFUL ONE MORNING AND THEN THEN THE ROSE UHM BLUSHED AND ALL HER CHILDREN WERE UHM PINK AND IT WAS VERY COOL
WHY DID PANDA WITH THE BEAUTIFUL GIRL NAME YIN YIN HAD HER CHANGED TO THE VERY BEAUTIFUL GIRL NAME COLUMBUS IF WAS FRED'S IDEA SO LET'S BEGIN WITH FRED
FRED FED THE PANDA BEARS AND THE TIGERS AND THE TURTLES THE TURLES WEREN'T SO BAD BUT AS FOR THE TIGERS HE WASN'T SO SURE
HE DIDN'T MIND HANDLING THE RAW MEAT AND
THE RAW MEAT HE HAD TO FEED TO THE TIGERS HIS MAIN
HIS MAIN OBJECTION WAS THE TO BEING EATEN
S NO ONE COULD BLAME FRED REALLY SINCE NO ONE REALLY WANTS TO BE EATEN
SO BEING EATEN WAS DEFINITELY NOT SOMETHING HE LOOKED FORWARD TO EACH AFTERNOON AT THREE O'CLOCK WHEN IT WAS TIME TO FEED THE TIGERS
SO FOR FRED WHEN IT CAME TO PANDAS HE HAD A WARM SPOT ON HIS HEART ACTUALLY IT WAS
EIGHTY FIVE POINT FIVE DEGREE SPOT ON HIS LEFT KIDNEY B
BUT THE POINT IS THAT
HE WAS VERY FOND OF THE FEEDING PANDAS
THERE WERE THREE PANDAS AND THEY WERE KNOWN AS THE PANDA PAN FAMILY
THEY WERE IN ORDER OF CUTENESS YIN YIN
THE YOUNG
MANY PEOPLE KNOW THAT PANDAS EAT BAMBOO
A LOT OF IT A LOT OF BAMBOO CAN GET V
QUITE HEAVY SO BECAUSE
OF THE PANDAS FRED BECAME VERY STRONG
AND WAS IN TERRIFIC SHAPE
BUT
PHYSICAL FITNESS WAS NOT THE ONLY REASON THAT FRED LOVED PANDAS THE OTHER REASON WAS THAT ANYONE WHO GETS WITHIN
THREE FEET OF A PANDA
AUTOMATICALLY FALLS IN LOVE WITH THEM
IT'S A LAW OF NATURE
AT
FURTHER DISTANCES PANDAS HAVE A STRANGE
ALMOST MAGICAL EFFECT ON
HUMAN BEINGS
WHICH
MAKES
US WANT TO HUG AND SQUEEZE
THINGS
FRED WAS NOT ALLOWED TO ACTUALLY HUG THE PANDA BEARS SINCE THAT
COULD
BE DANGEROUS SO ALL OF THE PEOPLE AT THE ZOO WOULD KNOW THE PANDAS HAD BEEN
FED WH WHEN THEY SAW FRED
HUG
ING
THE RATHER UN CUDDLY PALM TREES
OUTSIDE OF THE PANDA'S HOME
IT IS INTERESTING TO POINT
OUT AT THIS TIME
THAT MORE STUFFED PANDA BEARS
ARE SOLD AT ZOO GIFT SHOPS THEN ALL OF THE OTHER STUFF ANIMALS
COMBINED
THIS CAN ALMOST BE CERTAINLY
BE ANNOUNCED FOR BY STAY FOR
BY STAIN
T ALMOST MAGICAL EFFECT ON THE PANDAS POSSESS
BUT EVERYTHING
WAS NOT ALL BAMBOO
AND HUGS AT THE ZOO
ONE MORNING FRED WAS FEEDING YIN YIN AND SAID
OH YIN YIN I WISH
THAT MORE PEOPLE
WOULD COME
TO VISIT THE ZOO
I KNOW I SHOULDN'T BE TELLING YOU THIS BUT WE MIGHT HAVE
TO SELL
YOU AND YOUR FAMILY TO THE BIG ZOO
IN S SAN ANGELES
IF YOU WERE
IF
WE DON'T GET MORE MONEY
IT'S NOT THAT YOU AREN'T SELLING ENOUGH STUFFED PANDA BEARS
IT'S
JUST THAT THERE HASN'T HAVEN'T
BEEN ENOUGH PEOPLE COMING TO SEE YOU IN THE FIRST PLACE
I THINK
WHAT A ZOO NEEDS IS A GREAT
ANNIVERSARY
ANNIVERSARY
COMEDIAN
FRED WAS STARTING TO FEEL
THE
UNCOMFORTABLE
URGE
TO THE HUG OF
THE PANDA
SO BEFORE HE RAN OFF TO HUG THE PALM
TREE QUICKLY SAID
IT COSTS TOO MUCH IF YOU FEED PANDA BEARS I WOULD HATE IF
YOU HAD TO LEAVE US AFTER ALL
IT'S THE ONLY
HOME
YOU KNOW
BESIDES IF YOU LEAVE
I'LL GET TERRIBLY OUT OF SHAPE
NOW IF YOU EXCUSE ME I NEED TO SQUEEZE SOMETHING BEFORE I SCREAM
BUT YIN YIN THE YOUNG PANDA
WAS NOT
LISTENING TO FRED
SHE WAS TALKING TO HER BEST FRIEND MAGGIE
THE MAGPIE ABOUT GOING TO THE MOON
YES THE BIG ONE IN THE SKY
THAT IS
MOST LIKELY NOT MADE OF CHEESE AND MOST CERTAINLY NOT TO BE MADE OF BAMBOO
YIN YIN
HER BEST FRIEND MAGGIE
AND HER BEST FRIEND MAGGIE
THE PANDA
MAGPIE
WHO LOOKED A LOT LIKE
A PANDA
WOULD LOOK
IF PANDAS
WERE BIRDS
WERE
BIRDS
WERE DISCUSSING ABOUT
GOING TO THE MOON
HER MOTHER AND FATHER KNEW
WHAT
THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT SINCE THEY HADN'T THOUGHT
OR TALKED
OF MUCH ELSE SINCE YIN YIN SAID I WANT TO GO THERE AND POINTED TO THE MOON
ENOUGH A
OF THIS NONSENSE SAID YIN YIN'S MOTHER POO POO
WHAT SORT OF NONSENSE
IS THIS FA FOR A YOUNG
PANDA BEAR
GOING TO THE MOON INDEED NONSENSE YOUR JOB IS TO BE CUTE
SO PEOPLE WON'T RUN TO THE GIFT SHOP AND BUY AND BEAR DOLLS IT'S SIMPLE ECONOMICS
LIKE OR NOT
WE ARE SPOKES
PEOPLE WITH PANDA STUFFED ANIMAL
IN
AND DIRTY INDUSTRY
WHICH YOUNG LADY HELP
PAY FOR THE BAMBOO AND THAT YOU EAT
SUCH NONSENSE GOING TO THE MOON SAID HER MOTHER POO POO
BUT I JUST LEARNED HOW TO MAKE MYSELF INTO A BALL
AND ROLL TWO DAYS
AGO
AND I'VE IT BEEN
BECOMING
VERY GOOD AT IT
I DON'T THINK IT WILL TAKE THAT LONG TO ROLL THERE
SAID YIN YIN
YIN YIN'S FATHER
MOO MAN
DIDN'T THINK IT WAS VERY PROPER
OR WISE
WITH THERE
WHERE
PLACES WHERE THERE WASN'T ANY BAMBOO
BUT HE WAS SUPPORTIVE OF HIS YOUNG DAUGHTER AND SHOWED
HIS SUPPORT BY TAKING A NAP
BEFORE HE FELL
FELL TO SLEEP
HE DID MANAGE TO SAY I BELIEVE ROLLING
IN A
DECENTLY ROUND
ABOUT WAY TO GO
IF YOU MUST GO IT BE BEST TO FLY NONSENSE SAID
THE MOTHER
I'M SO MAD I'M
GOING
TO LOOK AT THAT LADY OVER THERE
AND MAKE HER WANT
HER SON CHEEKS
SHE SAID SPITEFULLY
AN INSTANT LATER
A YOUNG BOY WAS HEARD SAYING OUCH MOM CUT THAT OUT
I'M SORRY
TO SAY BUT
MANY LITTLE BOY'S CHEEKS HAVE BEEN OF RAW
WHEN MOTHER POO POO PANDA WAS UPSET
YIN YIN W WAS ALWAYS ONE
TO TAKE GOOD GOOD ADVANCE OF H
HER FATHER
AND LESS THAN A WEEK LATER YIN YIN AND MAGGIE HAD BUILT A ROCKET SHIP OUT OF BAMBOO BAMBOO IS VERY WORKABLE SUCCESS
AND PANDAS TEND TO HANDLE I BAMBOO
A LOT
SO IT S
THIS
IN ITSELF WILL NOT
THAT
ga
AT LEAST
TO THE YIN YINS PARENTS FRED
SURE WAS IMPRESSED THOUGH
THE MAIN
OB
OBSTACLE
IT TURNS OUT WAS GETTING THE ROCKET SHIP
OFF THE GROUND MAGGIE
FIGURED THAT
IF HER
AND THE THREE OF THE STRONGEST
MAGPIE FRIENDS WERE TO THE EACH GRAB HOLD OF CORNER
OF THE ROCKET SHIP THEY COULD ALL FLY
TO THE MOON
SO THEY TIRED ONE TWO THREE TO THE MOON
THEY SAID TOGETHER PULLING
WITH ALL THEIR MIGHT
I SEE YOU WINGS FLAPPING
BUT WE DON'T SEEM TO BE GOING ANYWHERE
SAID YIN YIN
HMM HEAVIER THAN I THOUGHT
I THINK WE NEED MORE MAGPIES
SAID MAGGIE YES BUT HOW MANY MORE
YIN YIN SAID I'M NOT SURE EXACTLY REPLIED MAGGIE
THE FATHER WATCHING THIS ALL THROUGH ONE EYE
FOR HE ALWAYS HAD AT LEAST
ONE EYE
ASLEEP AT ALL TIMES
SAID
SHE WANTED
BE MY BEST TO ASK THE OWL
THEN CLOSED HIS EYE
SO MAGGIE FLEW
TO THE OWL AND ASKED
T
FOR HIS ADVICE
OH WISE OWL I HAVE A QUESTION
THAT I FEAR ONLY YOU CAN ANSWER SHE SAID
HOW TO TURN YOUR HEAD
ALL
THE WAY AROUND
WITHOUT GETTING A TERRIBLE PAIN IN YOUR NECK SAID OWL
NO
HOW MANY MAGPIES WOULD BE NEEDING TO FLY A FOUR HUNDRED POUND PANDA BEAR AND ONE HUNDRED POUND BAMBOO ROCKET SHIP TO THE MOON
SAID MAGGIE
THE OWL INSTANTLY
REPLIED TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND AND SEVENTY SIX
GIVE OR TAKE TWO
A WEEK LATER MAGGIE MANAGED
TO ROUND UP TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND AND SEVENTY EIGHT MAGPIE
SHE COULD BE A VERY
PERS
T
LITTLE BIRD
WHEN SHE WANTED
A WEEK LATER DES
DESPITE
MUCH FLAPPING
THEY WERE STILL TRYING TO GET OUT GET
THE ROCKET IN THE AIR
IT TURNS OUT THAT OWL DIDN'T TAKE
INTO
CONSIDERATION
THAT
ONCE YOU GET OVER ONE THOUSAND MAGPIE TOGETHER THEY TEND
ATTEND
TURNS OUT
THAT
OWL DIDN'T TAKE
CONSIDERATION THAT ONCE YOU GET OVER A THOUSAND MAGPIE TOGETHER THEY CAN TEND TO FLY FLIGHT AND CAN'T AGREE ON
A SINGLE THING SINGLE THING
NOW WHILE ALL
WAS GOING ON
THE WHAT
DO YOU SUPPOSED FRED
WAS DOING
WHY HE
HE WAS FEEDING THE PANDAS
LIKE WHAT HE WAS SUPPOSED TO
SO ONE DAY AFTER FRED
HAD FED THE PANDAS
AND WERE HUGGING THE PALM TREE
THE ZOO MANAGER
CAME UP TO HIM
AND SAID WHAT IS GOING ON WITH YOUR PANDAS FRED I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT
IT'S TAKEN ME A COUPLE OF WEEKS TO FIGURE IT OUT
I THINK YIN YIN WANTS TO GO TO THE MOON
AND
THE MAGPIES WANT TO TAKE HER THERE SAID FRED
OH WELL THAT MAKES SENSE THEN
SAID THE MANAGER
DID YOU KNOW THAT SINCE THE LITTLE PANDA BUILT
THAT BAMBOO ROCKET SHIP
AND THOSE MAGPIES STARTED FLUTTERING
ABOUT THE ZOO'S
PROFITS HAVE GONE UP JUST FOUR THOUSAND
PERCENT
THIS IS JUST TYPE OF
EXPOSURE WE NEEDED
THOSE PANDA'S WILL
BE
WITH US FOR A LONG TIME FRED THOUGHT ABOUT IT AND SAID YOU THINK
YOU
KNOW THAT
ga YIN YIN
COLUMBUS THE ZOO KEEPER SAID GOOD HEAVENS
MAN THAT IS GREAT
IS A GREAT IDEA
NO WAIT A SECOND
I
SECOND I DON'T UNDERSTAND
WELL SIR WHEN COLUMBUS SET
SET OUT
ON HIS SHIP
HE REALLY T TRIED TO FIND A QUICKER WAY TO GET AROUND
EUROPE IN ORDER TO IMPROVE TRADE
HE WANTED A BUSINESS MAN
BUT INSTEAD BECAME A GREAT EXPLORER
YES BUT
WHY DOES THAT HAVE TO DO WITH PANDAS MAN SAID THE ZOO MANAGER WELL IT SEEMS TO ME MISS
ME SIR THAT YIN YIN WANTED TO BE A GREAT EXPLORER
AND INSTEAD
A BUSINESS WOMAN
I SEE FRED
ONE MORE THING SIR
ABOUT THOSE MAGPIE MAG
PIES FLYING AROUND
ABOUT FLY FLYING ABOVE THE PANDAS DO YOU THINK
THAT ZOO
COULD BE PURCHASED
ME AN UM
THE ZOO MANAGER LAUGHED AND WALKED AWAY BUT DID PURCHASE A FASHIONABLE YELLOW UMBRELLA FOR FRED THE NEXT DAY
BACK AT THE PANDA'S HOME
BACK AT THE PANDA'S HOME
IT WA
THE MOTHER PANDA POO POO
WAS VERY PROUD OF HER DAUGHTER
AFTER ALL
IF IT WEREN'T FOR YIN YIN THEY WOULD
HAVE TO HAD
TO MOVE FROM THEIR WONDERFUL HOME BUT LATER
WHEN FRED WALKED INTO
PANDA'S HOME
UNDER
UNDER HIS NEW YELLOW UMBRELLA
ALL
SHE COULD THINK WAS TO SAY NONSENSE AS FOR YIN YIN
SHE WAS VERY PROUD
TO RE
RE RENAMED
AFTER A FABULOUS EXPLORER
AND SHE AND MAGGIE NEVER STOPPED TRYING TO GET TO THE MOON
SOME PANDAS AND THE DAUGHTER SHE DID SOME WONDERFUL THINGS
SIL
DIDN'T WANT TO MOVE TO A DIFFERENT HOUSE
CAUSE SHE DID LOTS OF STUFF
SIL

JEFF GRIPPED THE CHAIN WITH ONE QUICK PUSH OFF THE PEDAL THE CHAIN WRAPPED AROUND THE GEAR
THERE HE SAID TO HIS FRIEND MIKE NOW TRY IT
MIKE RODE THE BICYCLE DOWN THE DRIVEWAY AND CIRCLED BACK TOWARD JEFF
JEFF
GEE THANKS HE SAID IT'S LIKE A BRAND NEW BIKE JEFF GRINNED HE LIKED FIXING THINGS THEN HE LOOKED UP JUST IN TIME TO SEE HIS NEW PUPPY RUNNING UP THE HILL
MOM HE CRIED THERE GOES PUDDLES CAN WE GO AFTER HI HIM ON OUR BIKES
JEFF'S MOM LOOKED OUT THE WINDOW YES BUT COME HOME IN TIME TO DO YOUR HOMEWORK REMEMBER YOU MUST TURN
IN YOUR IDEAS FOR YOUR SCIENCE FAIR PROJECT TOMORROW
NOW DO I
DO I PUSH NEXT NOW
THE BOYS JUMPED ON THEIR BIKES AND HEADED
UP THE HILL THEY SAW PUDDLES UP AHEAD
HIS GOLDEN EARS FLOPPED UP AND DOWN AS HE RAN OVER THE HILLTOP THE BOY PUSHED THE BOYS PUSHED HARDER ON THE PEDALS AS THEY CLIMBED THE STEEP HILL
CHANGE YOUR GEARS MIKE YELLED JEFF
JEFF WATCHED AS MIKE'S AS MIKE'S CHAIN SLIPPED OVER A LARGER GEAR
AT THE TOP OF THE HILL THE BOYS STOPPED TO CATCH THEIR BREATH
MIKE WAS PUZZLED JEFF WHY DID SHIFTING MAKE IT EASIER TO PEDAL
I DON'T KNOW IT'S JUST GOT SOMETHING TO DO DO WITH THE GEARS ANSWERED JEFF
I'M JUST GLAD HE WO THAT WE WON'T NEED TO PEDAL SO HARD GOING DOWN THE HILL
THE BOYS LOOKED DOWN THE HILL BELOW THEY COULD SEE THE ROLLER COASTER IN THE NEW AMUSEMENT PARK
THE PARK WAS CALLED FUN STATION LOOK AT THOSE HILLS MIKE I I'LL BET WE COULD NEED SOME BIG GEARS I BET WE WOULD
NEED TO BIG GEARS TO CLIMB CLIMB UP AND STRONG LEGS TOO ADDED MIKE
JEFF LOOKED DOWN AT THE FUN STATION FENCE
THERE WAS PUDDLES DIGGING UNDER THE GATE OH NO HE GROANED MOM SAID THAT
FUN STATION WAS OFF LIMITS UNTIL IT OPENS NEXT SUMMER
THE BOYS COASTED DOWN THE HILL ALL THEIR UPHILL PEDALING PAID
PAID OFF JEFF WONDERED HOW FAST THEY WERE GOING
AND HE IMAGINED HOW FAST THEY COULD GO ON THE ROLLER COASTER
JEFF AND MIKE SQUEEZED THEIR HAND THEIR HAND BRAKES TO SLOW DOWN WHEN THEY REACHED THE FENCE JEFF DROPPED TO HIS KNEES HE PEERED THROUGH THE HOLE
PUDDLES WAS NOWHERE IN SIGHT
PUDDLES PUD PUDDLES MIKE AND JEFF SHOUTED BUT PUDDLES DID NOT RETURN THEN OVER THE SOUNDS OF THE WORKERS THEY HEARD A FAMILIAR BARK
UH
FROM THE OTHER SIDE OF THE FENCE A WOMAN SPOKE HAVE YOU LOST YOUR DOG YES CRIED JEFF DO YOU HAVE PUDDLES WELL SAID THE WOMAN I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S IF IT'S PUDDLES BUT I HAVE A FRIENDLY LITTLE COCKER SPANIEL HERE THAT'S PUDDLES CRIED JEFF CAN YOU
MAKE HIM COME BACK THROUGH THIS HO THE THIS HOLE THE WOMAN LAUGHED HERE IT BE EASIER FOR PUDDLES PUDDLES IF I OPEN THE GATE
IN A FEW MINUTES PUDDLES WAS IN JEFF'S ARMS JEFF HUGGED HIM HARD PUDDLES WIGGLED TO GET FREE BUT JEFF WASN'T ABOUT TO LET HIM ESCAPE AGAIN
JEFF LOOKED UP THE
WOMAN THANK YOU FOR BRINGING PUDDLES OUT NO TH NO PROBLEM SAID THE YOUNG WOMAN MY NAME'S LISA I'M ONE OF THE ENGINEERS BUILDING THE GREAT GRAVITY MACHINE I WAS PLAYING WITH PUDDLES WHEN I HEARD YOU YOU CALL
WHAT'S THE GREAT GRAVITY MACHINE ASKED JEFF A THAT'S THE NAME OF THE ROLLER COASTER LISA POINTED TOWARD THE BIG STEEL STEEL HILLS
WOW IT'S HUGE SAID MIKE
I CAN SEE WHY THEY CALL IT GREAT BUT WHY ABOUT BUT WHAT ABOUT GRAVITY
WELL GRAVITY IS A FORCE A FORCE PUSHES OR PULLS THINGS EXPLAINED LISA
ON A ROLLER COASTER THE CARS WRAPS ARE ATTACHED TO A CHAIN THAT WRAPS AROUND GEARS
WHEN AN ENGINE TURNS THE GEARS THE CHAIN PULLS THE CARS UP THE H FIRST IT FIRST HILL THE FIRST HILL IS ALWAYS THE HIGHEST ONE
WHEN CARS REACH THE TOP THE FORCE OF GRAVITY PULLS THEM DOWN THE HILL
WHEN THEY REACH THE BOTTOM THE CARS ARE GOING FAST IS ENOUGH TO GET UP THE NEXT HILL BY THEMSELVES
BY THEMSELVES
YEAH JEFF NODDED GRAVITY IS WHY WE
COASTED SO FAST DOWN THE HILL THE HILL ON OUR BIKES THAT'S RIGHT LISA REPLIED YOUR BICYCLE AND THE ROLLER COASTER BOTH USE GRAVITY
BUT THERE THERE IS ONE BIG DIFFERENCE YOUR BIKE HAS PEDALS THE ROLL COASTER CARS HAVE NO PEDALS AND NO ENGINE
THE ROLLER COASTER IS MADE OF SEVERAL S SEVERAL SIMPLE MACHINES SIMPLE MACHINES HAVE ONLY ONE OR TWO PARTS
ONE SIMPLE MACHINE IS AN INCLINED PLANE
THAT'S JUST ANOTHER NAME FOR A RAMP
A RAMP IS A MACHINE ASKED MIKE
SURE SAID LISA A MACHINE IS ANYTHING THAT HELPS YOU DO THINGS MORE EASILY SUPPOSE THAT YOU HAD TO CLIMB STRAIGHT UP FROM THE GROUND TO THE TOP OF THE ROLLER COAST OF THAT ROLLER COASTER HILL
THAT WOULD BE TOUGH SAID JEFF IT IS MUCH EASIER FOR ROLLER COASTER TO CLIMB A RAMP THEN
THAN GO TO GO STRAIGHT UP EXPLAINED LISA THEN MIKE HAD AN IDEA OUR BIKES GO UP HILL
GO UP HILL ARE THEY MACHINES
LISA NODDED YOUR BIKE YOUR BIKE IS MADE OF SEVERAL SIMPLE MACHINES THE PEDALS HELP YOU TURN THE WHEELS THE PEDALS ARE PART OF A SIMPLE MACHINE CALLED THE WHEEL AND AXLE
THE HAND BRAKES ARE SIMPLE MACHINES CALLED LEVERS HOW ABOUT THE GEARS ASKED MIKE YOU'RE RIGHT GEARS ARE ALSO SIMPLE MACHINES ANSWERED LISA
JUST THEN PUDDLES JUMPED FROM JEFF'S ARMS
JEFF
JEFF CAUGHT THE PUPPY AND CL AND CLIPPED ON HIS LEASH I GUESS PUDDLES THINKS IT'S TIME TO GO HOME LAUGHED JEFF
JEFF
PUDDLES
PULLED AT HIS LEASH WHILE THE BOYS THANKED THANKED LISA
YOU'RE VERY WELCOME SHE SAID COME BACK THIS SUMMER AND LET ME KNOW
HOW YOU LIKE THE ROLLER COASTER RIDE
AS THE BOYS TURNED HOME MIKE THOUGHT ABOUT HIS HOMEWORK I KNOW WHAT I'M GOING TO DO FOR THE SCIENCE FAIR HE ANNOUNCED I'M GOING TO FIGURE OUT HOW THE GEARS WORK ON MY BIKE JEFF SMILED HE PLANNED TO B TO BUILD A ROLLER COASTER FOR HIS CAR COLLECTION HE'D CALL IT THE LITTLE GRAVITY MACHINE
THE GREEDY DOG ILLUSTRATED BY KIM KELLEY
WHAT A GREAT TIME I'LL HAVE
EATING THIS MEAT WHEN I GET HOME SAID BILL THE DOG HE BEGAN TO CROSS A
CROSS A STREAM OF
HE STOPPED SUDDENLY AND LOOKED DOWN INTO THE WATER AND ANOTHER DOG LOOKING BACK AT HIM FROM INSIDE THE STREAM
HEY HE HAS A BIGGER PIECE OF MEAT THAN I DO HE HE SAID I WANT
I WANT THAT PIECE AND I AM AND I'M GOING TO GET IT
BILL GROWLED BUT THE DOG IN THE WATER DID NOT MOVE HE DIDN'T DROP HIS MEAT EITHER
BILL STARED VERY HARD AT THE DOG IN THE WATER BILL THOUGHT IF THAT IF HE C THAT IF HE COULD SCARE HIM THAT THE OTHER DOG WOULD DROP HIS MEAT
BILL BARKED AT THE DOG IN THE WATER HE WAS HE WAS SORRY FOR THAT
BECAUSE MEAT SLIPPED FROM
HIS MOUTH AND SANK TO THE BOTTOM OF THE STREAM THE DOG IN THE WATER LOST HIS MEAT AT THE SAME TIME AND POOR BILL WENT HOME HUNGRY
THEY LEARNED THAT UHM LIKE SORT OF A RAMP MIGHT BE A IS A SIMPLE MACHINE PEDALS ARE SIMPLE MACHINES AND OTHER STUFF IS JUST LIKE SIMPLE MACHINES AND SO THEY HAVE SO BASICALLY THEY LE AND THEY ALSO LEARNED ABOUT GRAVITY TOO THAT GRAVITY HELPS LIKE PULLS THINGS DOWN AND IF WE SORT OF DIDN'T HAVE GRAVITY RIGHT NOW WE WE WOULD BE FLOATING UP IN AIR
UHM WELL BILL THE DOG BASICALLY HE WAS HE BASICALLY WAS BARKING AT HIS SHADOW THINKING THAT I MEAN THE REFLECTION IN THE WATER AND HE WAS THINKING THAT THAT IT HAD A BIGGER MEAT AND SO HE WAS JUST BARKING AT HIM STARING AT IT TRYING BECAUSE ITS HIS REFLECTION LOOKED LIKE IT HAD A BIGGER PIECE OF MEAT AND HE HE WAS JUST THINKING HEY THAT D THAT DOG HAS A BIGGER PIECE OF MEAT I WANT THAT MEAT SO SO BASICALLY HE'S JUST BARKING AT IT AND STARTING AT IT AND TRYING AND HE HAS NO IDEA THAT'S JUST HIS OWN REFLECTION
SIL
AND SO AND THEN FINALLY HE HE BARKS AT IT AND HE DROPS HIS MEAT AND IT SINKS TO THE BOTTOM OF THE STREAM AND HE HAS TO GO HOME HUNGRY WITHOUT HIS MEAT

ONCE A LONG TIME AGO THERE WAS A FARMER
HE HAD A PRETTY HORSE AND A SMALL DONKEY
THE HORSE ALWAYS HAD LOTS TO EAT A AND HAD A BATH EVERY WEEK
THE DONKEY HAD TO EAT TRASH AND WAS VERY DIRTY
ONE DAY BOTH ANIMALS GOT READY TO GO TO THE MARKET
THE FARMER PUT A SADDLE ON THE HORSE
HE PUT TWO BIG SACK

THE DONKEY WAS A VERY GOOD ANIMAL
HE WORKED HARD AND NEVER COMPLAINED

THE HORSE HELD
HIS HEAD VERY HIGH WHILE THE DONKEY WAS TALKING
THEN HE SAID YOU LAZY BOY I DON'T WANT
TO HELP YOU
I WON'T CARRY BAGS LIKE A DONKEY NO I WILL NOT TAKE
ANY OF YOUR LOAD
THE DONKEY HAD TO STOP HE FELL TO THE ROAD HE COULD NOT GET UP AGAIN
AT THE END OF THE
DAY THE HORSE GOT TO THE MARKET
EVERY BONE IN HIS BODY HURT
HE WAS SO TIRED THAT HE COULD NOT WALK
IF ONLY HE HAD HELPED THE DONKEY
ONCE UPON A TIME A TORT
TORTOISE LIVED IN A PO POND WITH TWO DUCKS
THEY WERE HER VERY GOOD FRIENDS SHE LIKES
LIKED
THE DUCKS SHE COULD TALK WITH THEM AS MUCH AS SHE LIKED
THE TORTOISE LIKED TO TALK SHE LIKED THE SOUND HER OF HER VOICE
THE TORTOISE AND THE DUCKS LIVED TO
TOGETHER FOR A LONG TIME THEN THE POND RAN OUT OF OUT OF WATER THE DUCKS AND
THE TORTOISE HAD NO WATER TO SWIM IN
THE TWO DUCKS COULD NOT LIVE
WITHOUT WATER
THEY WERE GOING TO FLY AWAY TO MORE WATER
THEY WENT TO THE TORTOISE TO SAY GOODBYE
OH DON'T LEAVE ME SAID THE TORTOISE
TAKE ME WITH YOU I WILL DIE IF I STAY HERE BUT YOU
YOU CAN NOT FLY SAID THE DUCKS HOW CAN WE TAKE YOU WITH US
TAKE ME WITH YOU TAKE ME WITH YOU SAID THE TORTOISE

IF YOU OPEN YOUR MOUTH YOU WILL FALL
THE TORTOISE SAID SHE WOULD NOT SAY A WORD
SHE WOULD NOT EVEN MOVE HER MOUTH
SHE WAS VERY HAPPY SO THE DUCKS GOT A STRONG STICK
AND HELD THE END
THE TORTOISE BIT THE MIDDLE
AWAY WITH THEIR FRIEND
THEY WERE HIGH OVER THE TREES
THE TORTOISE WANTED TO SAY HOW HIGH WE ARE BUT SHE COULD NOT TALK

FLICKERS ON THE BACK OF BOOKS

OF CITY
BLAZING IN THE FIRE TILL AS I GAZE WITH STARRY EYES THE ARMIES FADE
THE ga DIES
AN THEN ONCE AGAIN THE GLOW RETURNS AGAIN
THE PHANTOM CITY BURNS AND DOWN THE RED HOTS
VALLEY LO
THE
ga ARMIES MARCHES GO
BLINDING AMBERS TELL ME TRUE WHERE ARE THESE ARMIES MARCHING TO AND WHAT THE BURNING CITY IS THAT CRUMBLES IN YOUR
FURNACES FURNACES
SINCE DEAR MOM AND DAD PARENTS SINCE YOU HAVE
GROUNDED ME AND TOLD ME TO WRITE DOWN WHY I AM SORRY BEFORE I WAS ALONE OUT OF MY ROOM I AM
MAD AT YOU ARE I
WON'T LIKE TO START BY SAYING THAT I THINK
THAT YOU
ARE VERY MEAN TO MAKE ME DO THIS BECAUSE IT WASN'T EVEN MY FAULT I COULDN'T HELP IT ANYWAY IT WAS AN ACCIDENT AND I
DIDN'T EVEN DO IT ON PURPOSE I REALLY DIDN'T MEAN TO SHAVE THE CAT REALLY I SWEAR
OK HERE'S WHAT HAPPENED AS I REMEMBER IT I SAW
THAT THE CAT WAS TRYING TO GET
THE
GERBILS GERBILS AND
YOU TOLD US TO
YOU USE
WE COULDN'T HIT ANIMALS SO I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT ELSE TO DO SO I GRABBED DAD'S NOSE
HAIR CLIPPERS AND SHAVED IT
YOU SHOULDN'T BE PROUD OF ME FOR THINKING SO FAST
ON MY TOES OR SURE IT'S EASY TO SAY THAT I SHOULD HAVE JUST PICKED THE CAT UP AND BUT SOMETHING WE DON'T ALWAYS THINK ALL THAT GREAT UNDER
PR
PRESSURE AND YOU KNOW WHAT THESE STUPID GERBILS DIDN'T EVEN THANK ME
THEY JUST RAN AND
ON THE S
WHEEL
AND DID STUPID THINGS THAT'S THE LAST TIME
I SH
A SHAVE THE CAT TO PROTECT ANY STUPID GERBILS
BESIDE THE REAL REASON I SHAVED THE CAT WAS TO KEEP IT NICE AND COOL I JUST DIDN'T WANT TO SEE THE CAT
GETTING ALL HOT AND UNCOMFORTABLE AND STUFF
YOU GAZE WILL JUST PROBABLY SAY IT'S WINTER
DANNY CATS DON'T
OVERHEAT IN WINTER
BUT SO WHAT IF IT'S WINTER
I MEAN IT'S BE SUMMER SOON ENOUGH AND I JUST WANT
THE CAT
TO GUESS
USING TO THE IDEAS BEFORE IT
GOT REALLY HOT PLUS OSCAR MY TURTLE TOLD ME TO SHAVE THE CAT
B
TALK
BUT IF HE COULD HE SHE WOULD HAVE SAID PLEASE SHAVE THE CAT IT KEEPS HITTING ME ON THE SHELL
AND TRYING TO ROLL ME OVER
WHEN YOU LEAVE THE ROOM YOU GUESS NEVER LIKE OSCAR AS MUCH AS THE CAT
ANYWAY YOU WOULDN'T ALWAYS TAKE THE CAT'S SIDE IF YOU SIDE KNEW THE STUFF HE DIDN'T DID TO ME MY POOR TURTLE
CAT'S AREN'T ALWAYS NICE JUST LIKE MY SISTER JENNY ISN'T ALWAYS NICE
BUT THE REAL REASON
I SHAVED THE CAT WAS TO MAKE A WIG FOR THOSE POOR WAS HAIRLESS CATS
THAT WE SAW ON T V ON THE ANIMAL CHANNEL I KNEW OUR CAT WOULD GROW HER FUR BACK
BUT HER HAIRLESS CAT AND THEY NEED FUR IN
THE WINTER SOMETIMES I THINK I SWEAR THAT'S THE REASON ALSO I WAS GOING TO SELL THE CAT FUR AND BUY MY SISTER JENNY S JENNY
ACES FOR HER BIG STUPID FACE
PLUS I FORGOT TO TELL YOU THAT
YOU SHOULD BE BLAMING MRS
NOT MRS CASPER
MY SCIENCE TEACHER SHE M MADE US SHAVE SOMETHING FOR SCIENCE ASK HER SHE SAID THAT
WENT WHEN
HER SHAVE HAIR IT GREW BACK
HA
ga
AND SOMETHING EVEN DARKER
SO I THOUGHT THAT I IF I COULD SHAVE THE CAT
A LOT OF A BUNCH OF TIMES HER HAIR WOULD GROW BACK
I DO EACH TIME AND SOON SHE WOULD HAVE AN INVISIBLE COAT OF CAT FUR ARMOR
THEN SHE WOULD
BE A SUPER CAT
ON YOUR
COULD TAKE HER ON T V
SHOWS AND GET
LOTS OF MONEY SO THAT YOU CAN SEND JENNY TO COLLEGE
EVEN IF SHE IS A DUMB LITTLE TATTLE TALE
SHE'S
SO GOOD AT SCHOOL AND YOU BOUGHT HER A CAT
CAUSE SHE'S SO RESPONSIBLE AND STUFF
THAT SHE DIDN'T BRUSH HER TEETH
OH YEAH I FORGOT
YOU THAT MOM AND DAD JENNY DIDN'T BRUSH HER TEETH LAST NIGHT I THINK THAT SHE SHOULD BRUSH HER TEETH TWICE
TONIGHT
THAT'S JUST MY
OP
OH
WHAT
OPINION
SO
DREW I'LL GET YOU DIDN'T KNOW SOMETHING ELSE
DID YOU KNOW THAT I WANT
ED TO DO A BARB
I WAS AFRAID TO TELL YOU THE REALLY REASON I SHA SHAVED THE CAT WAS THAT I WENT WANT TO BE A BARBER AND I NEEDED
PRACTICE I WAS AFRAID YOU WOULDN'T LET ME PRACTICE ON MY OWN HEAD CAN I
THEN I DID ON THE CAT CAUSE NOW I HAVE
WENT DAD CALLED LIFE
EX
AND ST
NOT THAT I SHAVED THE CAT
TH
ACTUALLY
THE TRUTH IS THAT I BY
ACCIDENT TURN ON THE NOSE HAIR CLIPPERS AND THE CAT WAS BEING CHASED BY THE TURTLE AND RAN RIGHT BY THE CLIPPERS AND SHAVED HERSELF I KEPT SAYING NO KITTY
NO DON'T SHAVE YOURSELF
BUT MY STUPID SISTER NEVER THOUGHT HER CAT HOW TO LISTEN SO
SHE JUST IGNORED ME SHE SAYS NOT SO RESPONSIBLE AFTER ALL
IF I HAD A CAT I WOULDN'T TEACH IT
TO NOT SHAVE ITSELF THAT'S FOR SURE
HAVE YOU GOT GOOD GRADES TO KNOW IF YOU SHOULD TEACH A CAT
TO SHAVE ITSELF
PLUS IF YOU WERE ALWAYS CUDDLING WITH MY SISTER SO MUCH MAYBE SHE
WOULD
HAVE BEEN WITH HER CAT
INSTEAD
THE CAT CAME INTO MY DAD AND BECAUSE JENNY NEVER PLAYS WITH IT ENOUGH
THE CAT LIKES BEING
SAVED AWAY SO I DON'T
SEE THE BIG DEAL I THINK IT REALLY LIKE ITS HAIRCUT THE ONLY REASON IT HASN'T COME OUT FOR TWO WEEKS IS BECAUSE YOU IT GUYS MADE SURE A BIG DEAL ABOUT IT POOR KITTY
THIS
THIS AND POOR KITTY
THAT IT'S
YOUR FAULT REALLY DAD PLEASE DON'T READ THE NEXT PART
DEAR MOM DON'T LET DAD KNOW THAT THE REAL REASON I SHAVED THE CAT
WAS THAT HE'S ALWAYS SNEEZING AROUND IT
I KNOW HOW MUCH YOU GET HIM ALWAYS SNEEZING AND STUFF SO I THOUGHT IF I GOT RID OF HIS FUR HE WOULDN'T SNEEZE AND THAT
YOU WOULD HAVE A BETTER
ga SO I IT REALLY
SO IT WAS REALLY MY FATHER
FATHER'S DAY
GIFT TO HIM SO I COULDN'T BUY HIM
ANYTHING NICE SINCE YOU TOOK AWAY MY ALLOWANCE FOR WHEN I SHAVED THE NEIGHBOR'S DOG
HOW COME JENNY'S GETS
A CAT AND I GET A STUPID TURTLE ANYWAYS TURTLES DON'T DO ANYTHING EXCEPT POKE THEIR HEADS OUT AND BE NOT CUDDLY CAN I GET A DOG PLEASE SO IN CONCLUSION I'M GETTING HUNGRY AND I'M SORRY FOR SHAVING THE CAT
ALL OH YOU CAN SEE THAT IT'S REALLY JENNY'S FAULT FOR NOT BEING AS RESPONSIBLE AS YOU ALWAYS SAY AND NOT BRUSHING HER TEETH P S IF YOU COULD
HAVE BOUGHT HER A TURTLE
I COULDN'T HAVE SHAVED IT SINCERELY DANNY
ABOUT AN ARMY AND IT'S IN THE FIREPLACE IT LOOKS LIKE
UHM THIS BOY GETS IN TROUBLE BECAUSE HE SHAVED HIS CATS
UHM HE'S BLAMING IT ON JENNY HIS SI LITTLE SISTER
UHM
SIL
AND HE SAYS IF UHM YOU WOULD HAVE HE UHM IS BLAME AND HE ALSO BLAMED IT ON HIS DAD WELL HE SAID IT'S HIS DAD'S UHM FATHER'S DAY GIFT BECAUSE HE IT SOUNDED LIKE HE WAS ALLERGIC TO THE CAT

JUSTIN AND HIS HAT
ONE DAY JUSTIN AND HIS MOTHER WENT SHOPPING FOR HATS AND FOUND THE PERFECT ONE
BUT JUSTIN WOULD NEVER WEAR THE HAT AND HE TH AND THAT MADE HIS MOM ROLL HER EYES
IT WASN'T THAT HE DIDN'T LIKE THE HAT IN FACT HE LOVED IT
HE THOUGHT IT WAS GREAT IT TOTALLY FIT HIS HEAD
HE LOVED IT THE WAY A LITTLE TIGHT TIGHT AT FIRST BUT IT THEN STRETCHED TO THE PERFECT SIZE
br EVEN LIKED THE WAY HIS HAIR LOOKED WHEN HE TOOK OFF THE HAT
SIL
UNFORTUNATELY JUSTIN WAS TOO SMART FOR HIS OWN GOOD
HE FIGURED OUT THAT THE HAT WOULD GET DIRTY OR LOST IF HE WORE IT TOO MUCH SO HE MADE A PROMISE TO HIMSELF THAT HE WOULD NEVER WEAR IT EXCEPT ON SPECIAL DAYS
HE WANTED THE HAT TO BE CLEAN AND PERFECT FOREVER
IF IT GETS DIRTY I'LL WASH IT SILLY SAID HIS MOTHER
BUT IT'LL SHRINK IF YOU WASH IT AND THEN IT'LL BE TOO SMALL HE SAID
HIS FATHER SAID YOU SHOULD REALLY WEAR THAT HAT IF YOU LIKE IT OR ELSE YOU WILL BE SORRY
BUT JUSTIN JUST DIDN'T LISTEN AND EVERYDAY THE HAT SAT ON THE CLEAR BLUE PLASTIC BOX SO THAT IT WOULDN'T GET DIRTY
SIL
SOMETIMES JUSTIN IMAGINED HIMSELF WALKING AROUND SCHOOL WITH THE HAT ON HIS HEAD
ONCE HE EVEN IMAGINED HIMSELF AS A GROWN UP WEARING THE HAT AND SPEAKING IN FRONT OF MANY PEOPLE
HE IMAGINED THAT THE PEOPLE WHISPERED TO THEMSELVES WHAT A FINE SPEAKER HE IS AND SUCH A HANDSOME HAT TOO
ON HIS NEXT BIRTHDAY HE DECIDED TO WEAR THE HAT
THERE WERE MANY PRESENTS BUT THE ONLY THING THAT MADE JUSTIN EXCITED W JUSTIN EXCITED WAS GETTING TO WEAR HIS HAT
WHEN HE WENT TO HIS ROOM AND OPENED THE PLASTIC BOX AND TOOK IT OUT VERY CAREFULLY THEN HE SLOWLY SLID IT ON
IT WAS J A LITTLE TIGHT AT FIRST LIKE IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE
AND THEN HE REMEMBERED HOW HAPPY HE WAS AND HE COULDN'T HELP SMILE
I KNOW IT'S JUST A HAT HE THOUGHT TO HIMSELF BUT I'D
SIL
BUT I SURE DO LOVE IT
THEN HE NOTICED THAT IT WAS WASN'T STRETCHING
SOMETHING WAS WRONG IT WAS A LITTLE TIGHT JUSTIN COULD TELL IT WASN'T PERFECT ANYMORE
HE KNEW CRYING WOULDN'T HELP MAKE THE HAT PERFECT AGAIN BUT HE CRIED ANYWAY
HE TOLD HIS PARENTS I DON'T WANT ANY OF THOSE GIFTS I WANT TO RETURN THEM ALL AND TRY TO FIND A NEW PERFECT HAT INSTEAD
HIS PARENTS LOOKED AT EACH OTHER AND KNEW THAT JUSTIN HAD LEARNED A GOOD LESSON
SON WE WOULD BE HAPPY TO BUY YOU A NEW HAT BUT ONLY IF YOU PROMISE TO WEAR IT HIS FATHER SAID
JUSTIN REPLIED I PROMISE THAT IF WE FIND THE PERFECT HAT I'LL WEAR IT EVERYDAY
SO THE NEXT DAY JUSTIN AND HIS MOTHER WENT SHOPPING FOR HATS AND HE FOUND THE PERFECT ONE
FROM THEN ON JUSTIN WOULD NEVER TAKE IT OFF AND MADE AND HIS AND IT MADE HIS MOM ROLL HIS ROLL HER EYES
OK IT'S A STORY ABOUT A BOY AND HE REALLY
HE GETS THIS HAT THAT HE REALLY REALLY LIKES BUT HE DOESN'T WANT TO WEAR IT CAUSE FOR FEAR OF RUINING IT
BUT HIS MOTHER REALLY WANTS HIM TO WEAR IT
AND HE ONLY WEARS IT ON SPECIAL OCCASIONS AND ON ONE OF HIS BIRTHDAYS HE WANTS TO WEAR IT AND IT'S TOO SMALL BECAUSE HE WAITED SO LONG TO WEAR IT
AND SO HE NEVER GOT TO WEAR IT WHEN IT FIT
AND SO HE LEARNED A LESSON THAT IF YOU GET SOMETHING YOU REALLY LIKE MAYBE HE SHOULD PLAY WITH IT
NOT BE SO CAREFUL NOT TO RUIN IT AND ALL THAT

CHEESE AND YOGURT ARE BOTH MADE FROM MILK SO THEY ARE CALLED DAIRY FOODS
MORE THAN NINETY PERCENT OF THE HUMAN BODY IS MADE UP OF WATER
GO WHEN HIS OWNERS GOT HIM AS A SIL PUPPY ALL HE WANTED TO DO WAS RUN AND RUN SO HIS OWNERS NAMED HIM RACER
WHEN HE GOT OLDER HE DEVELOPED PROBLEMS WITH HIS BACK LEGS
EVERY TIME HE RAN HE WOULD LIMP BUT THAT DIDN'T STOP HIM FROM RUNNING BECAUSE HE LIKE BECAUSE LIKE MOST DOGS RACER LOVED TO RUN
THERE WAS A DOG PARK NEAR WHERE HE LIVED HE ENJOYED PLAYING AT THE DOG PARK BECAUSE HE DIDN'T HAVE TO BE ONE ON HIS LEASH
WHEN HE WAS THERE SO HE COULD RUN AS MUCH AS HE LIKED
THERE WAS ONE DOG AT THE DOG PARK NAMED FANG
HE WOULD ALWAYS COME TO RACER AND BITE HIS BACK LEG AND RUN AWAY SAYING BARK BARK BARK BARK
WHICH HIS ga DOG TALK MEANS YOU ARE TOO SLOW TO CATCH ME THAT LIMP OF YOURS
SO I AM GOING TO PICK ON YOU RACER WOULD ALWAYS CHASE FANG BUT HE COULD NEVER CATCH HIM
ONE DAY RACER WENT TO THE VET RACER LIKED THE VET BECAUSE THE PEOPLE IN THE WHITE COATS GAVE HIM TREATS
RACER DIDN'T KNOW IT BUT HE WAS AT THE VET TO HAVE SURGERY TO FIX HIS LEGS
WHEN HE WOKE UP FROM THE SURGERY HE DIDN'T EVEN REMEMBER WHERE HIS WHERE HE WAS BUT SOON HIS OWNERS CAME AND DROVE HIM HOME
W ON THE DRIVE HOME RACER REALIZED THAT HIS LEGS INCHED A INCHED VERY BADLY
HE THOUGHT OH BOY I'M GOING TO LICK MY LEG SO HARD THAT THE ITCHING IS GOING TO GO AWAY
SO HE TURNED HIS HEAD AROUND TO LICK HIS LEG BUT THERE WAS A BIG WHITE THING IN ITS WAY
HE WAS LIKE WEARING A COLLAR THAT MADE IT IMPOSSIBLE TO LICK HIS LEG
A FEW DAYS LATER HE WENT WITH HIS OWNER TO THE DOG PARK RACER HAD TO BE ON A LEASH SINCE HE STILL NEEDED TO HEAL FROM H HIS SURGERY
BUT IT WAS NICE TO SEE ALL HIS FRIENDS
MEAN OLD FANG SAID BARK BARK BARK BARK WHICH MEANT WHY DO YOU HAVE TO WEAR THAT STUPID LOOKING COLLAR IT SURE LOOKS S SILLY ga
EVENTUALLY RACER DIDN'T HAVE TO WEAR THE COLLAR BUT THEN HIS LEGS DIDN'T T ITCH SO HE DIDN'T WANT TO LICK THEM
FOR SIX WEEKS RACER WOULD TAKE WALKS AND GO TO THE DOG PARK BUT HE STILL HAD TO BE ON HIS LEASH SIL
ONE DAY HE TOOK A WALK TO THE DOG PARK AND ALL HIS FRIENDS WERE THERE AS USUAL
THEN HIS OWNER REACHED AROUND HIS NECK AND TOOK OFF HIS LEASH JUST THEN FANG BIT HIM ON THE BACK LEG AND RAN AWAY
RACER'S OWNER SAID GO RUN S SO RACER STARTED RUNNING AND CHASING FANG
FANG WAS LAUGHING BECAUSE HE KNEW RACER COULD NEVER CATCH HIM BUT SUDDENLY HE NOTICED THAT RACER WAS RACER WAS CAS CATCHING UP TO HIM
BUT RACE RACER WAS RUNNING FASTER THAN HE COULD EVER REMEMBER AND BEFORE HE KNEW IT HE HAD CAUGHT UP TO FANG AND KNOCKED HIM DOWN RACER SAID BARK BARK WHICH IN DOG TALK MEANS DON'T PICK ON ME ANYMORE FANG
AND FROM THAT DAY ON FANG NEVER BIT RACER'S LEG
RACER WAS SO HAPPY THAT HE COULD RUN AS FAST AS HE RAN IN CIRCLES
br FINALLY HE RAN BACK TO HIS OWNERS AND GAVE HIM BIG KISSES FOR FIXING HIS LEGS
RIGHT NOW
IN THIS STORY UM THERE WAS A DOG NAMED RACER br
AND HE WAS ALWAYS GETTING PICKED ON BY UH OTHER DOG NAMED FANG br
WHO WOULD ALWAYS UM BARK WHICH WOULD ALWAYS MEAN SOMETHING LIKE br UM I'M FASTER THAN YOU OR GET OFF GET AWAY FROM ME
OR I'M GOING TO PICK ON YOU CAUSE YOU HAVE A BAD LEG
br BECAUSE HE WOULD ALWAYS BITE UM RACER'S LEG TO MAKE HIM SLOW
br AND THEN ONE DAY HIS OWNERS UM TOOK HIM TO THE VET TO GET IT br CHECKED AND THEY GAVE HIM SURGERY
AND THEN ONE TIME HE WENT BACK TO THE PARK AND HE HIS SINCE HIS LEG WAS HEALED UM
br HIS UM FANG DIDN'T KNOW THAT HIS LEG WAS HEALED AND SO HE STARTED TO RUN AFTER HIM AND EVENTUALLY HE CAUGHT UP AND KNOCKED HIM DOWN
br AND THEN HE STARTED SAYING DON'T EVER PICK ON ME ANYMORE br

SIL
THE SLOWEST T TURTLE
EVERY FOUR YEARS TURTLES FROM ALL OVER THE LAND WOULD CRAWL TO THE GREAT POND
IT WOULD TAKE SOME TURTLES FROM FAR AWAY VILLAGE TWO TWO WHOLE WEEKS JUST TO GET THERE
WHEN ALL THE TURTLES ARRIVED THERE W WAS A SEVEN DAY FESTIVAL CALLED THE SHELL DWELLERS FESTIVAL
br WHERE THERE THERE WAS LOTS OF E EATING AND LAUGHING
TURTLES COULD CATCH UP WITH FRIENDS THEY HAD NOT SEEN SINCE THE LAST FESTIVAL
EVERYTHING ABOUT THE FESTIVAL WAS FUN BUT THE MAIN EVENT WAS THE GREAT TURTLE RACE
ga THE WINNER OF THE GREAT TURTLE RACE WAS SO IMPORTANT THAT HE OR SHE DIDN'T HAVE TO MOVE FOR FOUR YEARS UNTIL THE NEXT FESTIVAL
THE THE LEAST A TURTLE MOVES THE BIGGER THEY GET AND THE LONGER THEY LIVE
br SO YOU SO YOU CAN SEE WINNING THE GREAT RACE IS A GREAT HONOR
br THE TURTLE CUP WAS THE TROPHY THAT THE WINNER WOULD TAKE HOME TO THEIR VILLAGE
IT HAD BEEN IN SLUDGE POND FOR OVER FIFTY YEARS BECAUSE NO ONE COULD EVER BEAT THEIR TURTLE
THIS WAS THE MOST FAMOUS TURTLE THERE WAS
HE WAS THE BIGGEST MOST RESPECTED AND ALSO ONE OF THE TRICKIEST TURTLES THERE WAS
THERE WERE THERE WERE MANY LEGENDS ABOUT HIM
IT WAS RUMORED HE WAS SO SLOW HIS HEART WOULD ONLY BEAT ONCE A DAY
WHEN MUD WAS IN HIS PRIME THERE WAS A NEW TURTLE BORN IN BLUE POND
THE TURTLE'S NAME SWISH
WHEN SWISH WAS BORN EVERYONE THOUGHT HE WAS A SLOW T LITTLE SLOW
BUT AS HE GOT A LITTLE OLDER THE TURTLES BEGAN TO REALIZE THAT SWISH WAS REALLY REALLY REALLY SLOW
br ONCE HIS MOTHER CALLED HIM IN FOR DINNER AND HE T AND DIDN'T MAKE IT HOME UNTIL BREAKFAST THE NEXT MORNING AND HE WAS ONLY A FOOT AWAY
br BLUE POND WAS A NICE VILLAGE LOCATED ABOUT THREE DAYS CRAWL FROM THE GREAT POND
THEY ALL FELT A LITTLE SAD BECAUSE THEY HADN'T HELD THE TURTLE CUP IN OVER A SEVEN HUNDRED YEARS
SO WITH SWISH THEY THOUGHT MAYBE JUST MAYBE HE COULD BRING BACK THE TURTLE CUP TO THEIR THEIR LITTLE POND
EVERYONE TREATED SWISH DIFFERENTLY
FOR EXAMPLE MISTER PEEKS THE LOCAL SHELL CLEANER WOULD SAY HEY THERE SWISH DO YOU WANT A FREE SHELL WAXING TODAY
WE ALL WANT YOU TO LOOK GOOD WHEN YOU BRING HOME THE CUP
MRS SNAPPER WOULD SAY HI HI SWISHY DO YOU WANT SOME YUMMY PIE TO FILL YOU UP AND S AND SLOW YOU DOWN FOR THE BIG RACE A FAT TURTLE IS A SLOW TURTLE
MISTER PEEKS WOULD NEVER DO ANYTHING FOR FREE BUT HE WAS G GOING TO GIVE SWISH A FREE SHELL WAXING
THIS WAS THE KIND OF THING THAT SWISH WOULD GET ALL THE TIME
ALL THE EXTRA ATTENTION MADE SWISH VERY UNCOMFORTABLE
HE THOUGHT SURE THEY ARE NICE TO ME BUT BECAUSE THEY THINK I CAN WIN THE RACE BUT IF I LOSE THEY'LL BE DISAPPOINTED AND MAD AT ME
I WOULD NEVER PROMISED THAT I WOULD WIN THE RACE I CAN'T BEAT MUD ANYWAY
I HEARD ONCE IT TOOK HIM THREE DAYS JUST TO YAWN
SO ONE DAY HE TOLD HIS PARENTS I DON'T WANT TO RACE
ALL THE TURTLES IN BLUE POND HELD A MEETING TO D TO DISCUSS THE PROBLEM
THE MAYOR DOCTOR SOFTSHELL SAID THIS IS RIDICULOUS SWISH HAS TO RACE HE'S THE SLOWEST TURTLE I'VE EVERY SEEN EXCEPT FOR MUD OF COURSE
WITHOUT HIM WE DON'T HAVE A CHANCE
BUT HE DOESN'T WANT TO BE TREATED SPECIAL HE JUST WANTS TO BE NORMAL AND HE DOESN'T WANT EVERYBODY TO HATE HIM IF HE CAN'T BEAT MUD
YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT EVEN THOUGH HE'S GIFTED AT BEING SLOW HE'S STILL VERY YOUNG SAID SWISH SWISH FATHER
WE NEVER THOUGHT OF THAT THEY ALL THEY S THEY ALL SAID
THE TOWN AGREED TO TREAT SWISH LIKE A NORMAL TURTLE AND AFTER A WHILE SWISH DECIDED THAT HE WOULD BE PROUD TO RACE FOR HIS VILLAGE
WHEN THE TIME OF THE FESTIVAL DREW NEAR ALL THE TURTLES IN THE LAND STARTED TOWARD GREAT POND
SWISH HAD A HAD TO BE CARRIED ON HIS FATHER'S BACK
SINCE IT WOULD HAVE TO TAKE HIM MONTHS TO GET TO THE GREAT POND BY HIMSELF
FINALLY AFTER THE LONG JOURNEY ALL THE TURTLES ARRIVED AT GREAT POND
LOOK THERE'S YOUR COUSIN PEEK A BOO FROM BIG PUDDLES' VILLAGE SAID SWISH MOTHER SWISH MOTHER
YOU'LL YOU'LL GET TO MEET ALL SORTS OF NEW TURTLES
WISH WAS SUDDENLY VERY EXCITED
HE TOLD HIS MOTHER YOU KNOW WHAT I'M GOING TO WIN THIS RACE I KNOW IT AND ALL THESE AND ALL THESE TURTLES WILL KNOW THAT BLUE POND RULES
I'M NOT AFRAID OF STUPID MUD MUD
SWISH'S MOTHER SMILED AND SAID I KNOW THAT YOU CAN WIN SWISH BUT IT'S AN HONOR JUST TO GET TO RACE SAID SWISH MOTHER
SWISH SAW A ROCK IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FIELD AND WONDERED
HOW COME THEY DON'T MOVE THAT BIG ROCK OUT OF THE FIELD IT SEEMS TO BE EVERYONE'S WAY SAID SWISH
THAT'S NOT A ROCK SWEETIE HIS MOTHER SAID THAT'S MUD
br SWISH MADE A LOUD GULP SOUND JUST DO YOUR BEST SAID HIS MOTH MOM
SWISHES FATHER SAID SON I HAVE SOMETHING TO TELL YOU
AS YOU KNOW YOUR GREAT GREAT GRAND TURTLE RACED MUD ONCE HE WASN'T AS SLOW AS YOU BUT HE DID TEACH ME ABOUT MUD'S DIRTY TRICKS
THEN HE WHISPERED IN SWISH'S EAR ALL THE TRICKS THAT HIS GREAT GREAT GRAND TURTLE TAUGHT HIM
AFTER SEVEN DAYS OF PLAYING AND DANCING AND BUG EATING FINALLY THE DAY OF THE RACE CAME
THE MAYOR OF GREAT POND MRS TORT POSTED THE RULES OF THE RACE ON A TREE FOR EVERYONE TO SEE
THEY READ RULE NUMBER ONE THE GREAT RACE BEGINS AT SUNRISE AND ENDS AT SUNSET
RULE NUMBER TWO ALL TURTLES MUST RUN AS FAST AS THEY CAN AND THE TURTLES THAT THAT IS CLOSEST TO THE STARTING LINE WINS
RULE NUMBER THREE NO TURTLE MAY PRETEND TO BE GOING FAST BUT GO SLOW INSTEAD ALL TURTLE MUST GO AS FAST AS THEY CAN AT ALL TIMES
SINCE TURTLES NEVER CHEAT THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT RULE TO BREAK THIS RULE WOULD MEAN AN END TO THE GREAT TURTLE RACE FOREVER
RULE NUMBER FOUR DO NO TURTLE MAY FALL ASLEEP SINCE IF YOU ARE ASLEEP YOU AREN'T RUNNING AS FAST AS YOU CAN
SWISH READ THE R RULES EVEN THOUGH HE KNEW THEM BY HEART THEN HE HEARD THE MAYOR SAY RUNNER'S TAKE PLEASE TAKE YOUR POSITIONS
br THE SLOWEST TURTLES FROM EACH POND WERE CARRIED TO THE STARTING LINE BY MEMBERS OF THEIR VILLAGE
THERE WERE ABOUT THREE HUNDRED TURTLES RACING THEY WERE ALL THE S ALL THE SLOWEST OF THE SLOW
THE TURTLES ALL STRETCHED AND THOUGHT REALLY THOUGHT REALLY SLOW THOUGHTS
AS THEY DID THIS AS THEY DID THE SKY TURNED FROM BLACK TO DARK BLUE
THEY LOOKED AT THE HORIZON AND SAW THE SUN WAS STARTING UHM STARTING THE RISE
JUST THEN THE MAYOR SAID READY SET SLOW AND OFF THEY WENT
ALL THE TURTLES WERE VERY VERY SLOW SO IT TOOK THEM TIME BEFORE ANYONE COULD FIGURE OUT WHICH TURTLE WERE THE SLOWEST
AFTER A FEW HOURS MOST OF THE TURTLES HAVE OR HAD GONE A FEW FEET ALL EXCEPT TWO
SWISH AND MUD WERE BOTH BACK AT THE STARTING LINE
IT LOOKED AS IF NEITHER OF THEM HAD MOVED AT ALL THEY WERE BOTH MOVING OF COURSE BUT THEY WERE SO SLOW THAT IT WAS HARD TO TELL
AFTER SIX HOURS MUD AND SWISH WERE STILL TI TI TIED AND HAD ONLY MOVED A FEW INCHES
BY NOW ALL THE TURTLES WERE USUALLY WAY AHEAD OF MUD BUT THIS TIME SWISH WAS JUST AS SLOW
MUD KNEW THAT THIS WOULD BE HIS CLOSEST RACE EVER AND HE WAS ACTUALLY GETTING A LITTLE BIT SCARED
WHO WAS THIS WHO IS THIS YOUNG PUNK HE THOUGHT TO HIMSELF
MUD SAID TO SWISH THERE'S NO WAY THAT A TURTLE AS YOUNG AS YOU CAN BE SO SLOW
EVEN I WAS FASTER THAN YOU WHEN I WAS YOUR AGE YOU'RE CHEATING YOU'RE GOING TO RUIN THE GREAT RACE FOREVER
BUT SWISH D DIDN'T LET MUD SCARE HIM
YOU'RE JUST TRYING TO TO MAKE ME QUIT I'M NOT GOING TO FALL FOR YOUR TRICKS HE SAID
TURTLES NEVER CHEAT AND I'M A TURTLE WITH HONOR
THEN MUD TRIED ANOTHER TRICK HE STARTED SINGING A SOFT BEAUTIFUL LULLABY
SWISH STARTED YAWNING
br HE WAS TIRED FROM RACING AND THOUGHT HE IT WOULD BE NICE TO JUST LISTEN TO MUD'S SWEET VOICE AND FALL ASLEEP
THEN HE SNAPPED OUT OF IT AND REMEMBERED HIS FATHERS FATHER HAD WARNED HIM OF HIS TRICKS
HE REACHED HIS SHELL AND PULLED OUT A COUPLE OF EARPLUGS
HE PUT THE EARPLUGS IN HIS EARS AND HE COULD HEAR MUD'S SINGING ANY HE COULDN'T HEAR MUD SINGING ANYMORE
MUD KEPT SINGING HIS LULLABY FOR A FEW HOURS BUT HE STOPPED RIGHT BEFORE SUNSET
THE CROWD THOUGHT HE HAD HE MUST HAVE REALIZED THAT HIS SINGING TRICK WASN'T WORKING
BUT THEN RIGHT AT THE END RIGHT BEFORE THE SUNSET SWISH STARTED TO PULL AHEAD OF MUD
OH NO SHOUTED THE FANS MUD'S WINNING IT LOOKS LIKE MUD IS STILL THE GREATEST TURTLE OF THEM ALL
THEN THE SUN WENT DOWN MUD WAS THE CLOSEST TURTLE TO THE STARTING LINE
SWISH WAS SAD THAT HE LOST BUT ALL THE TURTLES FROM BLUE POND CHEERED FOR SWISH
THEY WERE VERY PROUD HE GAVE MUD SUCH A CLOSE RACE
SWISH WAS H WAS HAPPY TOO BUT DEEP DOWN INSIDE HE KNEW HE WAS JUST AS SLOW AS MUD
THE MAYOR OF PONDLAND WENT TO PRESENT THE TURTLE CUP TO SLUDGE POND AGAIN
SHE ANNOUNCED WELL MUD IT LOOKS LIKE YOU'VE DONE IT AGAIN SLUDGE POND WINS THE TURTLE CUP AGAIN
THIS TIME IT WAS A BIT CLOSER THAN YOU WOULD HAVE LIKED I'LL BET
WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO SAY TO ALL THE TURTLES AT THE FESTIVAL
THE CROWD STARTED YELLING SPEECH SPEECH
br MUD DIDN'T ANSWER THE MAYOR TAPPED MUD ON THE SHELL AND SAID HELLO HELLO MUD
MUD DIDN'T ANSWER IN FACT MUD WAS SOUND ASLEEP
MUD HAD ACTUALLY SUNG HIMSELF TO SLEEP
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN SHE SAID MUD MUD FROM SLUDGE POND HAS BEEN DISQUALIFIED FOR SLEEPING DURING THE RACE
THIS MEANS THAT WE HAVE A NEWS CHAMPION
THE REAL WINNER IS SWISH SOFTBELLY OF BLUE POND THE CROWD WENT WILD
MRS TORT WENT UP TO SWISH AND GAVE HIM THE TURTLE CUP
SHE SAID SWISH YOU ARE THE YOUNGEST WINNER OF THE GREAT TURTLE RACE THAT WAS THE MOST EXCITING FINISH WE'VE EVER HAD
I THINK THAT YOU'LL BE THE GREATEST CHAMPION FOR MANY YEARS SINCE TURTLES ONLY GET SLOWER WITH AGE
FOR THE FIRST TIME IN SIX HUNDRED YEARS I WOULD LIKE TO PRESENT THE TURTLE CUP TO BLUE POND THE CROWD WENT WILD AGAIN
SWISH TOOK THE CUP THAT D CUP THAT DAY FOR THE FIRST TIME
HE HE WOULD TAKE IT MANY MORE TIMES AFTER THAT
IT WAS BECAUSE OF SWISH THAT BLUE POND BECAME THE MOST RESPECTED POND IN THE LAND
HE WOULD NEVER LOSE THE TURTLE CUP FOR THE REST OF HIS LIFE
br BUT THOUGH HE BECAME THE GREATEST AND THE BIGGEST TURTLE ALL MUCH GREATER OR BIGGER THAN MUD
HE ALWAYS THOUGHT SURE THAT NO ONE TREATED HIM SPECIAL AND THAT HE TREATED EVERYBODY LIKE HE WANTED TO BE TREATED

SWISH'S MOM SMILED AND SAID I KNOW THAT YOU CAN WIN SWISH BUT IT'S AN HONOR JUST TO GET TO THE RACE SAID SWISH'S MOM
br S SWISH SAW A ROCK IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FIELD AND WONDERED HOW COME THEY DON'T MOVE ALL MOVE THAT BIG ROCK OUT OF THE FIELD IT SEEMS TO BE IN EVERYONE'S WAY SWISH SAID
THAT'S NOT A ROCK SWEETIE SAID HIS MOM THAT'S MUD SWISH MADE A LOUD GULP SOUND JUST DO YOUR BEST HIS MOM SAID
SWISHES FATHER SAID SON I HAVE SOMETHING TO TELL YOU AS YOU KNOW YOUR GREAT GREAT GRAND TURTLE RACED MUD ONCE HE WASN'T AS SLOW AS YOU BUT HE DID TEACH ME L ABOUT MUD'S DIRTY TRICKS
SIL
THEN HE WHISPERED IN SWISH'S EAR ALL THE TRICKS THAT HIS GREAT GREAT GRAND TURTLE TAUGHT HIM
SIL
AFTER SEVEN DAYS OF PLAYING AND DANCING A BUG EATING FINALLY THE DAY OF THE RACE CAME THE MAYOR OF GREAT POND MRS TORT P POSTED THE RULES OF THE RACE ON A TREE FROM FOR EVERYONE TO SEE
THEY READ RULE NUMBER ONE THE GREAT RACE BEGINS AT SUNRISE AND ENDS AT SUNSET
RULE NUMBER TWO ALL TURTLES MUST RUN AS FAST AS THEY CAN ALL AND THE TURTLE THAT IS CLOSEST TO THE STARTING LINE WINS
RULE NUMBER THREE NO TURTLE MAY PRETEND TO BE GOING FAST BUT GO SLOW INSTEAD ALL TURTLES MUST GO AS FAST AS THEY CAN AT ALL TIMES
SINCE TURTLES NEVER CHEAT THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT RULE TO BREAK THIS RULE WOULD MEAN AN END TO THE GREAT TURTLE RACE FOREVER
RULE NUMBER FOUR NO TURTLE MAY FALL ASLEEP SINCE SINCE IF YOU ARE ASLEEP YOU AREN'T RUNNING AS FAST AS YOU CAN
SWISH READ THE RULES EV EVEN THOUGHT HE KNEW THEM BY HEART THEN HE HEARD THE MAYOR SAY RUNNER'S PLEASE TAKE YOUR POSITIONS ga
THE SLOWEST TURTLES FROM EACH POND WERE CARRIED TO THE STARTING LINE BY MEMBERS OF THEIR VILLAGE
THERE WERE ABOUT THREE HUNDRED TURTLE RACING THREE HUNDRED TURTLES RACING
AFTER A FEW MORE HOURS MOST OF THE TURTLES HAD GONE A FEW FEET ALL EXCEPT TWO SWISH AND MUD WERE BOTH BACK AT THE STARTING LINE
IT LOOKED AS IF NEITHER OF THEM HAD MOVED AT ALL THEY WERE BOTH MOVING OF COURSE BUT THEY WERE SO SLOW THAT IT WAS HARD TO TELL AFTER SIX HOURS MUD AND SWISH WERE STILL TIED TIED AND HAD ONLY MOVED A FEW INCHES
BUT NOW ALL THE TURTLES WERE USUALLY WAY AHEAD OF MUD BUT THIS TIME SWISH SWISH WAS JUST AS SLOW
MUD KNEW THAT THIS WOULD BE HIS CLOSEST RACE EVER AND HE WAS ACTUALLY GETTING A LITTLE BIT SCARED
WHO IS THIS YOUNG PUNK HE THOUGHT TO HIMSELF
MUD SAID TO MUD SAID TO SWISH THERE'S NO WAY THAT A TURTLE AS YOUNG AS YOU CAN BE SO SLOW EVEN IF WAS FASTER THAN YOU WHEN I WAS YOUR AGE YOU'RE CHEATING YOU'RE GOING TO RUIN THE GREAT RACE FOREVER
BUT SWISH WOULDN'T LET MUD SCARE HIM YOU'RE JUST TRYING TO MAKE ME QUIT AND I'M NOT GOING TO FALL FOR YOUR TRICKS HE SAID TURTLES NEVER CHEAT AND I'M A TURTLE WITH HONOR
THEN MUD TRIED ANOTHER TRICK HE STARTED SINGING A SOFT BEAUTIFUL LULLABY WHICH STARTED SWISH STARTED YAWNING
ga HE WAS TIRED FROM RACING AND THOUGHT THAT IT WOULD BE NICE TO JUST LISTEN TO MUD'S SWEET VOICE AND FALL ASLEEP
THEN HE SNAPPED OUT OF IT AND REMEMBERED HIS FATHER HAD WARNED HIM OF THIS TRICK HE REACHED IN HIS SHELL AND PULLED OUT A COUPLE OF EARPLUGS
HE PUT THE EARPLUGS IN HIS EARS AND COULDN'T HEAR MUD SINGING ANYMORE
THE CROWD THOUGHT HE MUST HAVE REALIZED THAT HIS SINGING TRICK WASN'T WORKING BUT THEY ALL BUT THEN RIGHT AT THE END RIGHT BEFORE THE SUNSET SWISH STARTED TO PULL AHEAD OF MUD
OH NO SHOUTED THE FANS MUD'S WINNING IT LOOKS LIKE MUD IS STILL GETTING IS STILL THE GREATEST TURTLE OF THEM ALL AND WHEN THE SUN WENT DOWN MUD WAS THE CLOSEST TURTLE TO THE STARTING LINE ga THE STARTING LINE
S SWISH WAS SAD THAT HE LOST BUT ALL THE TURTLES FROM BLUE POND CHEERED FOR SWISH
BUT THEY WERE VERY PROUD HE GAVE MUD SUCH A CLOSE RACE SWISH WAS HAPPY TOO BUT DEEP DOWN INSIDE HE KNEW HE WAS JUST AS SLOW AS MUD
THE MAYOR OF PONDLAND WENT TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE TURTLE CUP TO SLUDGE POND AGAIN
HE ANNOUNCED WELL WELL MUD IT LOOKS LIKE YOU'VE DONE IT SLUDGE POND WINS THE TURTLE CUP AGAIN
THIS TIME IT WAS A BIT CLOSER THAN YOU WOULD HAVE LIKED I BET
SIL
AND THAT WOULD
SIL
WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO SAY TO ALL THE TURTLES AT THE FESTIVAL THE CROWD STARTED YELLING SPEECH SPEECH
MUD DIDN'T ANSWER THE MAYOR TAPPED MUD ON THE SHELL AND SAID HELLO HELLO MUD
SIL
MUD STILL DIDN'T ANSWER IN FACT MUD WAS SOUND ASLEEP
MUD HAD ACTUALLY SUNG HIMSELF TO SLEEP LADIES AND GENTLEMEN SHE SAID MUD FROM SLUDGE POND HAS BEEN DISQUALIFIED FOR SLEEPING DURING THE RACE
THIS MEANS THAT WE HAVE A NEW CHAMPION THE REAL WINNER IS SWISH SOFTBELLY FROM BLUE POND THE CROWD WENT WILD
MRS TORT WENT UP TO SWISH AND GAVE HIM THE TURTLE CUP SHE SAID SWISH YOU ARE THE YOUNGEST WINNER OF THE GREAT TURTLE RACE THIS WAS THE MOST EXCITING FINISH WE'VE EVER HAD I THINK THAT YOU'LL BE A GREAT CHAMPION FOR MANY YEARS SINCE TURTLES ARE ONLY ONLY GET SLOWER WITH AGE
FOR THE FIRST TIME IN SIX HUNDRED YEARS I WOULD LIKE TO PRESENT THE TURTLE CUP TO BLUE POND THE CROWD WENT WILD AGAIN
SWISH TOOK UP THE C TOOK THE CUP THAT DAY FOR THE FIRST TIME
HE WOULD TAKE IT MANY MORE TIMES AFTER THAT
IT WAS BECAUSE OF SWISH THAT BLUE POND BECAME THE MOST RESPECTED POND IN THE LAND
HE WOULD NEVER LOSE THE TURTLE CUP FOR THE REST OF HIS LONG LIFE
BUT THROUGH BUT THOUGH HE CAME TO THE GREATEST AND BIGGEST TURTLE OF ALL TIME MUCH GREATER OR BIGGER THAN MUD HE ALWAYS MADE SURE THAT NO ONE TREATED HIM SPECIAL AND THAT HE TREATED LI EVERYBODY LIKE HE WANTED TO BE TREATED LIKE A TURTLE WITH HONOR
UHM IT WAS ABOUT A TURTLE WHO WAS VERY VERY VERY SLOW AND UHM HE WENT TO THIS GREAT TURTLE RACE
ga AND HE UHM WELL YOU SEE THERE WAS THIS OTHER GUY TURTLE NAMED MUD
AND HE HAD ALWAYS WIN WON THE TURTLE CUP RACE CAUSE HE WAS THE SLOWEST TURTLE
AND UHM br AND BUT UHM SO THEY RACED AND UHM IT TOOK THEM LIKE A DAY TO FINISH THE RACE
UHM IT TUR UHM MUD WAS UHM WELL YOU SEE ALL THE OTHER TURTLES GOT CLOSER TO THE FINISH BUT UHM MUD AND SWISH WERE STILL AT THE BACK
AND SO THEY WERE WINNING CAUSE ITS A SLOW RACE THE SLOWEST PERSON WINS
AND
SIL
THEN UHM AS A TRICK MUD STARTED SINGING A LULLABY
SO UHM SWISH WOULD FALL ASLEEP AND IT'S ONE OF THE RULES THAT YOU CAN'T FALL ASLEEP DURING THE RACE CAUSE YOU'LL GO SLOWER
AND IT'S IN ALSO IN A RULE THAT YOU HAVE TO GO FAST AS YOU CAN AND SO IF YOU WERE ASLEEP YOU WOULDN'T BE GOING AS FAST AS YOU CAN
SIL
AND SO
SIL
BUT SWISH OUTSMARTED THE TRICK AND PUT ON SOME EARPHONES EARMUFFS
UHM AND IT
SIL
LATER ON IN THE RACE SWISH GOT AHEAD SO THAT MEANT MUD WAS WINNING
SIL
AND AT THE END OF THE RACE IT TURNED OUT MUD WON BUT UHM MUD HAD SUNG HIMSELF TO SLEEP BY THE LULLABY
AND SO HE HE WAS ASLEEP AND THAT'S A RULE THAT YOU CAN'T BE ASLEEP AND SO IT TURNED OUT THAT SWISH WON AND OH AND EVERYONE WAS VERY HAPPY FOR HIM

I BEG YOUR PARDON PARDON SAID THE LEARNED MAN IT IS AN OLD HABIT WITH ME
SHE THOUGHT SAW THAT SHE WAS ON THE GRASS AND HAD BROKEN WHEEL BESIDE HER

SIL
CAN I LOOK AT IT THIS IS ABOUT A BOY NAMED DANNY WHO IS GROUNDED UHM BECAUSE HE SHAVED HIS SISTER'S CAT AND
SIL
HE COMES UP WITH EXCUSES
LIKE HOW HE WANTS TO BE A BARBER AND SO HE WAS AFRAID THAT HIS PARENTS WOULDN'T LET HIM SHAVE HIS OWN HEAD
SO HE DECIDED TO SHAVE THE CAT INSTEAD
SIL
HE ALSO CAME UP WITH EXCUSES THAT THE TEACHER MADE HIM SHAVE HIS CAT UHM FOR SCIENCE
SIL
HE THOUGHT THAT HE COULD MAKE A WIG OUT OF THE CAT'S FUR SO THAT HE COULD BUY HIS SISTER BRACES AND THEN BECAUSE SHE HAS REALLY BAD TEETH THAT'S WHAT HE SAYS
SIL
HE SAYS THAT UH HE SH SAVED IT HE SH SHAVED THE CAT TO GET RID OF HIS FUR BECAUSE HIS DAD C ALWAYS IS SNEEZING AROUND IT AND THE MOM HATES IT WHEN HE SNEEZES SO HE THOUGHT THAT IT WOULD BE BETTER
SIL
THEN HE SAYS THAT IT WAS JUST BY ACCIDENT THAT HE SHAVED THE CAT THAT HE DIDN'T MEAN TO
THAT THE NOSE CLIPPERS TURNED ON AND THE CAT RAN THROUGH IT AND SHAVED ITSELF
SIL
HE ALSO SAYS THAT CAT'S FUR GETS HARDER AND THICKER EVERYTIME THAT YOU SHAVE IT AND DARKER AND SO IT COULD MAKE UH ARMOR OUT OF ITS OWN FUR
AND THEN IT COULD BE ON TV AND THEN THEY WOULD GET LOTS OF MONEY
SIL
SO THAT THEY COULD SEND HIS SISTER TO COLLEGE
SIL
AND THEN HE SAYS THAT IT WAS SISTERS FAULT
EVEN THOUGH THEY ALWAYS SAY THAT SHE'S SO RESPONSIBLE SHE DIDN'T BRUSH HER TEETH LAST NIGHT SO SO SHE ISN'T ACTUALLY AS RESPONSIBLE AS THEY THOUGHT AND THAT IT'S ALL HER FAULT THAT THE CAT GOT SHAVED
