I ASKED MOM AND DAD FOR A BROTHER OR SISTER I WANT SOMEONE TO PLAY WITH
I TOLD THEM THEY BOUGHT LUIS
HOME FROM THE HOSPITAL HE WAS JUST A BABY HE COULDN'T DO ANYTHING
CAN WE TRADE HIM IN
I ASKED OF COURSE WE CAN'T TRADE HIM IN HE IS YOUR
HE IS YOUR BROTHER THEY SAID
NOW LUIS IS SIX MONTHS OLD HE CA
HE CAN'T DO MUCH HE'S NOT MUCH FUN
MY CAT HAD KITTENS THE KITTENS CAN RUN JUMP AND CLIMB THEY ARE LOTS OF FUN THEY ARE ONLY THREE MONTHS OLD THEY ARE YOUNGER THAN LUIS
ALL LUIS DOES IS SLEEP
WELL SOMETIMES HE CRIES HE
HE EATS A LOT TOO
HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE A BABY TO GROW I ASKED
THE KITTENS ARE Y LONG ARE YOUNGER THAN LUIS THEY CAN'T DO MANY THINGS LUIS HAS A PROBLEM
HE CAN'T DO ANYTHING
LOOK AT YOUR KITTENS
MOM SAID
THEY ARE ALMOST AS BIG AS THEIR MOTHER BUT PEOPLE TAKE LONGER TO GROW THAN KITTENS DO
SOON LUIS WILL BE ABLE TO DO THINGS SOON HE WILL BE MORE FUN
MOM TOOK SOME PICTURE FROM A BOX SOME PICTURES FROM A BOX
THEY WERE BABY PICTURES
MOM SAID ONCE YOU WERE AS SMALL AS LUIS SEE HOW MUCH YOU HAVE GROWN IN SIX YEARS
THEN LUIS STARTED TO CRY
LUNCH TIME SAID MOM YOU AND LUIS NEED LOTS OF GOOD FOOD
THAT GAVE ME AN IDEA
MAYBE LUIS WASN'T GROWING FAST BECAUSE HE DIDN'T EAT THE RIGHT FOOD KITTENS IN
EAT KITTEN FOOD THEY GROW VERY FAST
MAYBE IF MOM FED LUIS KITTEN FOOD HE'D GROW FAST
TOO
MOM DIDN'T LIKE THAT IDEA KITTEN FOOD IS FOR KITTENS SHE TOLD ME YOU AND LUI
YOU AND LUIS NEED
PEOPLE
FOOD TO GROW
YOU NEED
FOOD
FROM EACH OF THE FOUR FOOD GROUPS WHAT ARE THE FOUR FOOD GROUPS MOM I ASKED ONE GROUP IS DAIRY FOODS LIKE MILK AND CHEESE A SECOND GROUP IS MEATS LIKE CHICKEN AND FISH
EGGS AND NUTS ARE IN THE MEAT GROUP
TOO A THIRD GROUP IS BREAD
BREADS AND CEREALS THE FOURTH GROUP IS FRUITS AND VEGETABLES
I THOUGHT ABOUT
THE PROBLEM WITH LUIS LUIS MAYBE HE DID NOT EAT ENOUGH HE COULD NEVER GROW JUST EATING BABY FOOD
LUIS SHOULD EAT SOME THE SAME FOODS THAT I EAT MAYBE HE WOULD GROW
FASTER
I SAID HE CAN'T EAT THE FOOD YOU EAT MOM SAID HE ONLY HAS TWO TEETH HE CAN'T CHEW WELL I DIDN'T THINK OF THAT LUIS HAS ONLY
TWO
TEETH IT CAN'T BE FUN BEING A BABY EVEN FOR LUIS I ALL THE THINGS THAT MAKE ME GROW
I LIKE THE FOODS I EAT MAYBE THE PROBLEM WITH LUIS IS THAT HE'S A BABY HE CAN'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT SOON HE'LL GROW THEN HE'LL BE A REAL
A REAL KID JUST LIKE ME UNTIL THEN I'LL PLAY WITH THE KITTENS
RIGHT NOW
LUIS WI AH UHM
WHAT'S THAT BOYS NAME
THE BROTHER WANTED A BR
A BROTHER OR A SISTER SO HE GOT
A BROTHER
BUT HE WAS A BABY AND
AND HE WASN'T MUCH FUN BECAUSE HE'D DO HE COULDN'T DO MUCH ALL HE'D COULD DO WAS SLEEP EAT AND CRY
HE BROTHER WASN'T VERY HAPPY ABOUT THAT
HE THOUGHT THAT LUIS WASN'T
GROWING FAST BECAUSE HE WASN'T EATING THE RIGHT FOOD
HIS HE THOUGHT THAT KITTENS
GROWTH WAS
NORMAL FOR
FOR EVERY SPECIES
BUT IT WASN'T
YOU CAN COME
HUNT WITH ME TODAY SAID FATHER FOX TO HIS SON YOU ARE READY TO FIND YOUR OWN FOOD THANK YOU FATHER SAID THE SON HIS NAME WAS RAY AND HE THOUGHT HE WAS VERY SMART
BUT I THINK I CAN GO BY MYSELF NO RAY YOU ARE NOT GROWN UP YET I HAVE TO TEACH YOU FIRST DO NOT GO WITHOUT ME SAID FATHER FOX

UHM
SIL
I FORGOT WHAT SHE HAD TO FIND
UHM STEAM
SIL
AND I FORGOT THE OTHER TWO
THE RID RIDDLES OF AUNT RED WING
SO DO I READ WHO IT'S BY
CASSIE LOOKED AT
AT
CASSIE LOOKED AT THE POSTCARD IT HAD NO
POSTMARK
OR STAMP
BECAUSE IT HAD COME IN A LETTER
TO HER MOM MOTHER
IT WAS FROM AUNT RED
AUNT RED WING AN AUNT RED WING
EVER SINCE AUNT RED WING HAD BEGUN TO TRAVEL
SHE HAD PUT
POSTCARDS FOR CASSIE IN MOTHER'S LETTERS
AUNT RED WING TOOK PEOPLE ON TRIPS ALL OVER THE WORLD
THE POSTCARDS SHE WENT
SHE SHE SENT CASSIE ALWAYS HAD A RIDDLE
ABOUT
WHERE SHE SH WHERE SHE WAS
THIS POSTCARD
READ
CASSIE STUDIED THE RIDDLE
I WONDER HOW THE LENGTH OF SHADOWS CAN TELL WHERE
AUNT RED WING IS
I THINK I'LL ASK MATT
CASSIE THOUGHT
HER BROTHER MATT
WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL
HE WORKED AFTER SCHOOL
AT THE PUBLIC LIBRARY
CASSIE LIKED TO VISIT HIM THERE
AS HE AS SHE WALKED THE LIBRARY
CA CA LIBRARY CASSIE READ
THE RIDDLE
OVER
OVER AND OVER AGAIN
NOON SHADOWS ARE LONG
THE SUN
SETS SOON
WHERE IS IT COLD IN THE
MONTH OF JUNE
SHE HAD SOME IDEAS
BUT SHE
WANTED TO ASK MATT
A QUESTION
HI SAID MATT
WHEN CASSIE CAME TO HIS DESK
WHAT'S NEW
HI SAID CASSIE
LOOK WHAT I HAVE
OTHER POSTCARD FROM AUNT
RED WING MATT LAUGHED
THAT MEANS YOU HAVE ANOTHER RIDDLE TO FIGURE OUT
YES I DO
CASSIE SAID
SHADOWS ARE THE FIRST CLUE
TO THE RIDDLE
YOU CAN TELL THE SEASONS
BY THE LENGTH OF SHADOWS
YOU CAN YOU
CERTAINLY CAN SAID MATT
HE REACHED FOR
A LAMP ON HIS DESK
LOOK AT THE FLOOR
CA
CASSIE
WHAT DO YOU SEE
WHEN WHEN I HOLD THE LAMP
LIKE THIS
CASSIE LOOKED ON THE FLOOR I SEE A SHORT
I SEE A SHORT SHADOW
SEE
SAID
SHE SAID
BUT I DON'T SEE WHAT IT IS HA
I AT BUT I DON'T
BUT I DON'T
SEE WHAT IT HAS TO DO
TO DO WITH THE SEASONS
LET'S
PRETEND
THAT LAMP
IS THE SUN
SAID MATT
WHEN THE LIGHT SHINES FROM ABOVE THE SHADOW
IS SHORT
DURING THE SUMMER THE MOON
SUN
IS HIGH
AND SHADOWS ARE SHORTER
BUT WHEN I HOLD THE LAMP
AT THIS ANGLE
THE SHADOW GROWS LONGER
THAT'S RIGHT SAID MATT
WHEN I HOLD THE LAMP
AT THE ANGLE LIKE THE NOON SUN
IS
IN THE WINTER
THE SHADOWS ARE LONG
AUNT RED WING IS IN A PLACE WHERE THE NOON SHADOWS
ARE
LONG SAID CASSIE
SINCE THE NOON SUN IS LOW IN WINTER IT MUST
BE WINTER
WHERE AUNT RED WING IS
WHERE AUNT RED WING IS
CASSIE WAS PROUD OF HERSELF
THAT'S RIGHT
SAID MATT
WHAT IT WHAT
WHAT'S NEXT WHAT'S THE NEXT
CLUE
THE SECOND CLUE IS
THAT THE SUN
SUN SETS
SOON
CASSIE THOUGHT FOR A MOMENT
I KNOW
THE SUN
SETS MUCH EARLIER
IN THE WINTER
THAN IT DOES IN THE SUMMER
SO THAT ALSO
TELLS US IT'S WINTER
HERE
AUNT RED WING IS RIGHT AGAIN SAID MATT
BUT I HAVEN'T SOLVED
THE RIDDLE YET
SAID CASSIE SHE LOOKED AT THE
GLOBE
ON MATT'S DESK
ISN'T THIS
THE EQUATOR SHE ASKED
POINTING TO A LINE AROUND THE MIDDLE OF THE GLOBE
THAT'S RIGHT SAID MATT
WELL SAID CASSIE
PEOPLE WHO LIVE SOUTH OF THE EQUATOR HAVE WINTER STARTING
IN JUNE
AND SUMMER IN JANUARY
DON'T THEY DON'T THEY
THAT'S TRUE SAID MATT
IF IT
IF IT IS IF IT IS WINTER IN JUNE THEN AUNT RED WING MUST BE SOMEWHERE SOUTH OF THE
EQUATOR
CASSIE THOUGHT
SHE LOOKED CAREFULLY AT AT THE GLOBE
AUNT RED WING
COULD BE IN SOUTH AMERICA SOUTH AMERICA OR AUSTRALIA
MAYBE SHE SHE'S SOMEWHERE IN AFRICA
SAID CASSIE MAYBE THERE'S ANOTHER CLUE SAID MATT
WHAT
IS THE PICTURE ON THE CARD
IT'S SOME ANIMAL
I DIDN'T LOOK TOO
IT'S
I DIDN'T LOOK TOO CLOSELY
CASSIE TURNED THE POSTCARD OVER
SHE LAUGHED A KOALA BEAR
LOOK MATT
IT'S A KOALA BEAR
THEY LIVE ONLY IN AUSTRALIA DON'T THEY
MATT NODDED
WE WERE SO BUSY TRYING TO GUESS THE RIDDLE THAT WE NEVER EVEN LOOKED AT THE PICTURE
THAT'S RIGHT
SAID CASSIE
AUSTRALIA HAS KOALA BEARS AND
AND WINTER IN JUNE
AND LONG WINTER SHADOWS AT NOON
SAID MATT
AND AUNT RED WING
AND HER RIDDLES LAUGHED
CASSIE
SO SHOULD I TAKE THESE OFF UHM

SIL
HAD A G GAVE A LETTER TO THEM AND UHM SO THEY UH
SIL
THEY WERE UHM TRYING TO GUESS THE RIDDLES BUT AND THEY DIDN'T SEE THE PICTURE SO IT WAS HARDER FOR THEM TO GUESS IT AFTER THEY DID THE RIDDLES BECAUSE THEY KNEW DIDN'T THEY KNEW IT WAS SOUTH OF THE EQUATOR BUT THEY DIDN'T KNOW WHERE IT WAS SOUTH OF THE EQUATOR CAUSE THAT'S ALL THE CLUES TOLD THEM SO WHEN THEY SAW THE PICTURE THEY KNEW WHERE IT WAS CAUSE

WHEN MAMMA MOUSE CAME DOWN TO LOOK FOR HIM HE WAS DEAD
MAMMA MOUSE WAS SAD TO BE ALL ALONE SHE FELT THAT PEOPLE WERE MEAN TO KILL A POOR MOUSE BECAUSE HE WANTED TO GET FOOD FOR HIMSELF AND HIS FAMILY
MICE CAN'T THE EARN MONEY LIKE PEOPLE DO TO DO
THIS SO THEY HAVE TO LIVE BY STEALING FOOD MAMMA MOUSE WAS A BRAVE MOUSE AND KNEW THAT IT WAS HER JOB TO FIND FOOD FOR THEIR HER CHILDREN SO SHE DR DRIED HER EYES AND WENT TO WORK CHEWING THROUGH THE BOARD
BETWEEN THE KITCHEN AND THE WALL
IT TOOK TIME TO THIS BECAUSE SHE COULD ONLY WORK AT NIGHT MICE LIKE TO SLEEP DURING THE DAY AND WORK AT NIGHT AT PEOPLE
AT NIGHT THEY THERE ARE NO PEOPLE AROUND TO BUG THEM
AND EVEN CATS SLEEP SOME SLEEP SOME MICE RUN ABOUT IN THE DAY BUT THEY ARE NOT VERY SMART
AT LAST MAMMA MOUSE CHEWED A HOLE THROUGH THE BOARD
BIG ENOUGH FOR T FOR HER TO GET THROUGH AND TO THE KITCHEN BUT SHE WAS SAD TO FIND THE BREAD COVERED WITH A PAN
HOW MEAN PEOPLE ARE TO PUT THINGS WHERE A HUNGRY MOUSE CANNOT
GET TO THEM SAID MAMMA
MOUSE WITH A SIGH BUT JUST THEN SHE SAW A BARREL OF FLOUR ON THE FLOUR THAT MADE HER HAPPY SHE KNEW SHE COULD EASILY CHEW THROUGH THAT AND THAT COULD EAT THE FLOUR INSTEAD OF BREAD IT WAS NOT
IT WAS NOW
ALMOST MORNING MAMMA MOUSE DECIDED TO LEAVE THE ATTACK ON THE FLOUR BARREL FOR THE NEXT NIGHT SHE TOOK A FEW CRUMBS THAT WERE ON THE FLOOR
FOR HER CHILDREN AND RAN BACK INTO THE WALL UP TO HER NEST HICKORY AND DICKORY AND DOCK WERE VERY GLAD TO GET THE CRUMBS BECAUSE THEY WERE HUNGRY WHEN THEY HAD
EATEN THEY THEY ALL CURLED UP WITH THEIR MOTHER AND SLEPT ALL DAY
BE GOOD CHILDREN SAID MAMMA MOUSE THE NEXT

DON'T COME OUT OF OUR NEST TILL I COME BACK
AFTER TONIGHT WE WILL NOT BE HUNGRY FOR A LONG TIME
I WILL CHEW A HOLE AT THE
AT THE BACK OF THE FLOUR BARREL

WHERE I WILL NOT BE FOUND
SHE KISSED EACH ONE OF THEM GOOD BYE AND RAN DOWN THE WALL
WHEN THEY
WERE LEFT ALONE HICKORY WANTED TO GO TO SLEEP AGAIN BUT
LITTLE DOCK WAS WIDE AWAKE HE JUMPED AROUND IN THE NEST SO MUCH THAT HIS BROTHERS COULD NOT SLEEP
I WISHED I COULD NOT I COULD GO WITH MOTHER SOME NIGHT SAID DOCK
IT'S NO FUN TO STAY HERE ALL THE TIME SHE WILL TAKE US WHEN
WE ARE BIG ENOUGH
SAID DICKORY
WE ARE ENOUGH NOW SAID DOCK AND IF I KNEW
MY WAY I C WOULD GO OUT INTO THE WORLD AND SEE
WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE
I KNOW A WAY OUT SAID HICKORY BUT MAMMA WOULDN'T LIKE IT IF WE
WENT WITH HER WITHOUT HER
SHE DOESN'T HAVE TO KNOW SAID THE BAD DOCK
OH YES
DO SAID DICKORY WELL SAID HICKORY I'D LIKE TO TAKE A LITTLE STROLL
MYSELF
BUT YOU MUST PROMISE TO BE VERY CAREFUL AND NOT GET INTO ANY TROUBLE I'LL TAKE YOU THROUGH THE HOLE THAT I FOUND SO THE THREE LITTLE MICE STARTED OFF WITH THE HICKORY SHOWING THE WAY SOON THEY CAME TO A CRACK IN THE WALL HICKORY STUCK HIS HEAD THROUGH
HE SAW THAT ALL WAS QUIET FAMILY OF PEOPLE
THAT LIVED IN THE HOUSE
WAS FAST ASLEEP
SO HE WENT THROUGH THE CRACK AND HIS TWO
BROTHERS CAME AFTER
THEIR THEIR LITTLE HEARTS BEAT VERY FAST BECAUSE THEY KNEW
IF THEY WERE FOUND THEY WOULD HAVE TO RUN FOR THEIR LIVES
THEY CREPT OVER THE THICK CARPET UNTIL THEY CAME TO SOME STAIRS WHAT SHALL WE DO NOW HICKORY ASKED HIS BROTHERS LET'S GO DOWN SAID DOCK
SO
SO THEY WENT DOWN THE STAIRS TO THE HALL
ALL OF THE HOUSE VERY CAREFULLY
THEY WERE SURPRISED BY WHAT THEY SAW
THERE WAS A BIG WALL FOR HATS AND COATS A BUCKET OF UMBRELLAS TWO VERY PRETTY CHAIRS AND A BEST OF ALL A TALL CLOCK
THAT STOOD ON THE FLOOR
AND TICKED OUT THE MINUTES IN A LOUD AND STRONG VOICE
WHAT IS IT ASKED DICKORY
QUIETLY I DON'T KNOW SAID HICKORY HE WAS AFRAID TOO
IS IT ALIVE ASKED DOCK I DON'T KNOW SAID HICKORY AGAIN
THEN THEY SAW THAT THE CLOCK DIDN'T NOTICE THEM
BUT
KEPT TICKING AWAY SO THEY GOT THEIR COURAGE UP AND RAN ABOUT SUDDENLY DICKORY GAVE A YELL THAT MADE HIS BROTHERS COME RUNNING
THERE IS A CORNER LAY ALMOST HALF OF A MUFFIN
THE LITTLE GIRL OF THE FAMILY HAD IT WAS A GREAT
FIND FOR THE THREE MICE
THEY ATE UNTIL THE LAST CRUMB WAS GONE
AND THEY WERE FAT AND HAPPY THIS IS
BETTER THAN THE KITCHEN SAID DOCK

IF WE ONLY LOOK FOR THEM BUT THEY COULDN'T COULDN'T FIND
MORE ALL THE DOORS IN THE HALL WERE CLOSED DOCK WENT AND
TO THE CLOCK
HE FOUND NOTHING EXCEPT A HOLE
TO HIS
TO INSIDE OF THE CLOCK
AND HE STUCK HIS HEAD IN DOCK COULD HEAR THE TICKING LOUDER
THAN NEVER NOW HE LOOKED WAY UP TO THE TOP OF THE CLOCK AND SAW SOMETHING BRIGHT
HE THOUGHT IT IT MUST BE GOOD
E TO EAT
IF HE COULD ONLY GET TO IT
WITHOUT SAYING ANYTHING TO HIS BROTHERS
DOCK RAN UP THE SIDES
OF THE CLOCK UNTIL HE CAME TO THE GEARS
HE WAS JUST ABOUT TO BITE A AT A SHINY WHEEL TO SEE WHAT IT
IT WAS A ONE O'CLOCK
THE CLOCK WAS JUST TELLING THE TIME BUT THE BIG BELL WAS
JUST BESIDE DOCK'S EAR
AND THE NOISE HURT THE POOR LITTLE MOUSE HE SCREAMED WITH FEAR AND RAN
D AND RAN DOWN THE
CLOCK AS FAST AS HE COULD
GO
WHEN HE GOT TO THE HALL HE HEARD HIS BROTHERS RUNNING
UP THE STAIRS HE RAN AFTER THEM AS FAST AS
HE COULD ONLY
WHEN THEY WERE SAFE IN THEIR NEST AGAIN DID THEY STOP TO BREATHE THEY WERE SO SCARED THAT THEIR LITTLE HEARTS BEAT FAST FOR AN HOUR
MAMMA MOUSE
CAME
BACK IN THE MORNING
SHE BROUGHT SOME NICE FLOUR WITH HER FOR BREAKFAST THEY TOLD HER ABOUT THEIR ADVENTURE SHE THOUGHT
THEY
HAD BEEN PUNISHED ENOUGH ALREADY FOR
NOT LISTENING TO HER SO SHE DID NOT
SCOLD THEM
SHE ONLY SAID YOU SEE MY DEARS YOUR MOTHER IN KNEW BEST
WHEN SHE TOLD
YOU NOT
LEAVE THE NEST
CHILDREN SOMETIMES
THINK THEY KNOW
MORE THAN THEIR PARENTS THIS ADVENTURE COULD TEACH YOU ALWAYS TO LISTEN TO YOUR MOTHER
THE NEXT TIME YOU RUN AWAY
IT MAY END WORSE THAN LAST NIGHT
AFTER ALL REMEMBER WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR POOR FATHER

THEY DECIDED TO BEGIN IN
IN A LINE
AT ONE END OF THE ORCHARD AND DIG UNTIL ONE OF THEM FOUND THE MONEY
THEY DUG UNTIL THEY HAD TURNED UP THE SOIL FROM ONE END OF THE ORCHARD TO THE OTHER
THEY DUG AROUND THE TREE ROOTS AND BETWEEN THEM
BUT THEY FOUND NO POT OF GOLD
THEY THOUGHT MAYBE SOMEONE HAD STOLEN IT

THE THREE SONS WERE UPSET TO HAVE WORKED FOR NOTHING

I THERE GOES PUDDLES
WE CAN GO AFTER HIM ON OUR BIKES JEFF'S MOM LOOKED OUT THE WINDOW YES YES BUT COME BACK AND DO YOUR HOMEWORK REMEMBER YOU MUST US TURN IN YOUR IDEAS FOR THE SCIENCE FAIR PROJECT TOMORROW
THE BOYS JUMPED ON THEIR BIKES AND HEADED UP TO THE HILL
THE BOYS JUMPED
THEY SAW PUDDLES UP AHEAD
HIS GOLDEN EARS FLOPPED UP AND DOWN AS HE RAN OVER THE HILLTOP
THE BOYS PUSHED HARDER ON THE PEDALS AS THEY CLIMBED
THE STEEP HILL CHANGE YOUR GEARS MIKE YELLED JEFF HE WATCHED AS MIKE'S CHAIN SLIPPED OVER A LARGE GEAR THANKS JEFF
THAT MAKES ME PEDALING MUCH EASIER AT THE TOP OF THE HILL THE BOYS KEPT <unk> BREATH MIKE WAS PUZZLED JEFF WHY DID SHIFTING MAKE IT EASIER TO PEDAL I DON'T KNOW IT'S JUST WHEN I GOT SOMETHING TO DO WITH GEARS ANSWERED JEFF
I'M JUST GLAD THAT WE WON'T NEED TO PEDAL SO HARD TO GET DOWN THE HILL THE BOYS LOOKED D THE HILL BELOW THEY COULD SEE THE ROLLER COASTER IN THE NEW AMUSEMENT PARK
THE PARK WAS CALLED THE FUN STATION
LOOK AT THOSE HILLS
HILLS MIKE
BET WE WOULD NEED
SOME BIG GEARS TO CLIMB THEM AND STRONG LEGS TOO ADDED MIKE JEFF LOOKED DOWN AT THE FUN STATION FENCE PUDDLES WAS DIGGING UNDER THE GATE OH NO HE GROANED MOM SAID THAT THE FUN STATION WAS OFF LIMITS UNTIL
OH
OFF LIMITS UNTIL IT OPENS NEXT SUMMER THE BOYS COASTED DOWN THE HILL
AND THEN UPHILL PEDALING PAD OFF
JEFF WONDERED HOW FAST THEY COULD GO IMAGINE HOW FAST THEY COULD GO ON THE ROLLER COASTER MIKE AND IKE JEFF AND MIKE SQUEEZED THEIR HAND T BRAKES TO SLOW DOWN THEY REACHED THE FENCE THEY JEFF DROPPED TO HIS KNEES HE PEERED THROUGH THE HOLE
PUDDLES WAS NOWHERE IN SIGHT PUDDLES PUDDLES
MIKE AND JEFF SHOUTED BUT PUDDLES DID NOT RETURN
THEN OVER THE SOUNDS OF THE WORKERS THEY HEARD A FAMILY A FAMILIAR BARK FROM F FROM THE OVER OTHER SIDE OF THE FENCE A WOMAN SPOKE HAVE YOU LOST YOUR DOG YES CRIED JEFF DO YOU HAVE DO YOU HAVE PUDDLES
WELL SAID THE WOMAN I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S PUDDLES BUT IT'S A FRIENDLY COCKER SPANIEL
THAT'S PUDDLES CRIED JEFF CAN YOU MAKE HIM COME BACK THROUGH THIS HOLE THE WOMAN LAUGHED HERE I BET IT'S EASIER IF PUDDLES

HIM PUDDLES WIGGLED TO GET FREE BUT HE WAS JEFF WASN'T ABOUT TO LET HIM ESCAPE AGAIN
JEFF LOOKED UP AT THE WOMAN THANK YOU FOR BRINGING PUDDLES OUT
NO PROBLEM SAID THE YOUNG WOMAN MY NAME'S LISA I'M ONE OF THE ENGINEERS BUILDING THE GREAT GRAVITY MACHINE I I WAS PLAYING WITH PUDDLES WHEN I HEARD YOU CALL
THAT'S THE GREAT
WHAT'S THE GREAT GRAVITY MACHINE ASKED JEFF THAT'S THE NAME FOR THE ROLLER COASTER LISA POINTED TOWARD THE BIG STEEL HILLS WOW IT'S HUGE
SAID MIKE CAN SEE WHY THEY CALL IT THE
CALL IT THE GREAT
BUT WHY ABOUT GRAVITY
WELL GRAVITY IS A FORCE A FORCE THAT PUSHES
PULLS THINGS EXPLAINED LISA ON THE ROLLER COASTER CARS ATTACH TO THE CHAIN THAT WRAPS AROUND GEARS THEN THE ENGINE TURNS THE GEARS AND THE CHAINS PULLS THE CARS UP THE HILL FIRST THEM
AT THE FIRST HILL
THE HIGHEST ONE
THE FIRST HILL IS ALWAYS THE HIGHEST ONE WHEN THE CARS REACH THE TOP THE FORCE OF THE GRAVITY PULLS IT DOWN THE HILL M AND THEN WHEN THEY REACH THE BOTTOM WHEN THE CARS ARE GOING FAST ENOUGH TO GET UP THE NEXT HILL BY THEMSELVES YEAH JEFF NODDED GRAVITY IS WHY WE GO SO FAST DOWN THE HILL ON OUR BIKES THAT'S RIGHT
LISA REPLIED
YOUR BICYCLE AND
AND THE ROLLER COASTER BOTH USE GRAVITY BUT THERE IS ONE BIG DIFFERENCE
YOUR BIKE HAS PEDALS
THE ROLLER COASTER CARS HAVE NO PEDALS NO ENGINE
THE ROLLER COASTER CAR HAS SEVERAL SIMPLE MACHINES SIMPLE MACHINES HAVE ONLY TWO OR
ONE OR TWO PARTS THE SIMPLE MACHINE IS AN
WHAT'S A RA
AMP WHAT'S A RAMP A MACHINE
ASKED MIKE
SURE SAID LISA A MACHINE IS ANYTHING THAT HELPS YOU DO THINGS MORE EASILY SUPPOSE THAT YOU HAD TO CLIMB UP THE HILL STRAIGHT AND THEN THE GROUND TOP THAT ROLLER COASTER COASTS
HILL
THAT WOULD BE TOUGH SAID JACK IT'S MUCH EASIER FOR A ROLLER COASTER TO CLIMB A RAMP THAN GO STRAIGHT UP LISA EXPLAINED
MIKE HAD AN IDEA OUR BIKES
GO UP THE HILL ARE THEY MACHINES
LISA NODDED YOUR BIKE IS MADE OF SEVERAL SIMPLE MACHINES THE PEDALS HELP YOU TURN
THE WHEELS THE PEDALS ARE PART OF A SIMPLE MACHINE CALLED THE WHEEL AND THE AXLE THE HAND AND BRAKES ARE A SIMPLE MACHINE CALLED LEVELS LEVELS
HOW ABOUT THE GEARS
EARS ASKED MIKE
YOU'RE RIGHT THE GEARS ARE SIMPLE MACHINES ANSWERED LISA
THEN JUST THEN PUDDLES
FROM ON JEFF CAUGHT THE PUPPY AND CLIPPED AND CLIPPED HIS LEASH I GUESS PUDDLES THINKS IT'S TIME TO GO HOME
JEFF LAUGHED
JEFF LAUGHED
I GUESS
PUDDLES PULLED HIS LEASH
LEASH WHILE THE BOYS THANKED LISA

AS THE BOYS TURNED HOME MARK
MATT MIKE THOUGHT ABOUT HIS HOMEWORK I KNOW THAT I'M GOING TO DO FOR THE SCIENCE FAIR HE ANNOUNCED
ON
JEFF SMILED HE PLANNED TO BUILD A ROLLER COASTER OF IT'S COLLECTION YOU WOULD CALL IT THE LITTLE LITTLE GRAVITY MACHINE
WELL WHAT HAPPENED IN THE STORY IS UH

MORE THAN NINETY PERCENT OF THE HUMAN BODY IS MADE UP OF WATER
WHEN RACER THE DOG
WHEN HIS OWNERS GOT HIM AS A PUPPY ALL HE WANTED TO DO WAS RUN AND RUN SO HIS OWNERS NAMED HIM RACER
SIL
THEN WHEN HE GOT OLDER HE DEVELOPED PROBLEMS WITH HIS BACK LEGS
EVERY TIME HE RAN HE WOULD HE WOULD LIMP
BUT THAT DIDN'T STOP HIM FROM RUNNING BECAUSE LIKE MOST DOGS RACER LOVED TO RUN
THERE WAS A DOG PARK NEAR WHERE HE LIVED
HE ENJOYED PLAYING AT THE DOG PARK BECAUSE HE DIDN'T AT THE DOG PARK BECAUSE HE DIDN'T HAVE TO BE ON HIS LEASH WHEN HE WAS THERE SO HE COULD RUN AS MUCH AS HE LIKED
THERE WAS ONE DOG AT THE DOG PARK NAMED FANG
HE WOULD ALWAYS COME UP TO THE RACER TO RACER AND BITE HIS BACK LEG AND RUN AWAY SAYING BARK BARK BARK BARK
SIL
WHICH IN DOG TALK MEANS YOU ARE TOO SLOW TO CATCH ME WITH THAT LIMP OF YOURS SO I'M GOING TO PICK ON YOU
RACER WOULD ALWAYS CHASE FANG BUT HE COULD NEVER CATCH HIM
ONE DAY RACER WENT TO THE VET
RACER LIKED THE VET BECAUSE PEOPLE IN WHITE THE WHITE COATS GAVE HIM TREATS RACER DIDN'T KNOW
SIL
DIDN'T KNOW TH BUT HE BUT AT THE VET AF HE WOULD HAVE TO HAVE SURGERY TO FIX HIS LEGS
WHEN HE AWOKE UP FROM THE SURGERY HE DIDN'T EVEN REMEMBER WHERE HE WAS
SIL
BUT SOON HIS OWNERS CAME AND DROVE HIM HOME
ON THE DRIVE
SIL
HOME UM ON THE DRIVE HOME RACER REALIZED THAT HIS LEGS ITCHED VERY BADLY
I THOUGHT
SIL
HE THOUGHT OH BOY I'M GOING TO LICK MY LEG SO HARD THAT THE ITCHING IS GOING TO GO AWAY
SO HE TURNED HIS HEAD AROUND TO LICK HIS LEG BUT THERE WAS A BIG WHITE THING IN HIS WAY
HE WAS WEARING A COLLAR THAT MADE IT IMPOSSIBLE TO LICK HIS LEGS
A FEW DAYS LATER HE WENT WITH HIS OWNERS TO THE DOG PARK
RACER HAD TO BE ON A LEASH SINCE HE STILL NEEDED TO HEAL FROM HIS SURGERY
BUT IT WAS NICE TO SEE ALL HIS FRIEND
MEAN OLD FANG SAID BARK BARK BARK BARK WHICH MEANT
WHY DO YOU HAVE THAT
WHY DO YOU HAVE TO WEAR THAT STUPID LOOKING COLLAR IT SURE DOES LOOK SILLY
EVENTUALLY RACER DIDN'T HAVE TO WEAR THE COLLAR BUT THEN HIS LEGS DIDN'T ITCH SO HE DIDN'T WANT TO LICK THEM
FOR SIX WEEKS RACER WOULD TAKE LONG WALKS AND GO TO THE DOG PARK BUT STILL HE HAD TO BE ON A HIS LEASH
ONE DAY HE TOOK A WALK TO THE DOG PARK AND ALL HIS FRIENDS WERE THERE AS USUAL
THEN HIS OWNERS REACHED AROUND HIS NECK AND TOOK OFF HIS LEASH LEASH
THEN JUST THEN FANG BIT HIM ON THE BACK LEG AND RAN AWAY
RACER'S OWNERS SAID GO RUN SO RACER STARTED RUNNING AND CHASING FANG
FANG WAS LAUGHING BECAUSE HE KNEW RACER COULD NEVER CATCH HIM BUT SUDDENLY HE NOTICED THAT RACER WAS CATCHING UP
RACER WAS F RUNNING FAST RACER WAS RUNNING FASTER THAN HE COULD EVER REMEMBER AND BEFORE HE KNEW IT HE HAD CAUGHT UP TO FANG AND KNOCKED HIM DOWN
RACER SAID BARK BARK WHICH IN DOG TALK MEANT MEANS DON'T PICK ON ME ANY MORE FANG
AND FROM THAT DAY ON FANG NEVER BIT RACER'S LEGS
RACER WAS SO HAPPY THAT HE COULD RUN FAST THAT HE RAN IN CIRCLES
AND THAN RAN IN CIRCLES
FINALLY HE CAME BACK TO HIS OWNERS AND GAVE HIM GAVE THEM BIG KISSES FOR FIXING HIS LEGS
OK WELL
SHOULD I TELL LIKE ABOUT IT
WELL ONCE THERE WAS THIS THERE WAS THIS DOG WHO
WELL HE LIKED TO RUN ALOT SO HE UM
SIL
SO WHAT HE DID WAS
SIL
HE WOULD WELL THEY HAD HIS LEGS WHEN HE GREW OLDER HIS LEGS WOULD GET THEY WOULD HURT OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
SO THEN THEY UM AND THIS ONE THEY WOULD GO TO THE DOG PARK AND THEN THIS ONE DOG NAMED FANG WOULD BITE HIM ON THE LEGS AND SAY TO HIM YOU'RE SO YOU'RE LIKE YOU CAN'T RUN FAST YOU'LL NEVER CATCH TO ME AND TEASE HIM
AND THEN ONE DAY THEY TOOK HIM TO THE VET AND HE'S REAL HAPPY AND THEN UM HE DOESN'T KNOW THAT HE'S GONNA GET SURGERY
SIL
AND THEN AFTER THE SURGERY HIS LEGS ARE HURTING HIS LEGS ARE JUST ITCHY
AND THEN THEY HAVE TO PUT A COLLAR ON HIM SO HE DOESN'T LICK IT
SIL
THEN <br>
SIL
WELL THEN THEY UM WELL THEN WHEN HE GOES THEY IN SIX WEEKS HE CAN RUN AGAIN AND TAKE THEY COLLAR OFF SO THEN
SIL
NE THIS TIME HE FANG DOES THE SAME THING AND
THEN RACER CHASES AFTER HIM AND CATCHES HIM THEN KNOCKS HIM DOWN
AND THEN HE'S SO HAPPY THAT HE RUNS AROUND IN CIRCLES
AND THEN AFTER THAT THEY HE GIVES BIG KISSES TO HIS OWNERS FOR FIXING HIS LEG

SIL
THE PANDA
WHY DID A PANDA WITH A BEAUTIFUL GIRL NAME YIN YANG ER YIN YIN HAVE HER NAME CHANGED TO THE VERY UN BEAUTIFUL NAME COLUMBUS
IT WAS FRED'S IDEA SO LET'S BEGIN WITH FRED
HE DIDN'T MIND HANDLING THE RAW MEAT HE HAD TO FEED THE TO THE TIGERS HIS MAIN OBJECTION WAS TO BEING EATEN
NO ONE COULD BLAME FRED REALLY SINCE NO ONE REALLY WANTS TO BE EAT EATEN
SOME PEOPLE DO LIKE THE TO BITE THEIR FINGER NAILS BUT SINCE NO ONE REALLY WANTS TO BE EATEN
SIL
SOME PEOPLE DO LIKE TO BITE THEIR F ER
SIL
SOME PEOPLE DO LIKE TO BITE FRED WAS NO OKAY
SIL
OKAY BUT FRED WAS A NAIL NAIL BITER SO BEING EATEN WAS DEFINITELY NOT SOMETHING HE LOOKED FORWARD TO EACH AFTERNOON AT THREE O'CLOCK WHEN IT CAME TIME TO FEED THE TIGERS
FOR FRED WHEN IT CAME TO THE PANDAS HE HAD A WARM SPOT IN HIS HEART
ACTUALLY IT WAS A EIGHTY FIVE POINT FIVE DEGREE SPOT ON HIS LEFT KIDNEY BUT THE POINT IS THAT HE WAS VERY FOND OF FEEDING THE PANDAS
THERE WERE THREE PANDAS AND THEY WERE KNOWN AS THE PAN FAMILY THEY WERE IN ORDERS OF CUTENESS YIN YIN THE DAUGHTER OF POO POO THE MOTHER AND MOO MAN THE GENTLE AND ALWAYS SLEEPY FATHER
MANY PEOPLE KNOW THAT PANDAS EAT BAMBOO A LOT OF IT A LOT OF BAMBOO CAN GET QUITE HEAVY SO BECAUSE OF THE PANDAS FRED BECAME VERY STRONG AND WAS IN TERRIFIC SHAPE
BUT PHYSICAL FITNESS WAS NOT THE ONLY REASON FRED LOVED THE PANDAS THE OTHER REASON WAS THAT ANYONE WHO GETS WITHIN THREE FEET OF A PANDA PANDA AUTOMATICALLY FALLS IN LOVE WITH THEM
IT'S A LAW OF NATURE AS AT FURTHER DIS DISTANCES PANDAS HAVE A STRANGE ALMOST MAGICAL EFFECT ON HUMAN BEINGS WHICH MAKES US WANT TO HUG AND SQUEEZE THINGS FRED WAS NOT ALLOWED TO ACT ACTUALLY HUG THE PANDA BEARS SINCE THAT COULD BE DAN DANGEROUS SO ALL THE OTHER PEOPLE IN THE ZOO ER
SIL
THE ZOO WOULD KNOW THAT THE PANDAS HAD JUST BEEN FED WHEN THEY SAW FRED HUGGING THE RATHER UN CUDDLY PALM TREE OUTSIDE OF THE PANDA'S HOME
IT IS INTERESTING TO POINT OUT THAT ER AT THIS TIME THAT MORE STUFFED PANDA BEARS ARE SOLD AT ZOO GIFT SHOPS THEN ALL OF THE OTHER STUFFED ANIMALS COMBINED
THIS MUST CERTAINLY BE
SIL
THIS ALMOST CERTAINLY BE ACCOUNTED FOR BY THIS STRANGE ALMOST MAGICAL EFFECT THAT PANDAS POSSESS
BUT EVERYTHING WAS NOT ALL BAMBOOS AND HUGS AT THE ZOO ONE MORNING FRED WAS FEEDING YIN YIN ER YIN YIN AND SAID OH YIN YIN I WISH THAT MORE PEOPLE WOULD COME TO VISIT THE ZOO
I KNEW I SHOULDN'T BE TELLING YOU THIS BUT IT BUT WE MUST HAVE TO SELL YOU AND YOUR FAMILY TO THE BIG ZOO IN S SAN ANGELES
IF WE DON'T GET MORE MONEY
SIL
IT'S NOT THAT YOU AREN'T SELLING ENOUGH STUFFED PANDA BEARS IT'S JUST THAT THERE AREN'T
SIL
TH THAT THERE HAVEN'T BEEN ENOUGH PEOPLE COMING TO SEE YOU IN THE FIRST PLACE I THINK WHAT THE ZOO NEEDS IS A GREAT ADVERTISING CAMPAIGN
FRED WAS THE ST STARTING TO FEEL UNCONTROLLABLY URGE TO HUG THE PANDA SO BEFORE HE RAN OFF TO HUG THE PALM TREE QU QU
SIL
QUICKLY SAID COSTS US SO MUCH TO FEED YOU PANDA BEARS <unk> I WOULD HATE IF Y YOU HAD TO LEAVE US AFTER ALL IT'S ONLY HOME YOU KNOW BESIDES IF YOU LEAVE I'LL GET TERRIBLY OUT OF SHAPE NOW IF YOU EXCUSE ME I NEED TO HUG SOME HUG ER SQUEEZE SOMETHING BEFORE I SCREAM
BUT YIN YIN THE P YOUNG PANDA WAS NOT LISTENING TO FRED SHE WAS TALKING TO HER BEST FRIEND MAGGIE THE MAGPIE ABOUT GOING TO THE MOON
YES THE BIG ONE IN THE SKY THAT IS MOST LIKELY NOT MADE NOT MADE OF CHEESE AND IS CERTAINLY NOT MADE OF BAMBOO
YIN YIN AND HER BEST FRIEND MAGGIE THE MAGPIE WHO ARE LOOKING WHO LOOKED A LOT LIKE A PANDA WOULD LOOK
SIL
W WOULD LOOK IF PANDAS WERE BIRDS WERE DISCUSSING ABOUT GOING TO THE MOON HER MOTHER AND HER FATHER KNEW THAT WHAT THEY ER WHAT THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT SINCE THEY HADN'T THOUGHT OR TALKED OF MUCH ELSE SINCE YIN YIN SAID I WANT TO GO THERE AND POINTED TO THE MOON
ENOUGH OF THIS NONSENSE SAID YIN YIN'S MOTHER POO POO WHAT SORT OF NONSENSE IS THIS FOR A YOUNG PANDA BEAR GO TO THE MOON INDEED NONSENSE
YOUR JOB IS TO BE CUTE SO PEOPLE WANT TO RUN TO THE GIFT SHOP AND BUY PANDA BEAR DR DOLLS IT'S SIMPLE ECONOMICS
LIKE IT OR NOT WE ARE SPOKESPEOPLE FOR THE PANDA STUFFED ANIMAL INDUSTRY WHICH YOUNG LADY HELPS PAY FOR THE BAMBOO THAT YOU EAT SUCH NONSENSE GOING TO THE MOON SAID HER MOTHER P POO POO BUT
SIL
BUT I JUST LEARNED HOW TO MAKE MYSELF INTO A BALL AND ROLL TWO DAYS AGO AND I'VE B I'M BECOMING VERY GOOD AT IT I DON'T THINK IT WILL TAKE THAT LONG TO ROLL THERE SAID YIN YIN
SIL
YIN YIN'S FATHER MOO MAN DIDN'T THINK IT WAS VERY PROPER OR WISE FOR A YOUNG PANDA BEAR TO GO ROLLING OFF PLACES WHERE THERE WASN'T ANY BAMBOO BUT HE WAS SUPPORTIVE OF THIS H OF HIS YOUNG DAUGHTER AND SHOWING HIS SUPPORT BY TAKING A NAP
BUT BEFORE HE S FELL ASLEEP HE DID MANAGE TO SAY I BELIEVE ROLLING IS A DECIDEDLY ROLLING ABOUT WAY TO GO IF YOU MUST GO IT IT T'WOULD BE BEST TO FLY
NONSENSE SAID THE MOTHER I'M SO MAD I'M GOING TO LOOK AT THAT LADY OVER THERE AND MAKE HER WANT TO SQUEEZE HER SON'S CHEEKS SHE SAID SPITEFULLY
AN INSTANT LATER A YOUNG BOY WAS HEARD SAYING OUCH MOM CUT THAT OUT I'M SORRY TO SAY BUT MANY ER BUT MANY A LITTLE BOY'S CHEEKS HAVE BEEN MADE RAW WHEN MOTHER POO POO PANDA WAS UP UPSET
YIN YIN WAS ALSO ONE TO TAKE ADVICE FROM FATHER BUT LESS THAN A WEEK LATER YIN YIN AND MAGGIE HAD BUILT A ROCKET SHIP OUT OF BAMBOO BAMBOO IS VERY WORKABLE SUB SUBSTANCE AND PANDAS TEND TO HANDLE BAMBOO A LOT SO THIS IN ITSELF WAS NOT ASTONISHING AT LEAST TO THE YIN YIN ER TO THE YIN YIN'S PARENTS FRED WAS SURE WAS IMPRESSED THOUGH
SIL
THE MAIN OBSTACLE IT IT TURNS OUT WAS GETTING THE ROCKET SHIP OFF THE GROUND
MAGGIE FIGURED OUT THAT IF HER AND H THREE OF HER STRONGEST MAGPIE FRIENDS WERE TO EACH GRAB HOLD OF A CORNER OF THE ROCKET SHIP THEY COULD ALL FLY TO THE MOON SO THEY TRIED
ONE TWO THREE TO THE MOON THEY SAID TOGETHER PULLING WITH ALL THEIR MIGHT
I SEE YOUR WINGS FLAPPING BUT WE DON'T SEEM TO BE GOING ANYWHERE SAID YIN YIN
HMM HEAVIER THAN I THOUGHT I THINK WE'LL NEED MORE MAGPIES SAID MAGGIE BUT HOW MANY MORE SAID ER YIN YIN SAID I'M NOT EXACTLY SURE REPLIED MAGGIE
THE FATHER WATCHING ALL THIS THROUGH ONE EYE FOR HE HAD A FOR HE ALWAYS HAD AT LEAST ONE EYE ASLEEP AT ALL TIMES SAID
TIS WOULD BE BEST TO ASK THE OWL AND THEN CLOSED H HIS EYE
SO MAGGIE FLEW OFF TO THE OWL AND ASKED FOR H HIS ADVICE OH WISE OWL I HAVE A QUESTION THAT I FEAR ONLY YOU CAN ANSWER HOW SHE SAID
HOW TO TURN YOUR HEAD ALL THE WAY AROUND WITHOUT GETTING A TERRIBLE PAIN IN YOUR NECK SAID THE SAID OWL
NO HOW MANY MAGPIE'S WOULD BE NEEDED TO FLY A FOUR HUNDRED POUND PANDA BEAR AND A ONE HUNDRED POUND BAMBOO ROCKET SHIP TO THE MOON SAID ER YEAH SAID MAGGIE
SIL
THE OWL INSTANTLY REPLIED TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND AND S SEVENTY SIX GIVE OR TAKE TWO
A WEEK LATER MAGGIE MANAGED TO ROUND UP TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND AND SEVENTY EIGHT MAGPIE SHE COULD BE VERY PERSUASIVE LITTLE BIRD WHEN SHE WANTED
A WEEK LATER DESPITE MUCH FLAPPING THEY WERE ALL TRYING TO GET THE ROCKET INTO THE AIR
IT TURNS OUT THAT THE OWL DIDN'T TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION THAT ONCE YOU GET OVER ONE THOUSAND MAGPIES TOGETHER THEY TEND TO FIGHT AND CAN'T AGREE ON A SINGLE THING
NOW WHILE ALL THIS WAS GOING ON WHAT DO YOU SUPPOSED FRED WAS DOING WHY HE WAS FEEDING THE PANDAS LIKE HE WAS SUPPOSED TO
SO ONE DAY AFTER FRED HAD FE FEED FED THE PANDAS AND WAS HUGGING THE PALM TREE THE ZOO MANAGER CAME UP TO HIM AND SAID WHAT IS GOING ON WITH YOUR PANDAS FRED I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT
IT'S TAKEN ME A COUPLE WEEKS TO FIGURE IT OUT BUT I I THINK YI YIN YIN WANTS TO GO TO THE MOON AND THE MAGPIES WANT TO TAKE HER THERE
OH WELL THAT MAKES SENSE THEN SAID THE MANAGER
DO YOU KNOW THAT SINCE THE LITTLE PANDA BUILT THE BAMBOO ROCKET SHIP AND THOSE AND THOSE MAGPIE'S STARTED FLUTTERING ABOUT THAT THE ZOO'S PROFIT HAVE GONE GONE UP FOUR THOUSAND PERCENT
THIS IS JUST THE TYPE OF EXPOSURE WE NEED THOSE PANDAS WILL BE WITH US FOR A LONG TIME
FRED THOUGHT ABOUT IT AND SAID YOU KNOW I THINK WE SHOULD RENAME YIN YIN COLUMBUS
THE ZOO KEEPER SAID GOOD HEAVENS MAN THAT'S A GREAT IDEA NO WAIT A SECOND I DON'T UNDERSTAND
WELL WHEN COLUMBUS SET OUT ON HIS SHIP HE WAS REALLY TRYING TO FIND A QUICKER WAY TO GET TO GET THROUGH EUROPE IN ORDER TO IMPROVE TRADE
YES BUT WHAT DOES THAT HAVE TO DO WITH PANDAS MAN
WELL IT SEEMS TO ME SIR THAT YIN YIN WANTS TO BE A GREAT EXPLORER INSTEAD BECAME A BUSINESS WOMAN
I SEE FRED ONE MORE THING SIR ABOUT THESE MAGPIES FLYING ABOVE THE PANDAS DO YOU THINK THAT THE ZOO COULD PURCHASE ME A LARGE SIZED UMBRELLA
THE ZOO MANAGER LAUGHED AND WALKED AWAY BUT DID NOT PUR PURCHASE A FASHIONABLE YELLOW UMBRELLA FOR FRED THE NEXT DAY
BACK IN THE PANDA'S HOME THE MOTHER PANDA POO POO WAS VERY PROUD OF HER DAUGHTER
AFTER ALL IF IT WEREN'T FOR YIN YIN THEY WOULDN'T HAVE THEY WOULD HAVE HAD TO MOVE FROM THEIR WONDERFUL HOME
BUT LATER WHEN FRED WALKED INTO PANDA'S HOME UNDER HIS NEW YELLOW UMBRELLA ALL SHE COULD THINK OF TO SAY WAS NONSENSE
AS FOR YIN YIN SHE'S VERY PROUD TO BE RENAMED AFTER A FAMOUS EXPLORER AND SHE AND MAGGIE NEVER STOPPED TRYING TO GET TO THE MOON
UHM WHAT HAPPENED IN THE STORY WAS UHM THERE WAS A PANDA NAMED YIN YIN AND SHE UH WAS UHM LIKE SHE WAS
SHE BASICALLY TRIED TO GET SHE BUILT LIKE A BAMBOO ROCKET AND SHE TRIED TO GET TO THE MOON
AND THREE MAGPIES WERE TRYING TO HELP HER BY FLYING HER UP THERE BUT IT DIDN'T WORK SO THEY WENT AND ASKED THE UHM
SIL
THE OWL IN THE STORY ABOUT HOW MANY UHM MAGPIES IT'D TAKE TO FLY AND IT WAS LIKE TWO THOUSAND AND SEVENTY EIGHT
AND BUT IT DIDN'T WORK BECAUSE ALL THE MAGPIES UH STARTED FIGHTING
AND BUT WHAT DID HAPPEN IS UHM THE PROFITS FOR THE ZOO INCREASED AND SO UHM THE
SIL
THE PANDA'S LIKE THE ZOO WAS ABOUT TO BE BOUGHT OUT BEFORE ALL THIS HAPPENED BUT THEIR PROFITS RAISED FOUR THOUSAND PERCENT
SO THEN THEY GOT TO STAY AT THE ZOO AND SO INSTEAD OF BECOMING A GREAT EXPLORER UHM YIN YIN BECAME A GREAT UH BUSINESS WOMAN
BUT SHE GOT NAMED COLOMBUS AFTER THE GREAT EXPLORER COLOMBUS
AND IT'S KIND OF THE OPPOSITE OF COLOMBUS BECAUSE HE WANTED TO BE A GREAT BUSINESS MAN BUT INSTEAD HE ENDED UP A GREAT EXPLORER SO
SIL
<br>
SIL
FRED UHM WELL THERE'S FRED AND HE WAS THE MANAGER ER NO HE WAS THE PERSON WHO FRED ALL FED ALL THE ANIMALS
AND HE DIDN'T LIKE FEEDING THE TIGERS CAUSE HE WAS AFRAID HE WAS GOING TO GET EATEN
BUT WHEN HE FED UHM FED THE PANDA'S HE ALWAYS WANTED TO HUG THEM BUT HE WASN'T ALLOWED TO BECAUSE LIKE THE PANDA'S SUPPOSEDLY HAVE SOME MAGIC ABOUT THEM
WHERE IF ANY HUMAN GETS WITHIN THREE FEET THEY LIKE HAVE TO HUG SOMETHING
OR ELSE THEY'LL GO WILD OR SOMETHING
AND THEN UHM ALSO THERE'S UH YIN YIN'S PARENTS UH POO POO
AND UHM HER MOTHER AND MOO MAN HER FATHER AND WHEN UH POO POO HER UH YIN YIN'S MOTHER GETS ANGRY SHE UH
SIL
SHE UHM
SIL
OH YEAH SHE SOMETIMES MAKES UHM MOTHER'S SQUEEZE THEIR KIDS CHEEKS AND SO WHEN SHE GETS ANGRY A BUNCH OF KIDS GET THEIR CHEEKS RUBBED RAW
AND THEN THERE'S THE MANAGER AND I DON'T KNOW HE DOESN'T DO MUCH IN THIS STORY

THE PANDA
WHY DID A PANDA WITH THE BEAUTIFUL GIRL NAME YIN YIN HAVE HER NAME CHANGED TO THE VERY UN BEAUTIFUL GIRL NAME COLUMBUS
IT WAS FRED'S IDEA SO LET'S BEGIN WITH FRED
FRED FED THE PANDA BEARS THE TIGERS AND TURTLES THE TURTLES WEREN'T SO BAD BUT AS FOR THE TIGERS TIGERS HE WASN'T SO SURE
HE DIDN'T MIND HANDLING THE RAW MEAT HE HAD TO FEED TO THE TIGERS HIS MAIN OBJECTION WAS BEING EATEN

<br> MANY PEOPLE KNEW THAT PANDAS EAT BAMBOO A LOT OF IT
A LOT OF BAMBOO CAN GET QUITE HEAVY SO BECAUSE OF THE PANDAS FRED BECAME VERY STRONG AND WAS IN TERRIFIC SHAPE
BUT PHYSICAL FITNESS WAS NOT THE ONLY REASON THAT FRED LOVED THE PANDAS
THE OTHER REASON WAS THAT ANYONE WHO GETS WITHIN THREE FEET OF A PANDA AUTOMATICALLY FALLS IN LOVE WITH THEM
<unk> IT'S A LAW OF NATURE AT FURTHER DISTANCES PANDAS HAVE A STRANGE ALMOST MAGICAL EFFECT ON HUMAN BEINGS WHICH MAKES US WANT TO HUG AND SQUEEZE THINGS
FRED WAS NOT ALLOWED TO ACTUALLY HUG THE PANDA BEARS SINCE THAT COULD BE DANGEROUS
SO ALL THE OTHER PEOPLE AT THE ZOO WOULD KNOW THAT THE PANDAS HAD JUST BEEN FED WHEN THEY SAW FRED HUGGING THE RATHER UN CUDDLY PALM TREE OUTSIDE OF THE PANDA'S PANDA'S HOME
<br> IT IS I IT IS INTERESTING TO POINT OUT THIS AT A TIME
SIL
THAT MORE SUFFERED PANDA BEARS ARE SOLD AT ZOO GIFT SHOPS
SIL
THEN ALL OF THE OTHER STUFF COMBINED
THIS CAN ALMOST CERTAINLY BE ACCOUNTED FOR BY THE STRANGE ALMOST MAGICAL EFFECT THAT THE PANDAS POSSESS
SIL
BUT EVERYTHING WAS NOT ALL BAMBOO AND HUGS AT THE ZOO
ONE MORNING WHEN FRED WAS FEEDING YIN YIN AND SAID <unk> OH YIN YIN I WISH THAT MORE PEOPLE WOULD COME AND VISIT THE ZOO
I KNOW I SHOULDN'T BE TELLING YOU THIS BUT WE MIGHT HAVE TO SELL YOU AND YOUR FAMILY TO THE BIG ZOO IN SAN ANGELES IF WE DON'T GET MORE MONEY

THE FATHER WATCHING THIS ALL THROUGH ONE EYE FOR HE ALWAYS HAD AT LEAST ONE EYE ASLEEP AT ALL TIMES

NOW WHILE ALL THIS WAS GOING ON WHAT DO YOU SUPPOSED FRED WAS DOING
WHY HE WAS FEEDING THE PANDAS LIKE HE WAS SUPPOSED TO
SO ONE DAY AFTER FRED HAD FED THE PANDAS AND WAS HUGGING THE PALM TREE THE ZOO MANAGER CAME UP TO HIM AND SAID
WHAT IS GOING ON WITH YOUR PANDAS FRED I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT

BACK IN THE PANDA'S HOME THE MOTHER PANDA POO POO WAS VERY PROUD OF HER DAUGHTER
AFTER ALL IF IT WEREN'T FOR YIN YIN THEY WOULD HAVE TO MOVE FROM THEIR WONDERFUL HOME

THE PANDA
WHY DID A PANDA WITH A BEAUTIFUL GIRL NAME YIN YIN HAVE HER NAME CHANGED TO THE B TO THE VERY UN BEAUTIFUL GIRL NAME COLUMBUS
IT WAS FRED'S IDEA SO LET'S BEGIN WITH FRED
FRED FED THE PANDA BEARS THE TIGERS AND THE TURTLES
THE TURTLES WEREN'T SO BAD BUT AS FOR THE TIGERS HE WASN'T SO SURE
HE DIDN'T MIND HANDLING THE RAW MEAT HE HAD TO FEED TO THE TIGERS HIS MAIN OBJECTION WAS TO BEING TO BEING EATEN
NO ONE COULD BLAME FRED REALLY SINCE NO ONE REALLY WANTS TO BE EATEN
SOME PEOPLE DO NOT LIKE TO BITE THEIR FINGER NAILS BUT FRED WASN'T A NAIL BITER SO BEING EATEN WAS DEFINITELY NOT SOMETHING HE LOOKED FORWARD TO
EACH AFTERNOON AT THREE O'CLOCK WHEN IT WAS TIME TO FEED THE TIGERS
FOR FRED WHEN IT CAME TO THE PANDAS HE HAD A WARM SPOT IN HIS HEART ACTUALLY IT WAS A EIGHTY FIVE POINT FIVE DEGREE SPOT ON HIS LEFT KIDNEY
<br> BUT THE POINT IS THAT HE WAS VERY FOND OF FEEDING THE PANDAS
THERE WERE THREE PANDAS AND THEY WERE KNOWN AS THE PAN FAMILY
<br> THEY WERE IN ORDER OF CUTENESS YIN YIN THE YOUNG DAUGHTER POO POO AND MOTHER AND MOO MAN THE GENTLE AND ALWAYS SLEEPY FATHER
MANY PEOPLE KNOW THAT PANDAS EAT BAMBOO A LOT OF IT
A LOT OF BAMBOO CAN GET QUITE HEAVY SO BECAUSE OF THE PANDAS FRED BECAME VERY STRONG AND WAS
SIL
IN TERRIFIC SHAPE
BUT PHYSICAL FITNESS WAS NOT THE ONLY REASON THAT FRED LOVED THE PANDA
THE OTHER REASON WAS THAT ANYONE WHO GETS WITHIN THREE FEET OF THE PANDA AUTOMATICALLY FALLS IN LOVE WITH THEM
IT'S A LAW OF NATURE
AT FURTHER DISTANCES PANDAS HAVE A STRANGE ALMOST MAGICAL EFFECT ON HUMAN BEINGS <unk> WHICH MAKES US WANT TO HUG AND SQUEEZE THINGS
FRED WAS NOT ALLOWED TO ACTUALLY HUG THE PANDA BEARS SINCE THAT COULD BE DANGEROUS
SO ALL THE OTHER PEOPLE AT THE ZOO WOULD NOT KNOW THAT THE PANDAS HAD JUST BEEN FED WHEN THEY SAW FRED HUGGING THE RATHER UN CUDDLY PALM TREE OUTSIDE OF THE PANDA'S HOME
IT IS INTERESTING TO POINT OUT AT THIS TIME THAT MORE STUFFED PANDA BEARS ARE SOLD TO ZOO GIFT SHOPS THEN ALL OF THE OTHER STUFFED ANIMALS COMBINED
THIS CAN ALMOST CERTAINLY BE ACCOUNTED FOR BY THIS STRANGE ALMOST MAGICAL EFFECT THAT THE PANDA POSSESS POSSESS
BUT EVERYTHING WAS NOT ALL BAMBOO AND HUGS AT THE ZOO
ONE MORNING FRED WAS FEEDING YIN YIN AND SAID OH YIN YIN I WISH THAT MORE PEOPLE WOULD COME TO VISIT THE ZOO
I KNOW I SHOULDN'T BE TELLING YOU THIS BUT WE MIGHT HAVE TO SELL YOU AND YOUR FAMILY TO THE BIG ZOO IN SAN ANGELES
IF WE DON'T GET MORE MONEY IT'S NOT THAT YOU AREN'T SELLING ENOUGH STUFFED PANDA BEARS
IT'S JUST THAT THEY HAVEN'T BEEN ENOUGH PEOPLE COMING TO SEE YOU IN THE FIRST PLACE
I THINK THAT THE ZOO NEEDS ITS A GREAT ADVENTURE CAMPAIGN
FRED WAS STARTING TO FEEL THE UNCOMFORTABLE URGE TO HUG THE PANDA
SO BEFORE HE RAN OFF TO HUG THE PALM TREE QUICKLY HE SAID IT COSTS SO MUCH TO FEED YOU PANDA BEARS I WOULD HATE IT IF YOU HAD TO LEAVE US
AFTER ALL IT'S ONLY HOME YOU KNOW BESIDES IF YOU LEAVE I'LL GET TERRIBLY OUT OF SHAPE
NOW IF YOU EXCUSE ME I NEED TO SQUEEZE SOMETHING BEFORE I SCREAM
BUT YIN YIN THE YOUNG PANDA WAS NOT LISTENING TO FRED SHE WAS TALKING TO HER BEST FRIEND MAGGIE AND MAGPIE ABOUT GOING TO THE MOON
SIL
<br> YES THE BIG ONE IN THE SKY THAT IS MOST LIKELY NOT MADE OF CHEESE AND MOST CERTAINLY NOT MADE OF BAMBOO
YIN YIN AND HER BEST FRIEND MAGGIE AND THE MAGPIE <unk> WHO LOOKED A LOT LIKE A PANDA WOULD LOOK IF PANDAS WERE BIRDS
SIL
WERE DISCUSSING ABOUT GOING TO THE MOON
HER MOTHER AND FATHER KNEW WHAT THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT SINCE THEY HADN'T THOUGHT OR TALKED OF MUCH ELSE SINCE YIN YIN SAID
I WANT TO GO THERE AND POINTED TO THE MOON
ENOUGH OF THIS NONSENSE SAID YIN YIN'S MOTHER POO POO
WHAT SORT OF NONSENSE IS THIS FOR A YOUNG PANDA BEAR GOING TO THE MOON INDEED NONSENSE
YOUR JOB IS TO BE CUTE SO PEOPLE WON'T TO RUN TO THE GIFT SHOP AND BUY PANDA BEAR DOLLS
IT'S SIMPLE ECONOMICS
LIKE IT OR NOT WE ARE SPOKESPEOPLE FOR THE PANDAS STUFFED ANIMALS INDUSTRY WHICH YOUNG LADY HELPS PAY FOR THE BAMBOO THAT YOU EAT
SUCH NONSENSE GOING TO THE MOON SAID HER MOTHER POO POO
BUT I JUST LEARNED HOW TO MAKE MYSELF INTO A BALL AND ROLL TWO DAYS AGO I'VE I HAVE BECOMING VERY GOOD AT IT
I DON'T THINK IT WILL TAKE THAT LONG TO ROLL THERE SAID YIN YIN
YIN YIN'S FATHER MOO MAN
SIL
DIDN'T THINK IT WAS VERY PROPER OR WISE FOR A YOUNG PANDA BEAR TO GO ROLLING OFF TO PLACES WHERE THERE WASN'T ANY BAMBOO
BUT HE WAS SUPPORTIVE OF HIS YOUNG DAUGHTER AND SHOWED HIS SUPPORT BY TAKING A NAP
BUT BEFORE HE FELL TO SLEEP HE DID MANAGE TO SAY
NONSENSE SAID THE MOTHER I'M SO MAD I'M GOING TO LOOK AT THE LADY OVER THERE AND MAKE HER WANT TO SQUEEZE HER SON CHEEKS SHE SAID SPITEFULLY
AN INSTANT LATER A YOUNG BOY WAS HEARD SAYING OUCH MOM CUT THAT OUT
I'M SORRY TO SAY BUT MANY A LITTLE BOY'S CHEEKS HAVE BEEN MADE RAW WHEN MOTHER POO POO PANDA WAS UPSET
YIN YIN WAS ALWAYS ONE TO TAKE GOOD ADVICE FROM HER FATHER <unk> AND LESS THAN A WEEK LATER YIN YIN AND MAGGIE HAD BUILT A ROCKET SHIP OUT OF BAMBOO
BAMBOO IS VERY WORKABLE SUBSTANCE AND PANDAS TEND TO HANDLE BAMBOO A LOT SO THIS IS IN ITSELF WAS NOT THAT ASTONISHING
AT LEAST TO YIN YINS PARENTS FREDS SURE WAS IMPRESSED THOUGH
THE MAIN OBSTACLE IT TURNS OUT WAS GETTING THE ROCKET SHIP OFF THE GROUND
MAGGIE FIGURED THAT IF SHE HAD THREE OF HER STRONGEST MAGPIE FRIENDS WERE TO EACH GRAB HOLD OF THE CORNER OF THE ROCKET SHIP THEY COULD ALL FLY TO THE MOON
SIL
SO THEY TRIED ONE TWO THREE TO THE MOON THEY SAID TOGETHER PULLING IN THEIR MIGHT
SIL
I SEE YOUR WINGS FLAPPING BUT WE DON'T SEE SEEM TO BE GOING ANYWHERE SAID YIN YIN
HMM HEAVIER THAN I THOUGHT I THINK WE WILL NEED SOME MAGPIES SAID MAGGIE
YES BUT HOW MANY MORE YIN YIN SAID I'M NOT EXACTLY SURE REPLIED MAGGIE
THE FATHER WATCHING THIS ALL THROUGH ONE EYE
SIL
FOR HE WAS FOR HE ALWAYS HAD AT LEAST ONE EYE ASLEEP AT ALL TIMES
SIL
SAID T'WOULD BE BEST TO ASK THE OWL
SIL
THEN CLOSED HIS EYE
SO MAGGIE FLEW TO THE OWL AND ASKED FOR HIS ADVICE
OH WISE OWL I HAVE A QUESTION THAT I FEAR ONLY YOU CAN ANSWER SHE SAID
HOW TO TURN YOUR HEAD ALL THE WAY AROUND WITHOUT GETTING A TERRIBLE PAIN IN YOUR NECK SAID OWL
SIL
NO HOW MANY MAGPIES WOULD BE NEEDED TO FLY A FOUR HUNDRED POUND PANDA BEAR AND A ONE HUNDRED POUND BAMBOO ROCKET SHIP TO THE MOON SAID MAGGIE
THE OWL INSTANTLY INSTANTLY REPLIED TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND AND SEVENTY SIX GIVE OR TAKE TWO
SIL
A WEEK LATER MAGGIE MANAGED TO ROUND UP TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND AND SEVENTY EIGHT MAGPIE
<br> SHE COULD BE A VERY PERSUASIVE LITTLE BIRD WHEN SHE WANTED
A WEEK LATER DESPITE MUCH FLAPPING THEY WERE STILL TRYING AND TO GET OUT THE ROCKET IN THE AIR
IT TURNS OUT THAT THE OWL DIDN'T TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION THAT ONCE YOU GET OVER ONE THOUSAND MAGPIE TOGETHER <unk> THEY TEND TO FIGHT AND CAN'T AGREE ON ONE SINGLE THING
<br> NOW WHILE ALL THIS WAS GOING ON WHAT DO YOU SUPPOSED FRED WAS DOING
WHY HE WAS FEEDING PANDAS LIKE HE WAS SUPPOSED TO DO
SO ONE DAY AFTER FRED HAD FED THE PANDAS AND WAS HUGGING THE PALM TREE THE ZOO MANAGER CAME UP TO HIM AND SAID
WHAT IS GOING ON WITH YOUR PANDAS FRED I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT
IT'S TAKEN ME A COUPLE OF WEEKS TO FIGURE IT OUT BUT I THINK YIN YIN WANTS TO GO TO THE MOON AND THE MAGPIES WANT TO TAKE HER THERE SAID FRED
OH WELL THAT MAKES SENSE THEN SAID THE MANAGER
DID YOU KNOW THAT SINCE THE LITTLE PANDA BUILT THAT BAMBOO ROCKET SHIP AND THOSE MAGPIES STARTED FLUTTERING ABOUT THAT THE ZOO'S PROFITS HAS GONE UP F FOUR THOUSAND PERCENT
THIS IS JUST THE TYPE OF EXPOSURE WE NEEDED <unk> THOSE PANDAS WILL BE WITH US FOR A LONG TIME
FRED THOUGHT ABOUT IT AND SAID YOU KNOW I THINK WE SHOULD RENAME YIN YIN COLUMBUS
THE ZOO KEEPER SAID GOOD HEAVENS MAN THAT IS A GREAT IDEA NO WAIT A SECOND I UNDERSTAND
WELL SIR
SIL
WHEN COLUMBUS SET OUT ON HIS SHIP HE WAS REALLY TRYING TO FIND A QUICKER WAY TO GET TO GET AROUND EUROPE IN ORDER TO IMPROVE TRADE
HE WANTED TO BE A BUSINESS MAN BUT INSTEAD BECAME A GREAT EXPLORER
YES BUT WHAT DOES THAT HAVE TO DO WITH THE THE PANDAS MAN SAID THE ZOO KEEPER MANAGER
WELL IT SEEMS TO ME SIR THAT YIN YIN WANTED TO BE A GREAT EXPLORER BUT HAD BECOME A BUSINESS WOMAN
I SEE FRED
ONE MORE THING SIR <unk> ABOUT THOSE MAGPIES FLYING ABOVE THE PANDAS DO YOU THINK THAT THE ZOO COULD PURCHASE ME A LARGE SIZED UMBRELLA
THE ZOO MANAGER LAUGHED AND WALKED AWAY BUT DIDN'T PURCHASE A FASHIONABLE YELLOW UMBRELLA FOR FRED THE NEXT DAY
SIL
BACK IN THE PANDA'S HOME THE MOTHER PANDA POO POO WAS VERY PROUD OF HER DAUGHTER
AFTER ALL IT WEREN'T IF IT WEREN'T FOR YIN YIN THEY WOULD HAVE HAD TO MOVE FROM THEIR WONDERFUL HOME
BUT LATER WHEN FRED WALKED INTO THE PANDA'S H HOME UNDER A A HIS NEW YELLOW UMBRELLA ALL SHE COULD THINK TO SAY WAS NONSENSE
AS FOR YIN SHE WAS VERY PROUD TO BE RENAMED AFTER A FAMOUS EXPLORER AND SHE AND MAGGIE NEVER STOPPED TRYING TO GET TO THE MOON
I DON'T KNOW IT WAS ABOUT SOME PANDA WHO WANTED TO GO TO THE MOON
<unk>
SIL
UHM IT WAS ABOUT THIS LIKE PANDA NAMED
SIL
UH YIN YIN AND UHM SHE WANTED TO GO TO THE MOON
AND SO AND HER MOM DIDN'T WANT HER TO BUT HER DAD JUST REALLY DIDN'T CARE AND UHM SO SHE BUILT A BAMBOO ROCKET WITH HER FRIEND MAGPIE ER WHATEVER
AND UH SHE AND THAT PERS AND MAGPIE LIKE BUILT IT AND THEN THEY DIDN'T KNOW HOW THEY WERE GOING TO GO GET UP CAUSE ONE MAGPIE COULDN'T LIFT THE ROCKET AND THE THING SO TH AND THEY WENT TO THE OWL
AND THE OWL TOLD THEM TO UHM TO GET LIKE A SPECIFIC NUMBER OF MAGPIES AND UHM LIKE TO PUSH THE ROCKET UP
AND THEN THE OWL DIDN'T THINK ABOUT HOW MANY LIKE HOW THEY WOULD ALL FIGHT AND STUFF SO THEY WEREN'T GETTING ALONG
AND THEN UHM FRED LIKE THE MANAGER CAME UP TO FRED ONE DAY AFTER HE WAS FEEDING THE PANDAS AND THE MANAGER SAID UHM WHAT ARE YOUR PANDA'S DOING AND HE ANSWERED LIKE
SIL
WELL I THINK
IT'S TAKEN ME A WEEK TO FIGURE IT OUT BUT
SIL
YOU KNOW I THINK YIN YIN WANTS TO GO TO THE MOON
AND THEN HE SAID WELL IT'S BROUGHT US UP LIKE FOUR THOUSAND PERCENT AND IT'S REALLY GOOD AND SO THOSE PANDAS ARE GOING TO STAY HERE A LONG TIME
THE RED LEAVES WERE BLOWN AROUND IN MILLIONS BY THE WIND
AND MEANWHILE BY THE FURTHER RIVER BANK CAME ROSALIND WITH MUSHROOMS IN HER SKIRT
NOW GO AND ANSWER YOUR NOTE LET ME FINISH THIS SPLENDID STORY
MORE COURAGE THAN MY POOR BROTHER WHO STANDS THERE LIKE A COWARD
HE SHE RUSHES FRANTICALLY ACROSS THE APARTMENT SEIZING HER HOOD AND RAN FROM THE COTTAGE
<br> THEY CARRIED THEMSELVES AS IF AS IF THEY HAD BEEN DRILLED BOTH MEN AND WOMEN
LINDY NOT BEING OVERBURDENED WITH PERCEPTION DID NOT SEE THIS
I FEAR THAT WE SHALL HAVE ANOTHER SMART GALE HOWEVER IT WON'T LAST LONG
OF COURSE THERE'S NOTHING VERY ENTERTAINING HERE FOR YOU
THE YOUNGSTER LINGERED FOR A MOMENT OR TWO WATCHING MYLES AT HIS WORK
THE DAY ETHEL BROWN WAS SEVEN YEARS OLD SHE HAD A TEA PARTY
THESE WORDS QUITE DESTROYED THE HOPE OF HOPE THAT OF LATE HAD BEEN GLOWING WITHIN HER
ITS FLAVOR WHEN COOKED IS MORE EXQUISITE FAR THAN MUTTON OR OYSTERS OR EGGS
I AM IN EARNEST HUCK JUST AS EARNEST AS AS EVER I WAS IN MY LIFE
HUMOR AND PATHOS MAKE IT ALIVE YOU HAVE FOUND YOUR STYLE AT LAST
SIL
SEAGRAVE KNELT BY HIS SIDE TOOK HIS HAND AND BURST INTO TEARS
NAN SAID IT WOULDN'T GROW IN OUR GARDEN BUT I BROUGHT SOME HOME TO TRY
HIS BOOTS CREAKED TOO SO LOUDLY BUT STILL HE WAS NOT AT ALL AFRAID
SHE WILL BE GLAD TO SEE YOU BUT SHE HAS BEEN VERY BADLY FRIGHTENED
HE TURNED HIS BACK ON THE BOY AND CONFERRED ASIDE WITH LAWRENCE
I DESIRE IT SO MUCH THAT I WILL TAKE NO REFUSAL
AND THE PRIZE CUP GREW CLEARER AND NEARER TO HER MENTAL VISION
BEHIND LAY THE SHIP A PICTURE NOT WITHOUT ITS LIGHTER SIDE
SIL
THE PANDA
WHY DID THE PANDA WITH THE BEAUTIFUL GIRL NAME YIN YIN HAVE HER NAME CHANGED TO THE VERY UN BEAUTIFUL GIRL NAMED COLUMBUS
IT WAS FRED'S IDEA SO LET'S BEGIN WITH FRED
FRED FED THE PANDA BEARS AND THE TIGERS AND TURTLES
THE TURTLES WEREN'T SO BAD BUT AS FOR THE TIGERS HE WASN'T SO SURE
HE DIDN'T MIND HANDLING THE RAW MEAT HE HAD TO FEED TO THE TIGERS
BUT HIS MAIN OBJECTION WAS BEING EATEN
NO ONE COULD BLAME FRED REALLY SINCE NO ONE REALLY WANTS TO BE EATEN
SOME PEOPLE DO NOT LIKE TO BITE THEIR FINGER NAILS BUT FRED WASN'T A NAIL BITER
SO BEING EATEN WAS DEFINITELY NOT SOMETHING HE LOOKED FORWARD T TO EACH AFTERNOON AT THREE O'CLOCK WHEN IT WAS TIME TO FEED THE TIGERS
FOR FRED WHEN IT CAME TO THE PANDAS HE HAD A WARM SPOT IN HIS HEART
ACTUALLY IT WAS AN EIGHT FIVE POINT FIVE DEGREE SPOT ON HIS LEFT KIDNEY BUT THE POINT IS THAT HE WAS VERY FOND OF FEEDING THE PANDAS
THERE WERE THREE PANDAS AND THEY WERE KNOWN AS THE PAN FAMILY
<br>
THEY WERE IN ORDER OF CUTENESS YIN YIN THE YOUNG DAUGHTER POO POO THE MOTHER AND MOO MAN THE GENTLE AND ALWAYS SLEEPING FATHER
SIL
MANY PEOPLE KNOW THAT PANDAS EAT BAMBOO A LOT OF IT
A LOT OF BAMBOO CAN GET QUITE HEAVY SO BECAUSE OF THE PANDAS FRED BECAME VERY STRONG
AND WAS IN TERRIFIC SHAPE BUT PHYSICAL FITNESS WAS NOT THE ONLY REASON THAT FRED LOVED PANDAS
THE OTHER REASON THAT WAS WAS THAT ANYONE WHO GETS WITHIN THREE FEET OF A PANDA AUTOMATICALLY FALLS IN LOVE WITH THEM
IT'S A LAW OF NATURE
AT FURTHER DISTANCES PANDAS HAVE A STRANGE ALMOST MAGICAL EFFECT ON HUMAN BEINGS
WHICH MAKES US WANT TO HUG AND SQUEEZE THINGS
FRED WAS NOT ALLOWED TO ACTUALLY HUG THE PANDA BEARS SINCE THAT COULD BE DANGEROUS
SO ALL THE OTHER PEOPLE AT THE ZOO KNOW WOULD KNOW THAT THE PANDAS HAD JUST BEEN FED WHEN THEY SAW FRED HUGGING THE RATHER UN CUDDLY PALM TREE OUTSIDE THE PANDA'S HOME
SIL
IT IS INTERESTING TO POINT OUT AT THIS TIME THAT MORE STUFFED PANDA BEARS ARE SOLD AT ZOO GIFT SHOPS THEN ALL OF THE OTHER STUFF ANIMALS COMBINED
THIS CAN ALSO ALMOST BE CER THIS CAN ALMOST CERTAINLY BE ACCOUNTED FOR BY THIS STRANGE ALMOST MAGICAL EFFECT THAT THE PANDAS POSSESS
BUT EVERYTHING WAS NOT ALL BAMBOO AND HUGS AT THE ZOO ONE MORNING FRED WAS FEEDING YIN YIN AND SAID OH YIN YIN I WISH THAT MORE PEOPLE COULD COME TO VISIT THE ZOO
I KNOW I SHOULDN'T BE TELLING YOU THIS BUT WE MIGHT HAVE TO SELL YOU AND YOUR FAMILY TO THE BIG ZOO IN SAN ANGELES IF WE DON'T GET MORE MONEY
IT'S NOT THAT WE
SIL
IT'S NOT THAT YOU AREN'T SELLING ENOUGH STUFFED PANDA BEARS IT'S JUST THAT THERE HAVEN'T BEEN ENOUGH PEOPLE COMING TO SEE YOU IN THE FIRST PLACE
I THINK THAT THE ZOO NEEDS
SIL
IS I THINK THAT WHAT THE ZOO NEEDS
I THINK WHAT THE ZOO NEEDS IS A GREAT ADVERTISING CAMPAIGN
FRED WAS STARTING TO FEEL THE UNCONTROLLABLE URGE TO HUG THE PANDA SO BEFORE HE RAN OFF TO HUG THE PALM TREE QUICKLY SAID IT COSTS SO MUCH TO FEED YOU PANDA BEARS I WOULD HATE
SIL
IT I WOULD HATE IF YOU HAD TO LEAVE US AFTER ALL IT'S THE ONLY HOME YOU KNOW BESIDES IF YOU LEAVE I'LL GET TERRIBLY OUT OF SHAPE NOW IF YOU EXCUSE ME I NEED TO SQUEEZE SOMETHING BEFORE I SCREAM
BUT YIN YIN WAS THE YOUNG
SIL
BUT YIN YIN THE YOUNG PANDA WAS NOT LISTENING TO FRED SHE WAS TALKING TO HER BEST FRIEND MAGGIE THE MAGPIE ABOUT GOING TO THE MOON
<br> YES THE BIG ONE IN THE SKY THAT IS MOST LIKELY NOT MADE OF CHEESE AND IS MOST CERTAINLY NOT MADE OF BAMBOO
YIN YIN AND HER BEST FRIEND MAGPIE MAGGIE THE MAGPIE WHO LOOKED A LOT LIKE A PANDA WOULD LOOK IF PANDAS WERE BIRDS
SIL
WHERE WHERE DISCUSSING ABOUT GOING TO THE MOON WERE DISCUSSING ABOUT GOING TO THE MOON
HER MOTHER AND FATHER KNEW WHAT THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT SINCE THEY HADN'T THOUGHT OR TALKED OF MUCH ELSE SINCE YIN YIN SAID I WANT TO GO THERE AND POINTED TO THE MOON
ENOUGH OF THIS NONSENSE SAID YIN YIN'S MOTHER POO POO
WHAT SORT OF NONSENSE IS THIS FOR A YOUNG PANDA BEAR GOING TO THE MOON INDEED
NONSENSE YOUR JOB IS TO BE CUTE SO PEOPLE WANT TO RUN TO THE GIFT SHOP AND BUY PANDA BEAR DOLLS
IT'S SIMPLE ECONOMICS LIKE IT OR NOT WE ARE SPOKESPEOPLE FOR THE PANDA STUFFED ANIMAL INDUSTRY
WHICH YOUNG LADY HELPS PAY FOR THE BAMBOO THAT YOU EAT
SUCH NONSENSE GOING TO THE MOON SAID HER MOTHER POO POO
BUT I JUST LEARNED HOW TO MAKE MYSELF INTO A BALL AND ROLL TWO DAYS AGO AND I'VE BECOMING VERY GOOD AT THAT I DON'T THINK THAT IT WILL TAKE THAT LONG TO ROLL THERE SAID YIN YIN
YIN YIN'S FATHER MOO MAN DIDN'T THINK THAT IT WAS VERY PROPER OR WISE FOR A YOUNG PANDA BEAR TO GO ROLLING OFF PLACES WHERE THERE WASN'T ANY BAMBOO BUT HE WAS SUPPORTIVE OF HIS YOUNG DAUGHTER
AND SHOWED HIS SUPPORT BY TAKING A NAP
BUT BEFORE HE FELL ASLEEP HE DID MANAGE TO SAY I BELIEVE ROLLING IS A DECIDEDLY
SIL
IS A DECIDEDLY ROUND ABOUT WAY TO GO IF YOU MUST GO
SIL
IT
SIL
T'WOULD BE BEST TO FLY
NONSENSE SAID THE MOTHER I'M SO MAD I'M GOING TO LOOK AT THAT LADY OVER THERE AND MAKE HER WANT TO SQUEEZE HER SON CHEEKS
SHE SAID SPITEFULLY AN INSTANT LATER A YOUNG BOY WAS HEARD SAYING OUCH MOM CUT THAT OUT
I'M SORRY TO SAY BUT MANY
SIL
A LITTLE BOY'S CHEEKS HAVE BEEN MADE RAW WHEN THEIR MOTHER POO POO PANDA WAS UPSET
YIN YIN WAS ALWAYS ONE TO TAKE GOOD ADVICE FROM HER FATHER AND LESS THAN A WEEK LATER YIN YIN AND MAGPIE MAGPIE MAGGIE HAD BUILT A ROCKET SHIP OUT OF BAMBOO
BAMBOO IS VERY WORKABLE SUBSTANCE THAT PANDAS TEND TO HANDLE BAMBOO A LOT SO THIS IS IN ITSELF WAS NOT THAT ASTONISHING AT LEAST TO YIN YIN'S PARENTS FRED SURE WAS IMPRESSED THOUGH
THE MAIN OBSTACLE IT TURNS OUT WAS GETTING THE ROCKETSHIP OFF THE GROUND
MAGGIE FIGURED THAT IF SHE AND THREE OF HER STRONGEST MAGPIE FRIENDS MAGPIE FRIENDS
SIL
WERE TO
SIL
WERE TO EACH GRAB HOLD OF THE CORNER OF THE ROCKETSHIP THEY COULD ALL FLY TO THE MOON SO THEY TRIED
ONE TWO THREE TO THE MOON THEY ALL SAID TOGETHER PULLING WITH ALL THEIR MIGHT
<br> I SEE YOUR WINGS FLAPPING BUT WE DON'T SEEM TO BE GOING ANYWHERE YIN YIN
HMM HEAVIER THAN I THOUGHT I THINK WE'LL NEED MORE MAGPIES MAGGIE SAID MAGGIE
YES BUT HOW MANY MORE YIN YIN SAID I'M NOT SURE EXACTLY SAID MAG MAGGIE
THE FATHER WATCHING THIS ALL THROUGH ONE EYE
SIL
FOR HE HAD ALWAYS HAD AT LEAST ONE EYE ASLEEP AT ALL TIMES SAID
T'WOULD BE BEST TO ASK THE OWL HE CLOSED HIS EYE THEN CLOSED EYE
SO MAGGIE FLEW TO THE OWL AND ASKED FOR ADVICE
OH WISE OWL I HAVE A QUESTION THAT I FEAR YOU ONLY YOU CAN ANSWER SHE SAID
HOW
SIL
TO TURN YOUR HEAD ALL THE WAY AROUND WITHOUT GO WITHOUT GETTING A TERRIBLE PAIN IN YOUR NECK SAID OWL
NO HOW MANY MAGPIE'S WOULD IT WOULD BE NEEDED TO FLY A FOUR HOUR I MEAN HUNDRED POUND PANDA BEAR AND A ONE HUNDRED POUND BAMBOO ROCKET TO THE SHIP I MEAN ROCKETSHIP TO THE MOON SAID MAGGIE THE OWL INSTANTLY INSTANTLY REPLIED
TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND AND SEVENTY SIX GIVE OR TAKE TWO
SIL
A WEEK LATER MAGGIE NAMED HER MANAGED TO ROUND UP TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND AND SEVENTY EIGHT MAGPIE
SHE WOULD BE A VERY PERSUASIVE LITTLE BIRD WHEN SHE WANTED
<br>
A WEEK LATER DESPITE HOW MUCH FLAPPING THEY WERE STILL TRYING TO GET THE ROCKET IN THE AIR
IT TURNS OUT THAT THE OWL DIDN'T TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION THAT ONCE YOU GET OVER ONE THOUSAND MAGPIE TOGETHER THEY TEND TO FIGHT AND CAN'T AGREE ON A SINGLE THING
NOW WHILE ALL THIS WAS GOING ON WHAT DO YOU SUPPOSED FRED WAS DOING
HE WAS FEEDING THE PANDAS LIKE HE WAS SUPPOSED TO
ONE DAY AFTER FRED HAD FED THE PANDAS AND WAS HUGGING THE PALM TREE THE ZOO MANAGER CAME UP TO HIM AND SAID WHAT IS GOING ON WITH YOUR PANDAS FRED I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT
IT'S TAKEN ME A COUPLE OF WEEKS TO FIGURE IT OUT BUT I THINK YIN YIN WANTS TO GO TO THE MOON AND THE MAGPIES WANT TO TAKE HER THERE SAID FRED
OH WELL THAT MAKES SENSE THEN THE MAN SAID THE MANAGER
THIS IS JUST THE TYPE OF EXPOSURE WE NEEDED THOSE PANDAS WILL BE WITH US FOR A LONG TIME
SIL
FRED THOUGHT ABOUT FRED THOUGHT ABOUT IT AND SAID YOU THINK WE SHOULD RENAME YIN YIN COLUMBUS
THE ZOO KEEPER SAID GOOD HEAVENS MAN THAT IS A GREAT IDEA
NO WAIT A SECOND I DON'T UNDERSTAND
WELL SIR WHEN COLUMBUS SET OUT ON HIS SHIP HE WAS REALLY TRYING TO FIND A QUICKER WAY TO GET AROUND EUROPE IN ORDER TO IMPROVE TRADE
HE WANTED TO BE A BUSINESS MAN BUT INSTEAD BECAME A GREAT EXPLORER
<br> YES BUT WHAT DOES THAT HAVE TO DO WITH THE PANDAS AN MAN THE ZOO MANAGER SAID THE ZOO MANAGER WELL IT SEEMS TO ME SIR THAT YIN YIN WANTED TO BE A GREAT EXPLORER AND INSTEAD BECAME A BUSINESS WOMAN I SEE FRED
ONE MORE THING SIR ABOUT THOSE MAGPIES FLYING ABOVE THE PANDAS DO YOU THINK THAT THE ZOO COULD PURCHASE ME A LARGE SIZED UMBRELLA
SIL
BACK IN THE PANDA'S HOME THE MOTHER PANDA POO POO WAS VERY
SIL
PROUD OF HER DAUGHTER AFTER ALL IF IT WEREN'T FOR YIN YIN THEY WOULD HAVE HAD TO MOVE THEIR YELLOW UMBRELLA ALL SHE COULD SAY WAS NONSENSE
AS FOR YIN YIN SHE WAS VERY PROUD TO BE RENAMED AFTER A FAMOUS EXPLORER AND SHE AND MAGGIE NEVER STOPPED TRYING TO GET TO THE MOON
WELL I DON'T GET H WHY IT SAYS THE VERY UN BEAUTIFUL GIRL NAME COLUMBUS
SIL
<br> BASICALLY YIN YIN WAS TRYING TO GET TO THE MOON
AND YIN YIN THE PANDA BEAR
SIL
UHM WAS SHE'S TRYING TO GET TO THE MOON WITH HER FRIEND MAGGIE THE MAGPIE
UHM
SIL
BUT IT DOESN'T WORK THE FIRST TIME CAUSE THEY ONLY HAVE THREE MAGPIES SO
I THINK MAGGIE GOES TO THE OWL AND HE SAYS YOU NEED A WHOLE BUNCH OF UHM MAGPIES SO SHE GOES AND GETS HIM AND THEN UHM
SIL
THE
SIL
THEN
SIL
FRED THE PERSON WHO FEEDS THE PANDA BEARS
GOES TO THE ZOO MANAGER AND DECIDES THAT THEY SHOULD RENAME YIN YIN
SIL
COLUMBUS BECAUSE THEY'RE GETTING SO MUCH MONEY AND CHRISTOPHER COLUMBUS WAS TRYING TO FIND A FASTER ROUTE TO
SIL
EUROPE I THINK AND
SIL
UHM
SIL
HE WOUND UP MAKING A LOT OF BUSINESS AND SHE'S TRYING TO GET TO THE MOON BUT SHE MADE A LOT OF BUSINESS CAUSE EVERYONE WANTED TO BUY PANDA DOLLS
SIL
SO THAT'S BASICALLY WHAT THE STORY'S ABOUT

WHAT IF HE HAD THE BRAINS AND MILITARY SKILL AND ALL THAT SORT OF THING
SIL
YES SAID ANNE CANDIDLY I'VE HEARD THAT YOU AND HE WERE ENGAGED ONCE
HE HAD GENTLE AND REFINED FEATURES AND HIS VOICE WAS SOFT AND PLEASANT IN TONE
SIL
ONE WOULD SUPPOSE THAT THEY KNEW NOTHING AT ALL ABOUT SCHOOL FAIRS BUT THEY DO
SIL
AT PRACTICALLY THE SAME INSTANT THE THIRD SHOT WHISTLED FROM THE EAST
SIL
WORST DOSE I I EVER ENDURED AND I'D NOTHING TO DO BUT SWELTER IN THAT HEAT
A SHADOW THAT CHILLED HIS HEART SEEMED GRADUALLY TO FALL UPON HIM
SIL
IT NEVER OCCURRED TO HIM THAT SHE MIGHT BE CHANGED HERSELF
GOOD FRIEND SAID THE OTHER GENTLY I HAVE BUSINESS ELSEWHERE
SIL
THEREUPON I TOLD THE KING WITHOUT ANY RE REV R RESERVE ALL THAT HAD HAPPENED
SIL
HANS WENT UP AND DOWN THE STREET OF AMSTERDAM THAT DAY LOOKING FOR WORK
SIL
YES SAID BEN IMMENSELY RELIEVED TO FIND THAT NO OFFENSE HAD BEEN TAKEN
MEN REJOICED OPENLY HOPING THAT IT WOULD SPREAD AND SEND THEM
SIL
THE SHELVES WERE CROWDED WITH DUSTY UTENSILS OF ALL SORTS
SHE GATHERED UP THE MOSS AND THE REMAINS OF THE BEES WAX
HE HAS BROKEN NO WORD OF THE LAW OF THE JUNGLE
SIL
THAT'S A GOOD DOG ANYONE CAN TELL THAT
SIL
THE KING THOUGHT AND THOUGHT FROWNED HARD AND RUBBED HIS EAR
SIL
WHAT ARE THOSE FOOLISH BUNDLES IN THE BACK OF THAT SILLY CART
SIL
SIL
BUT I'M AWFULLY HUNGRY I WISH YOU'D GET ME SOMETHING TO EAT
MEN REJOICED OPENLY HOPING THAT IT WOULD SPREAD AND SEND THEM INTO CAMP
MARCO ONLY STOOD QUITE STILL AND LOOKED AT HIM WITH UNDERSTANDING AND GRAVITY
SIL
GREAT WAS THE INDIGNATION OF THAT NOBLE BIRD AS HE WATCHED THE SCENE BELOW
I THINK I'D SEE PEARLS AND DIAMONDS COME OUT OF THE GIRL'S MOUTH
SIL
SIL
THE PANDA
WHY DID THE PANDA WITH A BEAUTIFUL GIRL NAME YIN YIN HAVE HER NAME CHANGED TO THE VERY UN BEAUTIFUL GIRL NAME COLUMBUS
IT WAS FRED'S IDEA SO LET'S BEGIN WITH FRED
FRED FED THE PANDA BEARS THE TIGERS AND TURTLES
THE TURTLES WEREN'T SO BAD BUT AS FOR THE TIGERS HE WASN'T SO SURE
SIL
NO ONE COULD BLAME FRED REALLY FRED WASN'T A NAIL BITER SO BEGAN BEING EATEN WAS DEFINITELY NOT SOMETHING HE LOOKED FORWARD TO EACH AFTERNOON AT THREE O'CLOCK WHEN IT WAS TIME TO FEED THE TIGERS
FOR FRED WHEN IT CAME TO THE PANDAS HE HAD A WARM SPOT IN HIS HEART
ACTUALLY IT WAS EIGHTY FIVE POINT FIVE DEGREE SPOT ON HIS LEFT KIDNEY BUT THE POINT IS THAT HE WAS VERY FOND OF FEEDING THE PANDAS
THERE WERE THREE PANDAS AND THEY WERE KNOWN AS THE PAN FAMILY
THEY WERE IN ORDER OF CUTENESS YIN YIN THE YOUNG DAUGHTER POO POO THE MOTHER MOO AND MOO MAN THE GENTLE ALWAYS SLEEPY FATHER
MANY PEOPLE KNOW THAT PANDAS EAT BAMBOO A LOT OF IT
A LOT OF BAMBOO CAN CAN GET QUITE HEAVY SO BECAUSE OF THE PANDAS FRED BECAME VERY STRONG AND WAS IN TERRIFIC SHAPE BUT PHYSICAL FITNESS WAS NOT THE ONLY REASON THAT FRED LOVED THE PANDAS
THE OTHER REASON WAS THAT ANYONE WHO GETS WITHIN THREE FEET OF A PANDA AUTOMATICALLY FALLS IN LOVE WITH THEM
IT'S A LAW OF NATURE AT FURTHER DISTANCES PANDAS HAVE STRANGE ALMOST MAGICAL EFFECT ON HUMAN BEINGS WHICH MAKES US WANT TO HUG AND SQUEEZE THINGS
FRED WAS NOT ALLOWED TO ACTUALLY HUG THE PANDA BEARS SINCE THEY COULD BE DANGEROUS SO ALL THE OTHER PEOPLE AT THE ZOO WOULD KNOW THAT THE PANDAS HAD JUST BEEN FED WHEN THEY SAW FRED HUGGING THE RATHER UN CUDDLY PALM TREE OUTSIDE OF THE PANDA'S HOME
IT IS INTERESTING TO PO TO POINT OUT THAT THIS TIME THAT MORE STUFFED PANDA BEARS ARE SOLD AT THE ZOO GIFT SHOPS THEN ALL OF THE OTHER STUFF ANIMALS COMBINED
THIS CAN ALMOST CERTAINLY BE ACCOUNTED FOR BY THIS STRANGE ALMOST MAGICAL EFFECT THAT THE PANDAS POSSESS
BUT EVERYTHING WAS NOT ALL BAMBOO AND HUGS AT THE ZOO ONE MORNING FRED WAS FEEDING YIN YIN AND SAID OH YIN YIN I WISH THAT MORE PEOPLE WOULD COME TO VISIT THE ZOO
I KNOW I SHOULDN'T BE TELLING YOU THIS BUT WE MIGHT HAVE TO SELL YOU AND YOUR OTHER AND YOUR FAMILY TO THE BIG ZOO IN SAN
SIL
SAN ANGELES
SIL
IF WE DON'T GET MORE MONEY
SIL
IT'S NOT THAT YOU AREN'T SELLING ENOUGH STUFFED PANDA BEARS IT'S JUST THAT THERE HAVEN'T BEEN ENOUGH PEOPLE COMING TO SEE YOU IN THE FIRST PLACE I THINK WHAT THE ZOO NEEDS IS A GREAT ADVERTISING CAMPAIGN
FRED WAS STARTING TO FEEL UNCONTROLLABLE URGE TO HUG THE PANDA SO BEFORE HE RAN OFF TO HUG THE PALM TREE
SIL
TO HUG THE PALM TREE QUICKLY SAID IT COSTS SO MUCH TO FEED YOU PANDA BEARS I WOULD HATE IF YOU HAD TO LEAVE US A AFTER ALL IT'S THE ONLY HOME YOU KNOW
BESIDES IF YOU LEAVE I'LL GET TERRIBLY OUT OF SHAPE NOW IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME I NEED TO SQUEEZE SOMETHING BEFORE I SCREAM
SIL
BUT YIN YIN THE YOUNG PANDA WAS NOT LISTENING TO FRED SHE WAS TALKING TO HER BEST FRIEND MAGGIE THE MAGPIE ABOUT GOING TO THE MOON
YES THE BIG ONE IN THE SKY THAT IS MOST LIKELY NOT MADE OF CHEESE AND MOST CERTAINLY NOT MADE OF BAMBOO
<br> YIN YIN AND HER BEST FRIEND MAGGIE THE MAGPIE WHO LOOKED A LOT LIKE A PANDA IF
SIL
WHO LOOKED A LOT LIKE A PANDA WOULD LOOK IF A PAN IF PANDAS WERE BIRDS WERE DISCUSSING ABOUT GOING TO THE MOON
HER MOTHER AND FATHER KNEW WHAT THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT SINCE THEY HADN'T THOUGHT OR TALKED MUCH OF ELSE SINCE YIN YIN SAID I WANT TO GO THERE AND POINTED TO THE MOON
ENOUGH OF THIS NONSENSE SAID YIN YIN'S MOTHER POO POO
WHAT SORT OF NONSENSE IS THIS FOR A YOUNG PANDA BEAR GOING TO THE MOON INDEED
NONSENSE
SIL
IT'S IT'S YOUR JOB YOUR JOB IS TO BE CUTE SO PEOPLE WANT TO RUN TO THE GIFT SHOP AND BUY PANDA BEAR DOLLS

I DON'T THINK IT WILL TAKE THAT LONG TO ROLL THERE SAID YIN YIN
YIN YIN'S FATHER MOO MAN DIDN'T THINK IT WAS VERY PROPER OR WISE FOR A YOUNG PANDA BEAR TO GO ROLLING OFF TO PLACES WHERE THERE WASN'T ANY BAMBOO BUT HE WAS SUPPORTIVE OF HIS YOUNG DAUGHTER AND SHOWED HIS SUPPORT BY MAKE TAKING A NAP
BUT BEFORE HE FELL ASLEEP HE DID MANAGE TO SAY I BELIEVE ROLLING IS A DECIDEDLY ROUND ABOUT WAY TO GO
IF YOU I IF YOU MUST GO IT WOULD BE BEST TO FLY
NONSENSE SAID THE MOTHER I'M SO MAD I'M GOING TO LOOK AT THAT LADY OVER THERE AND MAKE HER WANT TO SQUEEZE HER SON'S SON CHEEKS
SHE SAID SPITEFULLY AN INSTANT LATER THE YOUNG BOY WAS HEARD SAYING OUCH MOM CUT THAT OUT I'M SORRY TO SAY BUT MANY A LITTLE BOY'S CHEEKS HAVE BEEN MADE RAW WHEN MOTHER POO POO PANDA WAS UPSET
SIL
YIN YIN WAS ALWAYS ONE TO TAKE GOOD ADVICE FROM HER FATHER AND LESS THAN A WEEK LATER YIN YIN AND MAGGIE HAD BUILT A ROCKET SHIP OUT OF BAMBOO
THIS BAMBOO BAMBOO WAS A VERY WORKABLE SUBSTANCE AND PANDAS TEND TO HANDLE BAMBOO A LOT
SO THEN ITSELF WAS NOT THAT ASTONISHING
AT LEAST TO YIN YINS PARENTS FRED SURE WAS IMPRESSED THOUGH
THE MAIN OBSTACLE IT TURNS OUT WAS GETTING THE ROCKET SHIP OFF THE GROUND
MAGGIE FIGURED THAT IF A THAT IF SHE AND THREE OF HER STRONGEST MAGPIE FRIENDS WERE EACH TO GRAB HOLD OF THE CORNER OF A ROCKET SHE COULD THEY COULD ALL FLY TO THE MOON SO THEY TRIED
ONE TWO THREE TO THE MOON THEY SAID TOGETHER PULLING IT WITH ALL THEIR MIGHT

SIL
SO MAGGIE FLEW TO THE OWL AND ASKED FOR HIS ADVICE OH WISE OWL I HAVE A QUESTION THAT I FEAR ONLY YOU CAN ANSWER SHE SAID
HOW DO YOU TURN YOUR HEAD ALL THE WAY AROUND WITHOUT GETTING A TERRIBLE PAIN IN YOUR NECK SAID OWL
NO HOW MANY MAGPIE'S WOULD WE N WOULD BE NEEDED TO FLY FOUR HUNDRED A FOUR HUNDRED POUND PANDA BEAR AND A ONE HUNDRED POUND BAMBOO ROCKET SHIP TO THE MOON SAID MAGGIE
THE OWL INSTANTLY REPLIED TWO HUNDRED TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND AND SEVENTY SIX GIVE OR TAKE TWO
A WEEK LATER MAGGIE MANAGED TO ROUND UP TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND AND SEVENTY EIGHT MAGPIE
SHE COULD BE VERY PERSUASIVE A VERY LITTLE PERSUASIVE BIRD WHEN SHE WANTED TO
A WEEK LATER DESPITE MUCH FLAPPING THEY WERE STILL TRYING AND TO GET THE ROCKET IN THE AIR
IT TURNS OUT THAT THE OWL DIDN'T TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION THAT ONCE YOU GET OVER ONE THOUSAND MAGPIE TOGETHER THEY TEND TO FIGHT AND CAN'T AGREE ON A SINGLE THING
NOW WHILE ALL THIS WAS GOING ON WHAT DO YOU SUPPOSED FRED WAS DOING WHY HE WAS FEEDING THE PANDAS LIKE HE WAS SUPPOSED TO
SAID WHAT'S GOING ON WITH YOUR PANDAS FRED I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT
IT'S TAKEN ME A COUPLE OF WEEKS TO FIGURE IT OUT BUT I THINK YIN YIN WANTS TO GO TO THE MOON AND THE MAGPIES WANT TO TAKE HER THERE FRED SAID FRED
OH WELL THAT MAKES SENSE THEN
SIL
SAID THE MANAGER DO YOU KNOW THAT SINCE THE ZOO'S PROFITS HAVE GONE UP FOUR THOUSAND PERCENT THIS IS JUST THE TYPE OF EXPOSURE HE NEEDED
THOSE PANDA WILL SH THOSE PANDAS
SIL
OH OH WELL THAT MAKES SENSE THEN THE MAN MANAGER SAID DID YOU KNOW THAT SINCE THE LITTLE PANDA BUILT THAT BAMBOO ROCKET SHIP AND THOSE MAGPIE'S STARTED FLUTTERING ABOUT THAT THE ZOO'S PROFITS HAVE GONE UP FOUR THOUSAND PERCENT
THIS IS JUST THE TYPE OF EXPOSURE WE NEEDED THOSE PANDAS WILL BE WITH US FOR A LONG TIME
FRED THOUGHT ABOUT IT AND SAID YOU KNOW I THINK W WE SHOULD RENAME YIN YIN COLUMBUS BUT THE ZOOKEEPER SAID GOOD HEAVENS MAN THAT IS A GREAT IDEA NO WAIT A SECOND I DON'T UNDERSTAND
WELL SIR WHEN COLUMBUS SET OUT ON HIS SHIP HE WAS REALLY TRYING TO FIND A QUICKER WAY TO GET TO GET AROUND EUROPE IN ORDER TO IMPROVE TRADE
HE WANTED TO BE A BUSINESS MAN BUT INSTEAD BECAME A GREAT EXPLORER
YES BUT WHAT DOES THAT HAVE TO DO WITH THE PANDAS MA PANDAS MAN SAID THE ZOO MANAGER
WELL IT SEEMS TO ME SIR THAT YIN YIN WANTED TO BE A GREAT EXPLORER AND INSTEAD OF BECAME
SIL
WANTED TO BE A GREAT EXPLORER AND INSTEAD BECAME A BUSINESS WOMAN
THE ZOO MANAGER LAUGHED AND WALKED AWAY BUT DID PATCH PURCHASE A FASHIONABLE YELLOW UMBRELLA FOR FRED THE NEXT DAY
BACK IN THE PANDA'S HOME THE MOTHER PANDA POO POO WAS VERY PROUD OF HER DAUGHTER
AFTER ALL IF IT WEREN'T FOR YIN YIN THEY WOULD HAVE THEY WOULD HAVE HAD TO MOVE FOR FROM
SIL
THEIR WONDERFUL HOME
BUT LATER WHEN FRED WALKED INTO THE PANDA'S HOME UNDER A HIS NEW YELLOW UMBRELLA ALL SHE COULD THINK TO SAY WAS NONSENSE
AS FOR YIN YIN SHE WAS B VERY PROUD TO RE BE RENAMED AFTER A FAMOUS EXPLORER AND SHE AND MAGGIE NEVER STOPPED TRYING TO GET TO THE MOON
UHM IT WAS ABOUT A PANDA WHO UNLESS THE ZOO DIDN'T MAKE ENOUGH MONEY THEY WOULD HAVE TO MOVE
AND THEN THE LITTLEST PANDA WANTED TO TRY TO GET TO THE MOON AND SINCE THERE WAS A BUNCH OF COMMOTION AND TH THEY WERE BUILDING A ROCKETSHIP MORE PEOPLE CAME TO THE ZOO AND THEY GOT ENOUGH MONEY AND THEY COULD STAY AT THE ZOO
SIL
THIS STORY WAS ABOUT A P A FAMILY OF PANDA'S
SIL
AND THE LITTLEST PANDA WAS NAMED YIN YIN AND UH SHE AND HER FAMILY WERE AT A ZOO AND THE ZOOKEEPER'S NAME WAS FRED
AND THE ZOO WASN'T MAKING ENOUGH MONEY SO IF THEY DIDN'T MAKE MORE MONEY THEN THEY WOULD HAVE TO MOVE THE PANDAS TO A DIFFERENT ZOO
AND FRED DIDN'T WANT THAT TO HAPPEN CAUSE FRED WAS THE ZOOKEEPER AND HE FED THE PANDAS
SO AND UH YIN YIN WANTED TO TRY TO FLY TO THE MOON SO SHE AND HER FRIEND MAGGIE THE MAGPIE BUILT A ROCKETSHIP AND GOT A BUNCH OF OTHER MAGPIES
TO HELP TRY TO FLY YIN YIN TO THE MOON
AND THEN BECAUSE OF THAT AND LIKE THEY THEM BUILDING A ROCKETSHIP OUT OF BAMBOO A BUNCH MORE PEOPLE CAME TO THE ZOO AND THEY GOT MORE MONEY AND THEY WERE ABLE TO STAY AT THE ZOO
