TIM LIKED TO GO OUTSIDE ON SUNNY DAYS HE LIKED TO FEEL THE COOL BREEZE HE LIKED TO HEAR THE WIND HE LIKED TO SEE THE WHITE PUFFY CLOUDS TODAY WERE RACING ACROSS THE SKY
CLOUDS NEVER STAY IN ONE PLACE TIM WONDERED

LAY SOME PEBBLES THE CROW PICKED UP
PICKED UP ONE
UP
AND LET IT FALL INTO THE PITCHER
HE HE DROPPED IN ANOTHER THEN
ANOTHER HE COULD SEE THE WATER

A LITTLE NOW HE WORKED HARDER
THAN EVER
SOON THE WATER WAS
HIGH ONLY
THAT HE COULD REACH IT

HI MY NAME IS CORY I LIKE RABBITS AND CATS AND DOGS I LIKE TO GO ON WALKS IN THE MORNING IF IT'S NOT TOO CHILLY I LIKE THE SNOW AND GOING TO SLEDDING I REALLY DON'T LIKE SKIING I'M GOING TO A BIRTHDAY PARTY ON SATURDAY I MY BEST FRIENDS NAME IS HAILEY I HAVE TWO FRIENDS NAMES HAILEY I HAVE A GIRL IN MY CLASS WHO'S VERY NICE TO ME HER NAME IS CAITLIN I LIKE TO WRITE AND READ AND DO MATH MY FAVORITE SUBJECT IS WRITING IT
PICK THE CAT UP BUT SOMETIMES WE DON'T ALWAYS THINK
DEAR MOM AND DAD PARENTS SINCE YOU HAVE GROUNDED ME AND TOLD T ME TO WRITE DOWN WHY I AM SORRY BEFORE I WAS ALLOWED OUT OF MY ROOM I AM MAD AT YOU I WOULD L
LIKE
TO START BY SAYING THAT I THINK THAT YOU ARE VERY MEAN TO MAKE ME DO THIS BECAUSE IT WASN'T EVEN MY FAULT
I COULDN'T HELP IT ANYWAY IT WAS AN ACCIDENT AND I DIDN'T EVEN DO IT IN
IT ON PURPOSE
I REALLY DIDN'T MEAN TO SHAVE THE CAT REALLY I SWEAR
OK HERE'S WHAT HAPPENED AS I REMEMBER IT
I SAW THAT THE CAT WAS
PROUD OF ME
BUT FOR
FOR THINKING SO FAST ON MY TOES
OH SURE IT'S EASY TO SAY THAT I SHOULD HAVE JUST PICKED THE CAT UP BUT SOMETIMES WE DON'T ALWAYS THINK
ALL THAT GREAT UNDER PRESSURE
YOU AND YOU KNOW WHAT THE STUPID GERBILS DIDN'T EVEN
THANK ME THEY JUST RAN ON THAT STUPID WHEEL AND DID STUPID THINGS THAT'S THE LAST TIME I SHAVE THE CAT TO PROTECT ANY STUPID GERBILS
BESIDES THE REAL REASON I SHAVED THE CAT WAS TO KEEP IT NICE AND COOL
I JUST DIDN'T WANT TO SEE THE CAT GETTING ALL HOT AND UNCOMFORTABLE AND STUFF
YOU GUYS WILL JUST PROBABLY SAY IT'S WINTER DANNY
DANNY
CATS DON'T OVERHEAT IN WINTER
WINTER
BUT SO WHAT IF
IT'S WINTER
WINTER I
MEAN
IT'LL
BE SUM SOON SUMMER SOON ENOUGH AND
AL I JUST WANTED THE CAT TO GET USED TO THE IDEA BEFORE
IT GOT REALLY HOT
PLUS OSCAR MY TURTLE TOLD ME TO SHAVE THE CAT
FINE OSCAR CAN'T REALLY TALK BUT IF HE COULD HE WOULD S HAVE SAID
SAID PLEASE SHAVE THE CAT
CAT
IT T
KEEPS HITTING ME ON THE SHELL AND TRYING TO ROLL ME OVER
WHEN YOU LEAVE THE ROOM YOU GUYS NEVER
LIKED OSCAR AS MUCH AS THE CAT
ANYWAY
YOU WOULDN'T ALWAYS TAKE THE CAT'S SIDE IF YOU KNEW THE STUFF HE DID TO MY POOR TURTLE CAT'S AREN'T ALWAYS NICE JUST LIKE MY SISTER JENNY ISN'T ALWAYS NICE
I
I KNEW OUR CAT WOULD GROW HER FUR BACK BUT SOME CATS DON'T HAVE HAIR
THEY ARE CALLED HAIRLESS CATS AND THEY NEED FUR IN THE WINTER SOMETIMES I THINK I SWEAR THAT'S THE REASON ALSO I WAS GOING TO SELL THE CAT F FUR AND BUY MY SISTER JENNY BRACES FOR HER BIG STUPID FACE
PLUS
I FORGOT TO TELL YOU THAT YOU SHOULD BE BLAMING MRS CAS MRS
CAS
PER
MY SCIENCE TEACHER SHE MADE US HAVE
SHOULD I STOP
SHE MADE US SHAVE SOMETHING FOR SCIENCE ASK HER
SHE SAID WHAT THAT WHEN WE SHOULD SHAVE HAIR IT GROWS BACK HARDER AND SOMETIMES EVEN DARKER SO I THOUGHT THAT IF I COULD SHAVE THE CAT A LOT OF A BUNCH OF TIMES HER HAIR WOULD GROW BACK HARDER
BACK HARDER EACH TIME AND SOON
SHE WOULD HAVE AN
IN
IN
V
S INVINCIBLE COAT
OF CAT FUR ARMOR THEN SHE WOULD BE A SUPER CAT AND YOU
COULD TAKE HER
ON T V SHOWS AND GET LOTS OF MONEY SO THAT YOU CAN SEND JENNY TO
COLLEGE EVEN IF SHE IS A DUMB LITTLE TATTLE TALE SHE'S SO GOOD AT SCHOOL YOU
SCHOOL AND YOU BROUGHT HER A CAT CAUSE SHE'S RESPONSIBLE AND STUFF
JUST CAUSE SHE'S G GOOD STUDENT
A GOOD STUDENT
DIDN'T MEAN SHE REALLY RESPONSIBLE
SHE'S REALLY RESPONSIBLE
LAST NIGHT I SAW THAT SHE DIDN'T BRUSH HER TEETH OH YEAH I FORGOT TO TELL YOU THAT
DEAR MOM AND DAD JENNY DIDN'T BRUSH HER TEETH LAST NIGHT I THINK THAT SHE SH
SHOULD BRUSH HER TEETH TWICE TONIGHT
THAT'S JUST MY
OPINION
OPINION THOUGH I'LL BET YOU DIDN'T KNOW SOMETHING ELSE
ELSE DID YOU KNOW THAT I WANTED TO BE A BARBER
I WAS AFRAID TO TELL YOU REALLY
REALLY RE
THE REALLY REASON I SHAVED THE CAT
CAT WAS THAT I WANT TO BE A BARBER AND I NEEDED PRACTICE I WAS AFRAID YOU WOULDN'T LET ME PRACTICE ON MY OWN HEAD CAN I PRACTICE BY SHAVING JENNY'S HEAD I PROMISE THAT
I'LL DO A BETTER JOB THEN I DID ON THE
CAT CAUSE
NOW I HAVE
WHAT DAD CALLS LIFE EXPERIENCE NOT THAT I SHAVED THE CAT THOUGH
ACTUALLY THE TRUTH IS THAT
I
I BE
ACCIDENT TURNED ON THE NOSE HAIR CLIPPERS AND THE
CAT WAS BEING CHASED BY THE TURTLE AND RAN RIGHT BY THE SLIP CLIPPERS AND SHAVED HER OFF SELF I KEPT SAYING NO KITTY NO DON'T HAVE SHAVE YOURSELF BUT MY STUPID SISTER NEVER TAUGHT HER
CAT NOW HOW TO LISTEN SO SHE JUST IGNORED ME
IGNORED ME SEE SHE'S NOT
IF I HAD A CAT I WOULD TEACH IT TO
NOT SHAVE IT ITSELF
THAT'S
FOR SURE I DON'T HAVE TO GET GOOD GRADES TO KNOW THAT YOU SHOULD TEACH A CAT TO SHAVE ITSELF
PLUS
IT W
PLUS IF YOU WEREN'T ALWAYS
CUDDLING WITH MY SISTER
SO MUCH MAYBE SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN WITH HER CAT INSTEAD THE CAT CAME INTO MY
MY ROOM BECAUSE JENNY NEVER PLAYS WITH IT ANY
ENOUGH
THE CAT LIKED BEING SHAVED
ANYWAY SO I DID DON'T SEE THE BIG DEAL
I THINK IT REALLY LIKED ITS HAIRCUT THE ONLY REASON IT HASN'T COME
OUT FOR TWO WEEKS IS BECAUSE YOU GUYS MADE SUCH A BIG DEAL ABOUT IT POOR KITTY SH THIS
THIS AND POOR KITTY THAT
IT'S YOUR FAULT REALLY DAD PLEASE DON'T READ THE NEXT PART
DEAR MOM
DON'T LET DAD KNOW THAT
THE REAL REASON I SHAVED THE CAT WAS THAT HE'S ALWAYS SNEEZING AROUND IT
I KNEW
HOW MUCH
YOU HATE
HIM
ALWAYS SNEEZING AND STUFF SO I THOUGHT IF
I GOT RID OF HER FUR SHE
FUR HE WOULDN'T SNEEZE AND THAT
YOU WOULD HAVE A BETTER MARRIAGE
SO
IT WAS REALLY MY FATHER'S DAY GIFT TO HIM SO I COULDN'T BUY HIM ANYTHING NICE SINCE YOU TOOK AWAY MY ALLOWANCE FOR WHEN I SHAVED THE NEIGHBOR'S DOG
HOW COME JENNY'S JENNY GETS A CAT AND I
GET A STUPID TURTLE ANYWAY
ANYWAY TURTLES DON'T DO ANYTHING EXCEPT POKE THEIR HEADS OUT AND
BE
NOT CUDDLY
HEADS OUT AND BE NOT CUDDLY CAN I GET A DOG PLEASE
S
SO I
SO IN CONCLUSION I'M GETTING HUNGRY AND I'M SORRY FOR SHAVING THE CAT
ALTHOUGH YOU CAN SEE THAT'S
THAT IT'S REALLY JENNY'S FAULT FOR NOT BEING AS RESPONSIBLE AS YOU'RE
AL
YOU ALWAYS SAY AND NOT BRUSHING HER TEETH P S IF YOU WOULD HAVE BROUGHT HER A TURTLE I COULDN'T HAVE SHAVED IT SINCERELY DANNY
THAT HE'S TRYING TO BLAME IT ON SOMEBODY DANNY'S TRYING TO BLAME IT ON S THE HIS UHM THING THAT HE DID ON SOMEBODY ELSE
SIL
I THINK
SIL
AND
SIL
HE'S SAYING THAT HER SISTER HE'S SAYING THAT HER SISTER HIS SISTER ISN'T UHM THAT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CAT OR BRUSHING HER TEETH

SO HIS
OWNERS
NAMED
HIM
FLEABAG
HE SOON
LEARNED THAT
WHENEVER HIS OWNER SAID
FLEABAG COME HE WOULD
SOMETIMES GET A
YUMMY TREAT
THAT WAS A LONG TIME AGO
WHEN FLEABAG WAS HAPPY
HE WAS OLDER
NOW AND HAD
PROBLEMS WITH HIS
BACK LEGS
THAT MADE
HIM
LIMP
LIMP WHEN HE RAN
BUT THAT DIDN'T
STOP HIM FROM
RUNNING
LIKE MOST DOGS HE
LOVED TO RUN
THERE WAS A DOG
PARK
NEAR WHEN HE
LIVED
WHERE HE LIVED
HE
ENJOYED
PLAYING WITH THE
OTHER DOGS BECAUSE
HE DIDN'T
HAVE T HAVE HAVE TO
BE ON HIS L
LEASH AT THE
DOG PARK
THERE WAS
ONE DOG NAMED
THAT WOULD ALWAYS
COME
UP TO
FLEABAG
AND
BIT
BITE HIS BACK
LEG AND
RUN AWAY
SAYING BARK BARK BARK

FLEABAG
WOULD ALWAYS
CHASE
SNOT
BUT COULDN'T EVER CATCH HIM
HA
ONE DAY FLEABAG
WENT
TO THE
VET
FLEABAG DIDN'T
MIND THE VET BECAUSE
ACTUALLY
USUALLY THE
PEOPLE IN THE
WHITE
COATS
GAVE HIM TREATS
FLEABAG WAS AT THE
VET TO HAVE
SURGERY ON HIS LEGS
WHEN HE
AWOKE FROM THE
SURGERY HE DIDN'T
REMEMBER WHERE HE WAS BUT
HE SURE
DIDN'T DID
WANT TO SEE
HIS OWNERS
SOON
THEY CAME AND
PICKED HIM UP
AND DROVE HIM HOME
FLEABAG
SUDDENLY
REALIZED THAT HE HIS
LEGS
ITCHED VERY
BADLY
HE
THOUGHT
OH BOY
I'M GOING
TO
LIKE MY LEGS
SO
HARD
THAT
THE ITCHING IS GOING TO GO AWAY
SO HE
TURNED
HIS HEAD AROUND
TO
TO LIKE
HIS LEG
WHAT
TO LICK
TO LICK HIS LEGS
BUT THEY THERE
WAS A BIG
WHITE THING
IN
THE WAY
HE SAW
WEARING
WEARING A
COLLAR
THAT MADE IT
IMPOSSIBLE
TO LICK HIS
LEGS
THE NEXT DAY HE WAS
WALKING WITH HIS
OWNERS
ON HIS LEGS
AND THEY WENT TO
THE DOG PARK
HIS OWNERS
WOULDN'T LET
FLEABAG PLAY
WITHOUT HIS LEASH
SIGNS
HE STILL
NEEDED TO
HEAL BUT
IT WAS
NICE
TO SEE ALL
HIS
FRIENDS
MEAN OLD SNOT
SAID BARK BARK BARK BARK
WHICH
MEANS IN

WHY DO YOU HAVE

EVENTUALLY
FLEABAG GOT
TO
TALK
TO COLLAR
OF
OFF
GOT TO TAKE HIS
TO TAKE THE COLLAR OFF BUT
BY WHEN
THE LEGS DIDN'T
ITCH
SO HE DIDN'T WANT TO LICK
WANT TO

THEM
FOR SIX WEEKS
HE WOULD TAKE
WALK
HE WOULD TAKE WALKS
AND GO
TO THE
DOG PARK BUT HE
COULDN'T BE
LET OFF HIS

ONE DAY HE TOOK A WALK

AS THEY WALKED THROUGH THE CENTER HE TOLD VICTOR AND TOMMY A STORY ABOUT A SUPER SPIDER THAT SPUN GIANT WEBS AND TRICKED BIGGER ANIMALS
NOW NOW VICTOR WAS MORE CURIOUS THAN EVER ABOUT SPIDERS
I'VE GOT JUST THE BOOK FOR YOU MR

HEY WOULD YOU LIKE TO GO ON A SPIDER HUNT TOMORROW OH YES VICTOR AND TOMMY SHOUTED

MR FOSTER SMILED WHY DON'T YOU CHECK IN THE BOOK TO SEE WHAT KIND OF SPIDER IT IS YOU DON'T WANT TOUCH AN ANIMAL OR PLANT UNTIL YOU KNOW IT'S HARMLESS TOMMY AND VICTOR STUDIED THE SPIDER BOOK IT'S A FUNNEL WEAVER VICTOR SAID AT LAST NOT A BLACK WIDOW
BLACK WIDOWS DON'T MAKE WEBS LIKE THIS VERY GOOD SAID MR FOSTER FUNNEL WEAVERS ARE VERY ARE NON POISONOUS THE BOYS AND MR FOSTER WATCHED THE SPIDER FOR SEVERAL MINUTES THEN MR FOSTER HAD TO LEAVE AS SOON AS MR FOSTER LEFT VICTOR HAD GOT AN IDEA QUICK HE SAID TO TOMMY RUN BACK TO THE HOUSE
MOM DAD VICTOR SHOUTED WHEN THEY ARRIVED I FOUND A SPIDER IN THE GRASS MY KEEP IT
I WANNA
WATCH AND IT TO SEE HOW IT LIVES
IT'S A HOLD ON SAID DAD WH WHERE WILL YOU KEEP IT IN THE OLD AQUARIUM VICTOR REPLIED
OK VICTOR SAID MR GARCIA A SPIDER WILL BE FUN TO WATCH BUT YOU MUST TAKE CARE OF IT AND FEED IT THE BOYS WENT OUT WITH MR GARCIA TO THE BARN AND FOUND THE AQUARIUM THEY COVERED THE BOTTOM WITH MOSS GRASS AND STONES THEY COVERED THE TOP WITH A WIRE SCREEN
THEN THE BOYS RETURNED TO THE ORCHARD TO CAPTURE THE SPIDER VICTOR
VIC VICTOR CAREFULLY
CARE VICTOR CARRIED THE SPIDER TO THE HOUSE IN A SHOEBOX THEN HE CAREFULLY TIPPED O THE BOX OVER
AND THE SPIDER FELL SOFTLY ONTO THE MOSS INSIDE THE AQUARIUM YOU KNOW WHAT TOMMY VICTOR SAID I THINK I'LL CALL MY SPIDER CLARENCE CLARENCE THE SUPER SPIDER SAW
A WEEK A WEEK LATER VICTOR SAW CLARENCE GUARDING A CURIOUS ROUND OBJECT HIDDEN
HIDING HIDDEN BETWEEN SOME STONES VICTOR LOOKED AT IT THROUGH HIS HAND LENS WHAT IS THIS HE WONDERED
VICTOR SEARCHED THROUGH HIS S SPIDER BOOK UNTIL HE FOUND A PICTURE SOMETHING
THAT LOOKED LIKE THE OBJECT CLARENCE WAS GUARDING
BY COMPARING ITS SHAPE AND SIZE TO THE PICTURE VICTOR DISCOVERED THAT IT WAS AN EGG SAC
THE BOOK EXPLAINED THAT
THE SAC FORMS OF
AFTER A FEMALE SPIDER MATES
MY SPIDER MUST HAVE MATED WITH A MALE SPIDER BEFORE I FOUND HER THOUGHT VICTOR I'LL HAVE TO SHOW THIS TO TOMMY AND TELL HER MY SPIDER IS NOT A CLARENCE IT'S A CLARA
WHEN VICTOR RETURNED WITH TOMMY HE SAW CLARA CLINGING TO THE EGG SAC THE BOYS WAITED BUT CLARA DIDN'T MOVE
TOMMY LOOKED CLOSER OH NO VICTOR I THINK SHE'S DEAD
THE BOOK SAID THE SPIDER WOULD DIE AFTER IT LAID ITS EGG SAC VICTOR SAID SADLY BUT I HOPED IT WOULDN'T HAPPEN TO CLARA

WINTER CAME AND PASSED ONE SPRING DAY VICTOR WAS SEARCHING FOR A WATERING CAN IN THE BARN HE GLANCED SADLY AT CLARA'S CAGE THAT HE AND TOMMY HAD LEFT THERE
LAST FALL CLARA'S WEB WAS COVERED WITH
HUNDREDS OF TEENY TINY WHITE BEADS
AND THE BEADS WERE MOVING VICTOR RAN TO THE HOUSE GRABBED HIS HAND LENS AND RETURNED TO THE BARN WHEN HE LOOKED THROUGH THE HAND LENS HE SAW THAT THE BEADS WERE SHAPED LIKE SPIDERS
THE BABY SPIDERS HAVE HATCHED FROM THE EGG SAC VICTOR SAID I'D BETTER TELL TOMMY
A WEEK PASSED VICTOR
LEARNED FROM THE SPIDER BOOK THAT THE SPIDERS HAD GROWN BIG ENOUGH TO TAKE CARE OF THEMSELVES
HE ALSO KNEW WHAT HE HAD TO DO HE PICKED UP THE AQUARIUM CARRIED IT OUTSIDE HE REMOVED THE SCREEN FROM THE TOP OF THE AQUARIUM SO SPIDERS COULD LEAVE GOODBYE LITTLE SPIDERS HE SAID IT'S TIME FOR YOU START A NEW LIFE SOMEWHERE ELSE
WHEN VICTOR CAME HOME FROM SCHOOL
THE NEXT DAY HE RAN STRAIGHT TO THE BARN
THE LITTLE SPIDERS HAD GONE VICTOR SADLY WATCHED
WALKED BACK TO THE HOUSE VICTOR YOU DID THE RIGHT THING MRS GARCIA SAID YOU MADE A PROPER HOME FOR CLARA AND TOOK VERY GOOD CARE OF HER

VERY
YOUNG
I'M
FRIGHTENED
THREE SEVEN TWO
THREE <unk> SEVEN TWO THREE
<unk> TWO I THINK
BEFORE I TELL YOU HOW ROOSTER JOHN GOT HIS NAME YOU SHOULD KNOW A LITTLE BIT ABOUT
THE TOWN OF FRANKSVILLE
FRANKSVILLE WAS A TOWN THAT SEEMED TO HAVE A PROBLEM AFTER
THE OTHER
THEIR PROBLEMS STARTED WHEN THEY RAN OUT OF WATER
THANKFULLY SOMEONE WAS DIGGING A HOLE
AND FOUND WATER
BUT SOON AFTER THAT THEY STARTED TO GET FILES
FLIES
THEY GOT TONS AND TONS OF FLIES
THEN
THEN THEY
THEN THE FLIES STOPPED
BUT JUST THEN A MAN MOVED INTO TOWN WHO PLAYED THE FLUTE SO BADLY THAT PEOPLE WOULD RUN AWAY SCREAMING
MAYBE A POORLY PLAYED FLUTE DOESN'T SOUND THAT BAD
BUT JUST TRY TO IMAGINE SOMEONE SCRATCHING AND
AT
SCRATCHING A CHALKBOARD WITH A FORK AND THEN
MULTIPLY
MULTIPLY THAT THAT TIMES A HUNDRED
THAT'S HOW THE FLUTE SOUNDED WHEN THIS GUY PLAYED IT
I'M I'M SERIOUS STILL I IT'S NOT AS
BAD AS MILLIONS OF FLIES I SUPPOSE
THAT THE BAD FLUTE PAYER PLAYER WAS ROOSTER JOHN
HE WASN'T CALLED ROOSTER JOHN YET
THAT CAME LATER
WHEN
HE KNEW HE WAS THE NEW TOWN DENTIST
NEW WAS AN EXCELLENT DENTIST BUT HIS REAL LOVE WAS MUSIC
HE PLAYED MANY MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS SUCH AS THE GUITAR
THE TUBA AND THE PIANO AND THE CLARINET
HOWEVER FOR SOME
REASON
HE ALWAY
THE WAY HIS MOUTH WAS SHAPED
HE
SHAPED
SHAPED MADE A FUNNY MADE HAS FLUTE SOUND FUN AWFUL
WE CAN'T LET YOU PLAY THE FLUTE ANYMORE JOHN
SAID THE POLICE MUCH SHERIFF SANDERS
THE NEIGHBORS ARE COMPLAINING
HE AND THE CATS AND DOGS ARE TRYING TO CHEW OFF THEIR EARS
BUT I HAVE TO PLAY I WAS BORN TO DO IT
I DON'T KNOW WHY
DON'T KNOW WHY BUT I FEEL LIKE I HAVE
TO OR ELSE BAD THINGS WILL HAPPEN
LOOK JOHN I'VE HEARD YOU PLAY THE CLARINET
YOU'RE QUITE GOOD
WHY DON'T YOU
PLAY THAT INSTEAD SAID SHERIFF SANDERS
OH THAT'S A NICE INSTRUMENT BUT IT'S NOT BUT IT'S JUST NOT THE FLUTE
I EVEN WROTE A S YOU A SONG
SHERIFF SANDERS
IT'S CALLED COPS AND ROBBERS
THEN HE PLAYED THE SONG THE POLICE CHAIR SHERIFF
HATED THE SOUND SO MUCH THAT HE THREW JOHN IN JAI
BUT THEY COULDN'T KEEP
JOHN IN JAIL SINCE HE WASN'T REALLY BREAKING ANY LAWS SO THERE WAS NOTHING THE POLICE COULD DO BESIDES EVERY
EVERYBODY LOVED JOHN SINCE THE SINCE HE HAD BECOME
THE TOWN DENTIST EVERYBODY'S TEETH WERE
MUCH WHITER AND CLEANER
AND HAD NO ONE
AND NO ONE HAD ANY CAVITIES
SO THE
SO THERE WAS A PROBLEM
IN THE LITTLE TOWN OF FRANKSVILLE
WHAT SHOULD THEY DO
THEY COULDN'T KEEP JOHN IN JAIL THEY
AND
THEY DIDN'T WANT TO KICK HIM OUT OF
TOWN BECAUSE THEY ALL HAD SUCH NICE TEETH
SO THEY DECIDED THAT JOHN COULD PLAY THE FLUTE AND EVERYBODY ELSE WOULD HAVE TO WEAR EARPLUGS
WELL I'M SURE YOU YOU GUESSED
THAT
DIDN'T THAT DIDN'T WORK
NO ONE COULD HEAR ANYTHING PEOPLE WERE GETTING INTO CAR ACCIDENTS AND EVERYBODY LOOKED REALLY SILLY AT DANCES
AT DANCES DANCING TO THE MUSIC THEY COULDN'T HEAR
JUST
THEY JUST COULDN'T
LEAD
A NORMAL LIFE
THEN THEY DECIDED TO
LOWER HIM DOWN
A WELL AND LET HIM PLAY DOWN THERE WHERE NO ONE COULD HEAR HIM
JOHN THOUGHT THERE THAT WAS
AN OK AN OK IDEA
BUT THERE WAS
AN
ECHO IN THE WELL THAT MADE THE FLUTE SOUND LOUDER
WINDOWS WERE BREAKING AND ALL THE COWS IN
IN TOWN STARTED MAKE TO MAKE MILK SOUR
LOCAL
THE LOCAL SCIENTIST DR WONG
CAME UP WITH AN IDEA
HE THOUGHT THAT IF HE MADE UP A NEW MOUTHPIECE ESPECIALLY SHAPED
FOR JOHN'S MOUTH
PERHAPS HE COULD PLAY THE FLUTE NORMALLY
AND GUESS WHAT
IT WORKED DR DR WONG
WAS THE TOWN HERO
THE FLUTE SOUNDED NORMAL
AND IT TURNED TURNED OUT JOHN COULD PLAY
IT QUITE WELL
THE PEOPLE IN THE TOWN DECIDED
T
TO HAVE
A GREAT BIG PARADE
IN FRANKSVILLE TO CELEBRATE THE FACT FOR ONCE THERE WAS NO PROBLEM
NO FLY
NO FLY PROBLEM AND NO AND THE FLUTE PROBLEM
AND NO FLUTE PROBLEM
DR WONG
AND
JOHN WERE
THE STARS OF THE PARADE THEY WERE UP ON THE MAIN FLOAT
BUT
IN A
A BIG BAND PLAYED AS THEY MARCHED UP
AS THEY MARCHED
UP AND DOWN THE MAIN STREET EVERYONE CHEERED
SOME THEN SUDDENLY A FLY LANDED ON
A LITTLE GIRL THEN A FLY
THEN A FLY LANDED ON SOMEONE ELSE
THEN SOME LANDED ON A BUNCH OF PEOPLE
PRETTY SOON TONS OF FLIES WERE LANDING ON EVERYBODY
BEFORE THEY KNEW IT THE TOWN WAS FILLED WITH FLIES AGAIN
OH NO CHIEF
S SANDERS SAID JUST WHEN A LITTLE WAS GOING GOOD FOR FRANKSVILLE
JOHN DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO
SO HE
JUST KEPT ON PLAYING HIS FLUTE
THE FLIES WERE ANNOYING SO HE HAD TO SWAT THEM AS HE
WITH HIS HAND OR EVEN HIS NEW FLUTE
HE STARTED SHAKING THE FLUTE TO GET THE FLIES OFF AND ACCIDENTALLY SMASHED IT INTO PIECES HE WAS VERY UPSET AT FIRST
THEN HE SAID OH WELL
GOOD THING I BROUGHT MY OLD FLUTE AS A BACK AS BACK UP
NO NO PLEASE
DON'T PLAY YOUR OLD FLUTE
BEGGED DR WONG
I BUT IT WAS TOO LATE JOHN HAD STARTED PLAYING
WHEN THE TOWNS
WHEN THE TOWNSFOLK HEARD THE
THE NOISE THEY COULDN'T EVEN SWAT FLIES ANYMORE
THEY HAD TO COVER THEIR EARS FROM THE HORRIBLE SOUND
THE FLIES WOULD LAND ALL OVER PEOPLE AND THEY COULDN'T SWAT IT OFF
THEY COULDN'T SWAT THEM OFF
IT WAS
GROSS SUDDENLY THE FLIES FLEW AWAY
AS FAST AS THEY COULD DR WONG
THOUGHT FOR A SECOND
THEN UHM PRONOUNCED
HIS
IT'S THE FLUTE SOUNDS THAT
THE FLIES HATE JOHN'S FLUTE PLAYING AS MUCH AS WE DO
JOHN THE DENTIST IS DRIVING THE FLIES AWAY
IT WAS THAT IT WAS THEN THAT
THE PEOPLE OF FRANKSVILLE REALIZED THAT THEY WOULD
HAVE
THAT THEY WOULD HAVE TO TAKE
THE GOOD WITH THE BAD
BECAUSE AS BAD AS THE FLUTE SOUNDED IT WAS A LOT BETTER THAN
THOUSANDS OF CRAWLING FLIES ON THEM
FROM THEN ON JOHN WOULD WAKE UP
AND <unk> STRINGS STRINGS OF
S
UP AT
<unk> LIKE A ROOSTER
TO PLAY
THE FLUTE
TO
TO KEEP
THE FLIES AWAY
AND SINCE THEY WERE DOWN ON WATER THEY COULDN'T HAVE THE FLIES TO EAT TO DRINK ALL OF IT SO THEY HAD TO KEEP SOME WAY AWAY FROM THE FLIES AND SO
THAT'S AND UHM THEY COULD KEEP THEM AWAY WITH THE FLUTE
UHM HE WAS ACTUALLY KIND OF THE HERO FOR IT AND UHM
SIL
HE JUST GETS TO UHM
HE JUST HELPS THEM ACTUALLY WITH
SIL
HE HELPS THEM WITH BOTH THINGS GETTING WHITE TEETH AND
UHM KEEPING THE FLIES AWAY

IT LOOKS LIKE A SPACE CREATURE
THAT SPIDER IS NO SPACE CREATURE BUT SHE IS DANGEROUS SAID MR FOSTER THE PARK RANGER
WHAT KIND OF S
SPIDER IS SHE ASKED VICTOR
BLACK WIDOW
MR FOSTER
ASKED ANSWERED
LET'S GO BOYS SAID MRS GARCIA
I'M SURE MR FOSTER HAS MANY OTHER INTERESTING THINGS TO SHOW US
MR FOSTER ENJOYED TAKING CENTER V
VISITORS THROUGH THE VISITORS CENTER AT THE STATE PARK
AS THEY WALKED THROUGH THE CENTER HE TOLD VICTOR AND TOMMY A STORY ABOUT A SUPER SPIDER THAT SPUN GIANT WEBS AND TRICKED BIGGER ANIMALS
NOW VICTOR WAS MORE CURIOUS THAN
THAN EVER ABOUT SPIDERS
I'VE GOT JUST THE BOOK FOR YOU SAID VICTOR
UHM
MR FOSTER SAID
IT IS CALLED SPIDERS FROM A TO Z
IT IS A GOOD BOOK TO BRING ON A SPIDER HUNT
MR FOSTER SMILED
HEY WOULD YOU LIKE TO GO ON THE SPIDER HUNT TOMORROW OH YES
VICTOR AND TOMMY SHOUTED
LIKE SLY HUNTERS THEY SNEAKED THROUGH THE TALL WET GRASS SOON VICTOR SPOTTED A FUNNEL SHAPED WEB IN THE GRASS
IN THE CENTER OF THE WEB SAT A SPIDER
YOU'D BETTER WATCH OUT VICTOR TOMMY WARNED IT MIGHT BE A BLACK WIDOW MR FOSTER SMILED WHY DON'T YOU CHECK IN THE BOOK TO SEE WHAT KIND OF SPIDER IT IS YOU DON'T WANT TO TOUCH AN ANIMAL OR PLANT UNTIL YOU KNOW IT'S HARMLESS
TOMMY AND VICTOR STUDIED THE SPIDER
BOOK
IT'S A FUNNEL WEAVER VICTOR SAID AT LAST NOT A BLACK WIDOW BLACK WIDOWS DON'T MAKE WEBS LIKE THIS VERY GOOD SAID MR FOSTER
FUNNEL WEAVERS ARE NON POISONOUS
THE BOYS AND MR FOSTER WATCHED THE SPIDER FOR SEVERAL MINUTES THEN MR FOSTER HAD TO LEAVE
AS SOON AS MR FOSTER LEFT
VICTOR GOT AN IDEA QUICK HE SAID TO TOMMY RUN BACK TO THE HOUSE
MOM DAD VICTOR SHOUTED WHEN THEY ARRIVED I FOUND A SPIDER IN THE GRASS MAY I KEEP IT
I WANT TO
TO WATCH
IT TO SEE HOW IT LIVES IT'S A HOLD ON SAID DAD
WHERE WILL YOU KEEP IT IN MY OLD AQUARIUM
VIC
VICTOR REPLIED OK VICTOR SAID MR GARCIA MR GARCIA
A SPIDER WILL BE FUN TO WATCH BUT YOU MUST TAKE CARE OF IT AND FEED IT
THE BOYS WENT WITH MR GARCIA
TO THE BARN AND FOUND THE AQUARIUM
THEY COVERED THE BOTTOM WITH MOSS GRASS AND STONES THEY COVERED THE TOP WITH A WIRE SCREEN
THEN THE BOYS RETURNED TO THE ORCHARD TO CAPTURE THE SPIDER
VICTOR CARRIED
OK
THE SPIDER TO THE HOUSE IN A SHOEBOX THEN HE CAREFULLY TIPPED THE BOX OVER AND THE SPIDER FELL SOFTLY ONTO THE MOSS INSIDE THE AQUARIUM
YOU KNOW WHAT TOMMY VICTOR SAID
I THINK I'LL CALL MY SPIDER CLARENCE CLARENCE THE SUPER SPIDER
A WEEK LATER VICTOR SAW CLARENCE GUARDING
A HOLD C CURIOUS ROUND OBJECT
HIDDEN BETWEEN SOME STORY STONES
VICTOR LOOKED AT IT THROUGH HIS HAND
HAND LENS
WHAT IS THIS HE WONDERED VICTOR SEARCHED
THROUGH HIS SPIDER BOOK UNTIL HE FOUND A PICTURE OF SOMETHING THAT LOOKED LIKE THE OBJECT CLARENCE WAS GUARDING
BY COMPARING ITS SHAPE AND SIZE TO THE PICTURE
VICTOR DISCOVERED THAT IT WAS AN EGG SAC
THE
FEMALE BOOK EXPLAINS THAT
THE SAC
FORMS AFTER FEMALE
SPIDER MATES
THE MY SPIDER MUST HAVE MATED WITH A MALE
SPIDER BEFORE I FOUND HER SAID VICTOR
I HAVE TO SHOW MY TO TOMMY
IT
AND TELL HIM MY SPIDER IS NOT A CLARENCE IT'S A CLARA
THAT'S MY NAME
WHEN VICTOR RETURNED TO T
TOMMY HE SAW CLARA CLINGING TO THE EGG SAC
THE BOYS WAITED BUT CLARA DIDN'T MOVE
TOMMY LOOKED CLOSER OH NO VICTOR I THINK SHE'S DEAD
THE BOOK SAID THE S THAT THE SPIDER WOULD DIE AFTER IT LAID ITS EGG SAC
VICTOR SAID SADLY
BUT I HOPE IT WON'T HAPPEN TO CLARA
I GUESS SINCE SHE'S DEAD WE WOULD TAKE THE AQUARIUM BACK TO THE BARN
WINTER CAME AND PASSED ONE SPRING DAY VICTOR WAS SEARCHING FOR A WATERING CAN IN THE BARN HE GLANCED SADLY AT CLARA'S CAGE
THAT HE AND TOMMY HAD LEFT THERE FOR
LAST FALL
CLARA'S WEB WAS COVERED WITH HUNDREDS
OF TINY WHITE BEADS AND THE BEADS WERE MOVING
VICTOR RAN TO THE HOUSE GRABBED HIS HAND LENS AND RETURNED TO THE BARN
WHEN HE LOOKED THROUGH HIS
HANDS LENS HE SAW THAT THE BEADS WERE SHAPED LIKE SPIDERS
THE BABY SPIDERS HATCHED HAVE HATCHED FROM THE EGG SAC VICTOR SAID I'D BETTER TELL TOMMY
A WEEK PASSED VICTOR LEARNED FROM THE SPIDER BOOK THAT THE S SPIDERS HAD GROWN BIG ENOUGH TO TAKE CARE OF THEMSELVES
HE ALSO KNEW WHAT HE HAD TO DO
HE PICK UP THE AQUARIUM
AND CARRIED IT OUTSIDE HE REMOVED THE SCREEN FROM THE TOP OF THE AQUARIUM SO THE SPIDERS COULD LEAVE GOODBYE LITTLE SPIDERS HE SAID IT'S TIME FOR YOU TO START A L A NEW LIFE SOMEWHERE ELSE
WHEN VICTOR CAME HOME FROM SCHOOL THE NEXT DAY HE RAN STRAIGHT TO THE BARN
THE LITTLE SPIDERS HAD GONE VICTOR SADLY WALKED BACK TO THE HOUSE
VICTOR
YOU DID THE RIGHT THING MRS GARCIA SAID
YOU MADE A PROPER HOME FOR CLARA AND TOOK VERY GOOD CARE OF HER
AND NOW YOU HAVE GIVEN H
HER CHILDREN A CHANCE TO MAKE HOMES OF THEIR OWN AND HAVE MORE SPIDERS
VICTOR SMILED TO HIMSELF
HE THOUGHT ABOUT LAST SUMMER'S SPIDER HUNT AND ABOUT CLARA'S EGG SAC

JULIO
DID YOU HEAR
THERE'S GOING TO BE A RACE FOUR WEEKS
SAID
DRAKE TO HIS FRIEND

IN IT AND I'M GOING TO WIN
JULIO LAUGHED AT DRAKE AND SAID OH REALLY
PROVE IT
I'LL RACE YOU TO MY HOUSE AND
WE'LL SEE WHO WINS
READY SET GO SHOUTED DRAKE
THE TWO BOYS RAN AS FAST AS THEY COULD
AT FIRST THEY WERE RUNNING AT THE SAME SPEED
HE'S NOT IT GREAT
HE'S NOT SO GREAT THOUGHT JULIO BUT AFTER A WHILE DRAKE WAS
FAR AHEAD OF JULIO
DRAKE TURNED AND SHOUTED TOLD YOU
TOLD YOU
I'M GOING TO WIN THE RACE
YOU MIGHT AS WE
YOU MIGHT AS
WELL NOT EVEN SIGN UP JULIO
JULIO WAS MAD
HE COULD HARDLY CATCH HIS BREATH
HIS BODY FELT TIRED WHEN HE GOT HOME HE SLAMMED THE DOOR BEHIND HIM
WHAT'S WRONG
HIS BIG SISTER
ELENA ASKED THERE'S GOING TO BE A BIG RACE
DRAKE
DRAKE IS
GOING
TO BEAT ME
HE BEATS
ME AT EVERY
EVERYTHING JULIO SAID SALLY
ELENA HAD AN IDEA
WHY DON'T YOU TRAIN FOR THE RACE
HOW DO THAT JULIO ASKED
ASKED
COME
TO THE TRACK PRACTICE TOMORROW
YOU CAN TALK TO MY COACH I'M SURE YOU CAN
I I'M S I'M SURE SHE CAN HELP YOU SAID ELENA
THE NEXT DAY JULIO WENT TO SEE COACH BENSON
THE IF YOU WANT TO BE A BETTER RUNNER
THERE ARE THREE THINGS YOU SHOULD
DO SHE SAID
FIRST
YOU SHOULD RUN FOR FIFTEEN MINUTES EVERY DAY
HOW WILL THAT HELP ASKED JULIO
WHEN YOU RUN USED FOR A LOT
MUSCLES IN YOUR BODY EXPLAINED COACH
BENSON
YOUR MUSCLES AREN'T USED TO
R
USED TO RUNNING
IF YOU
IF YOU RUN A LITTLE EVERY DAY YOUR MUSCLES GET STRONGER
MUSCLES ARE
MUSCLES ARE
MUSCLES THAT ARE IN
MUSCLES THAT ARE
EXERCISED CAN WORK
LONGER
WITHOUT GETTING TIRED
OK SAID JULIO WHAT ELSE CAN I DO
IN A RACE Y
YOU NOT ONLY WANT TO BE
ABLE TO RUN AND GET TIRED YOU ALSO WANT TO RUN FAST SAID COACH BENSON
SO THE SAID
SO
SO THE
SECOND THING YOU SHOULD
DO IS
SOME
S
S
SPRINGING
SPRINTING
YOU SHOULD DO IT EVERY OTHER DAY DO YOU KNOW WHAT SPRINTING MEANS
DO JULIO
THOUGHT FOR A MOMENT HE HAD NEVER HEARD THAT WORD BEFORE
I DON'T THINK SO COACH HE SAID
PICK AT A SPOT THAT
IS NOT TOO FAR AWAY
RACE TO IT AS FAST AS YOU CAN
REST FOR A MINUTE THEN RACE BACK WHERE YOU STARTED
THAT'S WHAT SPRINTING MEANS
DO THAT FOR
FOUR TIMES EXPLAINED COACH BENSON
AND DON'T FORGET TO WARM UP BEFORE YOU RUN
THAT IS THE THIRD IMPORTANT THING TO DO YOUR SISTER
YOUR SISTER CAN
SHOW YOU HOW
JULIO LOOKED AT ELENA WHAT
DOES WARM UP MEAN HE ASKED WARMING UP MEANS DOING STRETCHING EXERCISES ELENA SAID
STRETCH YOUR MUSCLES MUSCLES THAT
HAVEN'T BEEN STRETCHED CAN GET HURT
IT IT IS ALWAYS GOOD TO STRETCH BEFORE RUNNING
OK BIG SISTER
SHOW ME THAT TO
SHOW ME WHAT TO DO SAID JULIO
FOR THE NEXT FOUR WEEKS JULIO WENT TO THE PARK EVERY DAY
TRAINING FOR THE RACE WAS NOT EASY
SOMETIMES HE
HE DIDN'T FEEL LIKE
RUNNING BUT HE MADE HIMSELF TO
HE ALWAYS STRETCH HIS MUSCLES BEFORE HE RAN
EVERY OTHER DAY JULIO WORKED ON HIS SPEED
HE COULD CHOOSE A TREE NOT TOO FAR AWAY AND RACE TO IT HE COULD REST BY COUNTING TO SIXTY
THEN HE WOULD RUN
BACK TO WHERE HE STARTED
THEN HE'D
HE
DO IT OVER AGAIN
EACH TIME HE
PRACTICED SPRINTING
HE THOUGHT OF
OF WHAT IT WOULD BE LIKE
WHEN HE BEAT DRAKE IN THE BIG RACE
AT FIRST JULIO FOUND IT HARD TO RUN HE WAS OUT OF BREATH
HE COULD FEEL HIS HEART POUNDING ON HIS CHEST
BUT
BUT AS THE DAYS
PASSED HE RAN
HE RAN LONGER AND FARTHER WITHOUT GETTING TIRED
HIS MUSCLES GOT STRONGER
THE
THE STRONGER HE GOT THE MORE HE COULD
COULD RUN
HE USED HIS WATCH TO TIME HIMSELF
AS HE KNEW WHAT
HE WAS GETTING FASTER
HE WAS HAPPY AT HOW HE
WAS DOING
NOW HE
RAN HIS
HE HE RAN HIS HEART BEAT STEADY
EVERY DAY HE WROTE DOWN IN HIS NOTEBOOK HOW MUCH HE HAD RUN
FINALLY THE DAY OF THE BIG RACE CAME EVERYONE IN SCHOOL WAS AT THE TRACK
THE RUNNERS LINED UP TO START
DRAKE TURNED TO JULIO AND SAID AND SAID I'M SURPRISED THAT YOU EVEN
YOU'RE EVEN HERE
I'M THE ONE WHO WILL WIN
WHO WILL WIN
THIS RACE
JULIO DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING
HE WAS TOO BUSY WARMING UP
AT LAST THE BIG MOMENT CAME
THE PRINCIPAL
OF THE SCHOOL CALLED
OUT ON YOUR MARK GET SET

THE RACE WAS ON
AS QUICKLY AS THEY COULD DRAKE
ANOTHER RUNNER
NAMED BETH TOOK THE LEAD SUDDENLY DRAKE STARTED TO SLOW DOWN
IT
HE WAS TIRED
OUT
OF BREATH AS THEY RACED AROUND THE TRACK JULIO SPED
PAST DRAKE
BUT BETH WAS THE ONLY RUNNER AHEAD OF JULIO
HE POURED ON THE SPEED
BUT SO DID BETH
NOW JULIO
UNDERSTOOD WHY THE COACH HAD TOLD HIM TO PRACTICE SPRINGING
AS THE TWO RUNNERS CROSSED THE FINISH LINE
JULIO BROKE THE TAPE
BETH WAS
WAS A CLOSE SECOND
JULIO
BEAMED
AT THE PRINCIPAL PLACED
THE PRINCIPAL PLACED A MEDAL AROUND HIS NECK

EVERY FOUR YEARS TURTLES FROM ALL OVER THE LAND WOULD CRAWL TO
A GREAT POND
IT WOULD TAKE SOME TURTLES FROM FAR AWAY VILLAGES TWO WHOLE
WEEKS JUST TO GET THERE
WHEN ALL THE TURTLES ARRIVED
THERE WAS A S
A SEVEN DAY FESTIVAL CALLED THE SHELL
DWELLERS
FESTIVAL WHERE THERE WAS LOTS OF EATING AND LAUGHING
TURTLES COULD CATCH UP WITH FRIENDS THAT HADN'T THAT THEY HAD NOT SEEN SINCE THE LAST FESTIVAL
EVERYTHING ABOUT THE FESTIVAL WAS FUN
BUT THE MAIN EVENT WAS THE
THE GREAT TURTLE RACE
THE WINNER OF THE GREAT TURTLES TURTLE RACE
WAS THE SO IMPORTANT THAT HE OR SHE DIDN'T HAVE TO MOVE
FOR FOUR YEARS UNTIL THE NEXT FESTIVAL
THE LESS
THE LESS A TURTLE MOVES THE BIGGER THEY GET AND THE LONGER THEY LIVE
SO YOU CAN SEE WINNING THE GREAT RACE IS A GREAT HONOR
THE TURTLE CUP
WAS THE OF THE TROPHY THAT THE WINNER WOULD TAKE TAKE HOME TO THEIR VILLAGE
IT HAD BEEN
IN
SLUDGE POND
O FOR OVER FIFTY YEARS BECAUSE NO ONE COULD EVER BEAT THEIR TURTLE
THIS A WAS THE MOST FAMOUS TURTLE THERE WAS
WAS THE SLOWEST TURTLE OF ALL TIME
HE HADN'T
HAD TO MOVE FOR
OVER FIFTY YEARS HE WAS THE BIGGEST MOST
RESPECTED AND ALSO ONE OF THE TRICKIEST TURTLES THERE WAS
THERE WERE MANY LEGENDS ABOUT HIM
RUMORED HE WAS SO SLOW HIS HEART WOULD ONLY BEAT ONCE A DAY
HIS NAME WAS MUD AND HE
AND HE WAS THE GREATEST CHAMPION IN THE HISTORY OF
THIS SHELL DWELLER'S FESTIVAL HE WAS UNBEATABLE
WHEN
WHEN MUD WAS IN HIS PRIME THERE WAS
A NEW TURTLE BORN IN BLUE POND
THIS TURTLE WAS NAMED SWISH
WHEN SWISH WAS BORN EVERYONE THOUGHT HE WAS A LITTLE SLOW BUT AS HE GOT A LITTLE OLDER THE TURTLES BEGAN TO REALIZE
THAT SWISH WAS REALLY REALLY SLOW
ONCE HIS MOTHER CALLED HIM
IN FOR DINNER AND
AND HE DIDN'T MAKE IT IT HOME UNTIL BREAKFAST THE NEXT MORNING
AND HE WAS ONLY A FOOT AWAY
BLUE POND WAS A NICE VILLAGE LOCATED ABOUT THREE DAYS CRAWL FROM GREAT POND
THEY ALL FELT A LITTLE SAD BECAUSE THEY HADN'T HELD IT THE TURTLE CUP IN OVER A
A SEVEN HUNDRED YEARS
SO WITH A S S WITH SWISH
THEY THOUGHT MAYBE JUST MAYBE HE COULD BRING BACK THE TURTLE CUP
TO THEIR LITTLE POND
EVERYONE TREATED SWISH DIFFERENTLY FOR EXAMPLE MR PEEKS
THE LOCAL SHELL CLEANER WOULD SAY HEY THERE SWISH DO YOU WANT A FREE SHELL WAXING
TODAY WE ALL WANT YOU TO LOOK GOOD WHEN YOU BRING HOME THE CUP
MRS SNAPPER WOULD SAY
HI SWISHY
DO YOU WANT SOME YUMMY PIE TO FILL YOU UP
UP AND SLOW YOU DOWN FOR THE BIG RACE
A FAT TURTLE IS
A SLOW TURTLE
MR SNAPPER
WAS NEVER NICE TO ANYONE BUT
SHE WAS BEING NICE TO SWISH MR PEEKS WOULD NEVER DO ANYTHING FOR FREE
BUT HE WAS GOING TO GIVE SWISH A FREE SHELL WAXING
THIS WAS THE KIND OF THING THAT SWISH WOULD GET ALL THE TIME
ALL THE EXTRA ATTENTION MADE SWISH VERY UNCOMFORTABLE
HE THOUGHT SURE
HE THOUGHT SURE THEY ARE NICE TO ME NOW BECAUSE THEY THINK I CAN
WIN THE RACE BUT IF I
LOSE THEY'LL BE DISAPPOINTED AND MAD AT ME
I'LL NEVER I NEVER PROMISED
PROMISED THAT
I WOULD WIN THE RACE
I CAN'T BEAT MUD ANYWAY I HEARD ONCE IT TOOK HIM THREE DAYS JUST TO YAWN
SO ONE DAY
HE TOLD HIS PARENTS I DON'T WANT TO RACE
ALL THE TURTLES IN BLUE POND HELD
A MEETING
TO DISCUSS THE PROBLEM
SAID THIS IS RIDICULOUS SWISH HAS A R TO RA HAS TO RACE HE'S THE SLOWEST TURTLE I'VE EVERY SEEN
EXCEPT FOR MUD OF COURSE WITHOUT HIM
WE DON'T HAVE
WE DON'T HAVE A CHANCE
BUT
HE DOESN'T WANT TO BE TREATED SPECIAL
HE JUST WANTS TO BE NORMAL AND HE DOESN'T WANT EVERYBODY
TO
HATE HIM IF HE CAN'T BEAT MUD
YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER
AT BEING SLOW HE'S STILL VERY YOUNG AND SWISH'S FATHER
L SAID SWISH'S FATHER
WE NEVER THOUGHT OF
ALL TH WE NEVER THOUGHT OF THAT
THEY ALL SAID THEY ALL SAID
WH THE TOWN AGREED TO S TREAT SWISH LIKE A NORMAL TURTLE AND AFTER A WHILE SWISH DECIDED THAT HE WOULD BE PROUD TO
RACE FOR HIS VILLAGE
WHEN THE TIME
OF THE FESTIVAL DREW NEAR ALL THE TURTLES IN
THE LAND STARTED TOWARD
THE GREAT POND SWISH HAD TO BE CARRIED
ON HIS FATHER'S BACK SINCE IT WOULD HAVE TAKEN HIM MONTHS TO GET TO GREAT POND BY HIMSELF
FINALLY AFTER THE LONG JOURNEY ALL THE TURTLES ARRIVED AT GREAT POND
THIS WAS SWISH'S FIRST
EVER SHELL DWELLERS FESTIVAL AND
HE THOUGHT IT WAS THE MOST WONDERFUL THING HE HAD EVER SEEN
THERE WERE THOUSANDS OF TURTLES OF ALL DIFFERENT SPECIES
ALL
HAVING A GREAT TIME
LOOK THERE'S YOUR COUSIN
PEEK A BOO FROM BIG PUDDLE VILLAGE
SAID SWISH'S MOTHER YOU'LL GET TO MEET ALL SORTS OF NEW TURTLES SWISH WAS SUDDENLY VERY EXCITED HE TOLD HIS MOM YOU KNOW WHAT
I'M GOING TO WIN THIS RACE I KNOW IT
AND ALL THESE TURTLES WILL KNOW THAT
BLUE POND RULES
I'M NOT AFRAID OF STUPID MUD
SWISH'S MOM SMILED AND SAID
I KNOW THAT
YOU CAN WIN SWISH BUT IT'S AN HONOR JUST TO
GET TO RACE SAID SWISH'S MOM
SWISH SAW A ROCK IN THE MIDDLE OF
THE FIELD IT AND WONDERED
HOW COME THEY DON'T HAVE
THAT BIG
ROCK OUT OF THE FIELD
IT SEEMED TO BE IN EVERYONE'S WAY SAID SWISH
THAT'S NOT A ROCK SWEETIE SAID HIS MOM

TRICKS
AND THEN HE WHISPERED IN SWISH'S EAR ALL THE TRICKS THAT HIS GREAT GREAT GRAND TURTLE TAUGHT HIM
AFTER SEVEN DAYS OF PLAYING AND DANCING

POSITIONS THE SLOWEST TURTLES
FROM EACH POND WERE CARRIED TO THE STARTING LINE BY MEMBERS OF THEIR VILLAGE
VILLAGES
THERE WERE CARRIED
BY
MEMBERS OF THEIR VILLAGES THERE WERE ABOUT THREE HUNDRED TURTLES RACING THEY WERE ALL THE SLOWEST OF THE SLOW
THE THE TURTLES ALL STRETCHED AND THOUGHT
REALLY SLOW
THOUGHTS AS THEY AS THEY DID THE SKY TURNED FROM BLACK
TO DARK BLUE
THEY LOOKED AT AT THE HORIZON AND SAW THE SUN WAS STARTING THE RISE
JUST THEN THE MAYOR SAID READY SET SLOW
AND OFF THEY WENT
ALL THE TURTLES WERE VERY VERY SLOW
SO IT LOOK
SO IT TOOK SOME TIME
BEFORE ANYONE COULD FIGURE OUT WHICH TURTLES WERE
THE SLOWEST
AFTER A FEW HOURS MOST OF THE TURTLES HAD GONE
A FEW FEET
ALL EXCEPT TWO SWISH AND MUD WERE STILL
WERE
WERE BOTH BOTH BACK AT THE STARTING LINE
IT LOOKED AS IF
NEITHER OF THEM HAD MOVED AT ALL
THEY WERE BOTH MOVING OF COURSE BUT
THEY WERE SO SLOW THAT IT WAS HARD TO TELL
AFTER SIX HOURS MUD AND SWISH WERE STILL TIED
AND HAD ONLY MOVED A FEW INCHES
BY NOW ALL THE TURTLES WERE USUALLY WAY AHEAD OF MUD
BUT THIS TIME SWISH WAS JUST AS SLOW
MUD KNEW THAT HIS WO
THAT THIS
WOULD BE HIS CLOSEST RACE EVER AND HE WAS
ACTUALLY GETTING A LITTLE BIT SCARED
WHO IS THIS YOUNG
PUNK
HE HE THOUGHT TO HIMSELF
MUD SAID TO SWISH THERE'S NO WAY THAT A TURTLE AS YOUNG AS YOU CAN
BE A SO SLOW
EVEN I WAS FASTER THAN YOU WHEN I WAS YOUR AGE
YOU'RE YOU'RE CHEATING
YOU'RE GOING TO RUN
RUIN THE GREAT RACE FOREVER
BUT SWISH WOULDN'T LET MUD SCARE HIM YOU'RE JUST TRYING TO MAKE ME QUIT I'M NOT GOING TO FALL FOR YOUR TRICKS HE SAID
TURTLES
NEVER CHEAT AND I'M
A TURTLE WITH HONOR
SAID MUD TRY
SAID THEN THEN MUD TRIED ANOTHER TRICK HE STARTED SINGING A SOFT BEAUTIFUL
S SONG
A SOFT BEAUTIFUL LULLABY
SWISH STARTED YAWNING HE WAS
TIRED FROM RACING
A AND THOUGHT THAT
IT WOULD BE NICE JUST TO LISTEN TO MUD'S SWEET VOICE AND FALL ASLEEP
THEN HE SNAPPED
OUT OF IT AND REMEMBERED HIS FATHER AND WARNED
HIMSELF
HIM
OF HIS OF HIS THIS TRICK
HE REACHED
ALL OF H H THIS HIS SHELL
AND PULLED A
OUT A COUPLE OF EARPLUGS
THE
THE
THE PUT
THE EARPLUGS
THE PUT DOESN'T MAKE REALLY SENSE BUT THE PUT THE EARPLUGS
IN HIS EARS AND COULDN'T HEAR MUD'S SINGING ANYMORE
MUD KEPT
SINGING HIS LULLABY FOR A FEW
HOUR HOURS BUT
BUT
HE STOPPED RIGHT BEFORE SUNSET
THE CROWD THOUGHT
HE MUST HAVE REALIZED THAT HIS SINGING TRICK WASN'T WORKING
BUT THEN RIGHT AS
THE END BE RIGHT BEFORE THE SUNSET SWISH STARTED TO PULL
AHEAD OF MUD
OH NO SHOUTED THE FANS MUD'S WINNING
IT LOOKS LIKE MUD'S MUD IS STILL THE GREATEST TURTLE OF THEM ALL AND WHEN
THE SUNSET WENT DOWN MUD WAS THE CLOSEST TURTLE TO THE STARTING LINE
SWISH WAS SAD THAT HE LOST BUT ALL
THE TURTLES FROM BLUE POND CHEERED FOR SWISH
THEY WERE VERY PROUD HE GAVE

PETS
TOM AND CHU WALKED BACK TO THE PET STORE
TOM LOOKED F FOR
FISH THAT
THE
TANK
WHERE F
THE TANK WHERE FULL OF ALL KINDS OF FISH
THEY WERE ALSO
FILLED WITH BUBBLES WHY DON'T YOU PUT BUBBLES IN THEIR FISH TANK
ASKED TOM
HE LOOKS LIKE THE FISH IS TAKING A BUBBLE BATH
IS
THOSE BUBBLES ARE FILLED WITH AIR
EXPLAINED MR CHU
FISH NEED TO BREATH AIR
JUST LIKE PEOPLE DO YOU KEEP
THE F
DO YOU KEEP
OUR FISH HEALTHY WE CLEAN
THEIR AIR AND WATER
WE USE IT
AN AIR PUMP TO FRESHEN THEIR TANK
THE AIR PUMPS
PUMP MAKES THE BUBBLES
HOW DOES THE WATER GET CLEAN ASKED TOM
THE AIR PUMPED
PUSH THE AIR PUMP PUSHES THE WATER THROUGH
AND AFTER
ANSWERED MR CHU
THE
FILTER WORKS LIKE A NET
AND IT
TRAPS THE DIRT
COLLECTS IN THE WATER
WHEN THE WATER COMES OUT OF THE
PUMP IT CLEANS
TOM
AND
TOM LOOKED AT THE FISH
BUT HE COULDN'T STOP THINKING ABOUT THE BUBBLES
MR CHU WHY ARE THE SOME BUBBLES BIG
WHY ARE SOME SMALL
SOME BUBBLES HAVE MORE
AIR IN THEM
THAN OTHER BUBBLES
A BUBBLE HOLDS AIR JUST LIKE A BALLOON SAID MR CHU
THE MORE AIR YOU BLOW
INTO A BALLOON THE BIGGER IT GETS
TOM LOOKED AT THE BUBBLES IN THE FISH TANK
MY
FISHBOWL DOESN'T HAVE AN AIR PUMP HE SAID
THERE ARE NO BUBBLES
OF
AIR IN THE WATER
IT'S WHY MY FISH ARE S
NO WHY MY FISH ARE SICK
MAYBE MR CHU
HOW OFTEN DO YOU CHANGE THE WATER IN THE BOWL
I HAVEN'T CHANGED IT SAID TOM
IF YOU DON'T USE A PUMP YOU MUST CHANGE
CHANGE THE WATER TWICE A WEEK
SAID MR CHU
WHEN YOU GIVE
YOUR FISH
FRESH IN THE WATER
THEY'LL START TO FEEL BETTER
THEY WILL GET PLENTY OF AIR TO BREATHE
THANK YOU MR CHU SAID TOM I WANT TO

DEAR MOM AND DAD PARENTS
SINCE YOU HAVE GROUNDED ME AND
TOLD
TOLD ME TO WRITE DOWN
WHY I AM SORRY BEFORE I WAS ALLOWED
OUT OF MY ROOM I AM MAD AT YOU
I WOULD LIKE TO START BY SAYING THAT I THINK
YOU ARE VERY MEAN
TO MAKING ME DO THIS BECAUSE IT WASN'T MY FAULT
I COULDN'T HELP IT ANYWAY
IT WAS AN A ACCIDENT AND I DIDN'T EVEN DO IT ON PURPOSE I REALLY DIDN'T MEAN TO S SHAVE THE CAT REALLY I SWEAR
OK HERE IS WHAT HAPPENED AS I REMEMBER IT
I SAW THE CAT WAS TRYING TO GET
THE GERBILS
AND YOU TOLD US WE COULDN'T HIT THE ANIMALS
SO WE DIDN'T
KNOW WHAT ELSE TO DO SO I GRABBED DAD'S
NOISE HAIR CLIPPERS AND SHAVED IT
YOU COULD
YOU SHOULD BE PROUD FOR
THINKING SO FAST ON
MY TOES
OH SURE THINKING
OH SURE IT'S EASY TO SAY THAT I SHOULDN'T HAVE JUST PICKED THE CAT
UP BUT SOMETIMES WE DON'T ALWAYS THINK
ALL THAT GREAT UNDER PRESSURE AND
AND YOU KNOW WHAT THOSE STUPID
GERBILS DIDN'T EVEN
THANK ME THEY JUST RAN
ON THAT STUPID WHEEL
AND
DID STUPID THINGS THAT'S WHY THE LAST TIME I SHAVE THE CAT TO PROTECT ANY STUPID GERBILS
BESIDES THE REAL REASON I SHAVED THE CAT WAS TO KEEP IT NICE AND COOL
I JUST WANTED TO
SEE THE CAT GETTING ALL HOT AND UNCOMFORTABLE AND STUFF
YOU GUYS WILL JUST PROBABLY SAY IT'S WINTER DANNY CATS DON'T
OVERHEAT IN THE WINTER
BUT SO WHAT
IF IT'S WINTER I MEAN IT'LL BE SUMMER SOON ENOUGH
AND I'LL JUST
AND I JUST WANTED TO
TO THE CAT TO GET THE CAT
USED TO THE IDEA BEFORE IT GOT REALLY HOT
PLUS OSCAR MY TURTLE TOLD ME TO SHAVE THE CAT
FINE OSCAR CAN'T REALLY TALK BUT IF HE COULD HE WOULD SAID PLEASE SHAVE THE CAT IT CAT IT KEEPS HITTING ME ON THE SHELL AND TRYING TO ROLL ME OVER
WHEN YOU LEAVE THE ROOM YOU GUYS NEVER LIKED OSCAR AS MUCH AS THE CAT ANYWAY
YOU WOULDN'T ALWAYS TAKE THE CAT'S
SIDE IF YOU KNEW THE STUFF
DID TO ME POOR TURTLE
CAT'S AREN'T ALWAYS NICE JUST LIKE MY SISTER JENNY ISN'T ALWAYS NICE
B
REALEST REASON I SHAVED THE CAT WAS
TO MAKE
A WIG FOR THOSE POOR HAIR L HAIRLESS CATS
THAT WE SAW ON T V
ON THE ANIMAL CHANNEL
I KNEW OUR CAT
WOULD GROW FUR BACK BUT SOME CATS DON'T
HAVE HAIR THEY CALLED HAIRLESS CATS
NEED FUR IN THE WINTER SOMETIMES I THINK
I SWEAR THAT'S THE REASON
I WAS GOING TO SELL THE CAT FUR
BUY
MY SISTER JENNY
BRACES FOR HER BIG STUPID FACE
PLUS I FORGOT TO TELL YOU
SHOULD BE BLAME THAT YOU SHOULD BE BLAMING
MRS
CASPER MY SCIENCE TEACHER
SHE MADE US SAVE SHAVE SOMETHING FOR SCIENCE ASK HER
SHE SAID THAT WE
WHEN WE SHAVE IT HAIR IT GROWS BACK
HARDER
AND SOMETIMES EVEN DARKER SO I THOUGHT IF WE COULD SHAVE
A CAT
A BUNCH OF TIMES HAIR WOULD GROW BACK
HARDER EACH TIME AND SOON HAVE AN INCREDIBLE COAT
OF CAT FUR ARMOR
THEN SHE WOULD BE SUPER CAT AND YOU COULD TAKE HER
ON T V SHOWS
AND GET LOTS OF MONEY SO THAT YOU CAN SEND JENNY TO COLLEGE EVEN IF SH SHE HAS
IS A DUMB LITTLE TATTLE TALE
SHE'S GOOD AT SCHOOL AND YOU BOUGHT
HER A CAT CAUSE SHE'S RESPONSIBLE AND STUFF
JUST CAUSE SHE'S A GOOD STUDENT DIDN'T MEAN SHE'S REALLY RESPONSIBLE
LAST NIGHT I SAW
THAT SHE DIDN'T BRUSH HER TEETH OH YEAH I FORGOT TO TELL YOU
THAT
DEAR MOM AND DAD JENNY DIDN'T BRUSH HER TEETH LAST NIGHT
I THINK THAT SHOULD BE BRUSH HER TEETH TWICE TONIGHT
THAT'S JUST MY OPINION
THOUGH I'LL OPINION THOUGH
I'LL LET
I'LL BET YOU DIDN'T KNOW SOMETHING ELSE
DID YOU KNOW THAT I WANTED TO BE A BARBER I WAS AFRAID TO TELL YOU A A REASON I SHAVED THE CAT WAS I WANTED TO BE A BARBER AND I NEEDED TO PRACTICE I WAS AFRAID IF YOU WOULDN'T PRACTICE
ON M
MY OWN HEAD I CAN PRACTICE BY SHAVING JENNY'S HEAD
PROMISE THAT I'LL DO A BETTER JOB THEN I DID THE CAT CAUSE I KNOW
CAUSE KNOW I HAVE
WHAT DAD CALLS LIFE EXPERIENCE NOT WHAT
THAT I SHAVED THE CAT THOUGH
ACTUALLY THE TRUTH IS THAT I BY ACCIDENT TURNED THE NOISE HAIR CLIPPERS AND THE CAT WAS BEING CHASED BY THE TURTLE
AND RAN RIGHT
BY THE CLIPPERS AND SHAVED HERSELF I KEPT SAYING NO KITTY NO DON'T SHAVE YOURSELF
BUT MY STUPID SISTER NEVER TAUGHT HER CAT
HOW TO LISTEN SHE JUST GOT IGNORED SHE JUST IGNORED ME
SEE SHE'S NOT SO RESPONSIBLE AFTER ALL
IF I HAD A CAT I WOULD TEACH IT
TO TO NOT SHAVE ITSELF
THAT'S FOR SURE I DON'T
HAVE TO GET GOOD GRADES
TO KNOW THAT YOU SHOULD TEACH A CAT TO SHAVE ITSELF
PLUS IF YOU WEREN'T ALWAYS
CUDDLING WITH MY SISTER SO MUCH MAYBE
YOU WOULD HAVE BEEN WITH HER CAT INSTEAD
THAT CAT CAME INTO MY ROOM BECAUSE JENNY NEVER PLAYS WITH IT ENOUGH
THE CAT LIKED BEING SHAVED ANYWAY
SO DON'T SEE THE BIG DEAL I THINK IT REALLY LIKED ITS HAIRCUT
THE ONLY REASON IT HASN'T COME OUT FOR TWO WEEKS IS BECAUSE YOU GUYS MADE SUCH A BIG DEAL ABOUT IT POOR KITTY
THIS
AND POOR KITTY THAT IS YOUR FAULT REALLY
DAD PLEASE DON'T READ THE NEXT PART
DEAR MOM A DEAR MOM DON'T LET DAD KNOW THAT I THE REAL REASON I SHAVED THE CAT WAS HE ALWAYS
IT
HE'S ALWAYS SNEEZING AROUND IT
N I KNOW HOW MUCH YOU HATE HIM ALWAYS SNEEZING AND STUFF SO I THOUGHT IF I GET RID OF THIS F
HIS FUR HE WON'T SNEEZE AND YOU WOULDN'T HAVE
OF
BITTER MARRIAGE SO IT'S REALLY M
MY FATHER'S DAY TO GI
FATHER'S DAY GIFT TO HIM
I COULDN'T BUY HIM ANYTHING NICE SINCE YOU TOOK
AWAY ALL MY ALLOWANCE WHEN I SHAVED THE NEIGHBOR'S DOG
HOW COME
A CATS GET
A CAT AND I GET STUPID TURTLE ANYWAY TURTLES DON'T DO ANYTHING EXCEPT POKE THEIR HEADS OUT
AND NOT BE CUDDLE
CUDDLY
I CAN GET CAN I GET A DOG PLEASE
T C
<unk> I'M GETTING HUNGRY AND I'M SORRY FOR SHAVING THE CAT
ALTHOUGH YOU CAN SEE IT'S REALLY JENNY'S FAULT FOR BEING AS RESPONSIBLE AS
YOU ALWAYS S S SAY AND NOT BRUSHING HER TEETH
P S IF YOU HAVE
IF YOU'D HAVE BOUGHT HER A TURTLE I COULDN'T
HAVE SHAVED IT
SINCERELY
DANNY
UHM IT SOUNDS LIKE DANNY GOT GROUNDED BECAUSE HE WAS SHAVING A CAT AND WHEN HE SHAVED THE CAT HE WROTE HE HAD TO WRITE A NOTE TO HIS PARENTS AND HE KEPT ON SAYING IT'S JENNY'S FAULT NO IT'S UHM YOUR FAULT NO IT'S THE CAT'S FAULT NO AND HE JUST KEPT ON TELLING IT SO THAT IT WAS ANOTHER PERSONS FAULT AND IT WASN'T HIS SO HE WOULDN'T BE GROUNDED

PALEONTOLOGIST ARE SCIENTISTS WHO STUDY FOSSILS THEY WORK TO UNDERSTAND WHAT LIFE ON EARTH
WAS LIKE MILLIONS OF YEARS AGO
MAYBE MY FOSSIL IS A BONE FROM A REAL DINOSAUR SCOTT THOUGHT
THAT NIGHT SCOTT DREAMED OF HUGE DINOSAURS TWO DAYS LATER SCOTT
CARRIED THE FOSSIL TO THE MUSEUM
DR LARUE
WAS A
PALEONTOLOGIST
WAS WAITING FOR THE CLASS SHE LED THEM INTO THE ROOM
FILLED WITH
SKELETONS OF DINOSAURS
DR WAS CAREFULLY OPENED SCOTT'S PAPER BAG
SHE TOOK OUT THE FOSSIL SHE LOOKED SURPRISED
AND EXCITED

WHEN HIS WHEN HIS OWNERS <unk> IT DOESN'T UNDERSTAND ME
WHEN HIS OWNERS FOUND HIM
AS A PUPPY HE WAS VERY DIRTY SO H
HIS OWNERS NAME
HIM
FLEABAG
HE SOON LEARNED THAT
WHENEVER HIS
OWNER SAID FLEABAG COME
COME HE WOULD SOMETIMES GET A YUMMY TREAT
THAT WAS A LONG TIME TO GO WHEN FLAG BAG
FLEABAG WAS A PUPPY HE WAS OLDER
OLD
OLDER NOW AND T
HAD PROBLEMS WITH HIS BACK LEGS THAT MADE HIM
LIMP WHEN HE RAN
BUT THAT DIDN'T STOP HIM FROM RUNNING
LIKE MOST DOGS HE LOVED TO RUN
THERE WAS A DOG
PARK NEAR WHERE HE LIVED HE ENJOYED PLAYING WITH
THE OTHER DOGS BECAUSE HE DIDN'T HAVE
TO BE ON HIS LEASH AT THE DOG PARK
SNOT
THAT WOULD
ALWAYS COME
UP TO FLEABAG AND BITE HIS NECK LEG AND RUN AWAY SAYING
BARK BARK BARK
BARK
WHICH IN DOGS
WHICH IN A
WHICH IN DOG TALK MEANS
YOU ARE TOO SLOW TO CATCH ME WITH YOUR LIMP
S
O I'M GOING
TO PICK ON YOU
FLEABAG WOULD ALWAYS CHASE SNOT BUT
WOULD NEVER CATCH HIM
ONE DAY FLEABAG WENT TO A VET FLEABAG DIDN'T MIND THE VET BECAUSE USUALLY THE PEOPLE
IN THE WHITE COATS GAVE HIM TREATS
FLEABAG WAS
AT
THE VET TO HAVE SURGERY ON HIS LEGS
WHEN HE AWOKE UP FROM THE SURGERY HE DIDN'T REMEMBER
WHERE HE WAS BUT HE SURE DID WANT TO SEE HIS OWNERS
SOON THEY
CAME AND PICKED HIM UP AND DROVE HIM HOME
FLEABAG SUDDENLY
REALIZED THAT HIS LEGS ITCHED VERY
BADLY
HE THOUGHT
OH BOY I'M GOING TO LICK MY LEG SO
HARD THAT
THE
ITCHING IS GOING TO
GO AWAY
SO H
HE TURNED HIS HEAD AROUND TO LICK HIS LEG BUT THERE WAS A BIG WHITE THING ON HIS WAY
HE WAS WEARING A COLLAR THAT MADE IT
POSSIBLE TO LICK HIS LEGS
THEN
THE NEXT DAY HE
WAS WALKING WITH HIS OWNERS ON THE LEASH AND THEY WENT TO THE DOG PARK
HIS OWNERS WOULDN'T LET FLEABAG PLAY WITHOUT
THE LEASH SINCE HE STILL NEEDED TO HEAL
BUT IT WAS NICE TO SEE ALL HIS FRIENDS MEAN OLD SNOT SAID BARK BARK BARK
WHICH MEAN
DOGS
DOG
WHICH MEAN IN DOG TALK
WHY DO YOU HAVE TO WEAR THAT STUPID LOOKING COLLAR
BOY DO YOU LOOK SILLY IN THAT UGLY COLLAR HA HA HA
EVENTUALLY FLEABAG GOT TO TAKE THE COLLAR OFF BUT
BY THEN THE
LEGS DIDN'T
ITCH SO HE DIDN'T
WANT TO LICK THEM
FOR SIX WEEKS HE COULD TAKE WALKS AND GO TO THE DOG PARK BUT HE COULDN'T BE LET OFF HIS LEASH
WHICH MADE HIM A LITTLE MAD
AT HIS OWNERS
ONE DAY HE TOOK A WALK TO THE DOG PARK AND ALL HIS FRIENDS WERE THERE
AS USUAL
VERY CAREFULLY
HIS OWNERS REACHED AROUND FLEABAG AND TOOK
HIS LEASH OFF
FLEABAG
DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO BECAUSE HE HAD BEEN ON HIS LEASH SO LONG
JUST THEN SNOT BIT HIM ON THE BACK LEG AND RAN AWAY
REALIZE
WHICH
MEANT HE WAS ALLOWED TO RUN
SO FLEABAG STARTED RUNNING AFTER SNOT
SNOT WAS LAUGHING BECAUSE HE KNEW FLEABAG COULD
NEVER CATCH HIM BUT SUDDENLY HE NOTICED THAT FLEABAG WAS CATCHING UP TO HIM AND BEFORE HE KNEW IT
FLEABAG RAN
INTO HIM AND KNOCKED HIM DOWN AND SAID BARK BARK BARK WHICH IN DOG
TALK MEANS DON'T YOU EVER MESS WITH ME AGAIN SNOT

ROOSTER JOHN BEFORE I TELL YOU ABOUT ROOSTER JOHN
GOT HIS NAME I SHOULD TELL
YOU SHOULD KNOW A LITTLE ABOUT
FRANKSVILLE WAS A TOWN THAT SEEMED TO HAVE ONE PROBLEM AFTER THE OTHER
THEIR PROBLEMS STARTED OUT WHEN THEY RAN OUT OF WATER
THANKFULLY SOMEONE WAS DIGGING A HOLE AND FOUND WATER
SOON AFTER THAT STARTED TO GET THE FLIES THEY GOT TONS AND TONS OF FLIES
THEN THE FLIES STOPPED
BUT JUST THEN A MAN MOVED INTO TOWN WHO PLAYED THE FLUTE SO BADLY THAT PEOPLE WOULD RUN STOPPED RUN AWAY SCREAMING THIS MAYBE
A POORLY
PLAYED FLUTE DOESN'T SOUND ALL THAT BAD BUT JUST TRY TO IMAGINE SOMEONE SCRATCHING A CHALKBOARD WITH A FORK
FLUTE SOUNDED WHEN THIS GUY PLAYED IT I'M SERIOUS STILL IT'S NOT AS BAD AS MILLIONS OF FLIES I SUPPOSE
<unk> THE BAD FLUTE
PLAYER WAS ROOSTER JOHN HE WASN'T CALLED ROOSTER JOHN YET
THAT CAME LATER
HE WAS THE
WAS THE NEW TOWN DENTIST
HE WAS AN EXCELLENT DENTIST BUT HIS REAL LOVE WAS MUSIC
HE PLAYED MANY MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS SUCH AS GUITAR THE TUBA THE PIANO AND THE CLARINET
HOWEVER FOR SOME REASON
THE WAY HIS MOUTH WAS
WAS SHAPED MADE HIS FLUTE SOUND AWFUL WE CAN'T HE WE CAN'T LET YOU PLAY THE FLUTE ANYMORE JOHN
SAID THE POLICE CHIEF S SAID POLICE CHIEF SANDERS THE NEIGHBORS ARE COMPLAINING AND THE CATS AND DOGS ARE TRYING TO CHEW OFF THEIR EARS
BUT I HAVE TO PLAY I WAS BORN TO DO IT I DON'T KNOW WHY BUT I FEEL LIKE
I HAVE TO
T
TO OR EL OR ELSE BAD THINGS WILL HAPPEN LOOK JOHN I'VE
HEARD YOU PLAY THE CLARINET YOU'RE QUITE GOOD WHY DON'T YOU PLAY THAT INSTEAD
SAID CHIEF SANDERS
OH
OH THAT'S A NICE INSTRUMENT BUT
IT'S JUST NOT THE FLUTE I EVEN WROTE YOU A SONG CHIEF SANDERS IT'S CALLED COPS AND ROBBERS THEN HE PLAYED THE SONG
THE POLICE CHIEF HATED THE SO
SOUND SO MUCH THAT HE THREW JOHN IN JAIL
THEY COULDN'T KEEP JOHN IN JAIL SINCE WAS WERE BREAKING ANY LAWS
SO OF
SO THERE WAS NOTH SO THERE WAS NOTHING
THE POLICE COULD DO BESIDES EVERYBODY LOVED JOHN SINCE HE HAD BECOME
THE TOWN DENTIST EVERYBODY'S TEETH WERE MUCH WHITER AND CLEANER AND NO ONE HAD ANY CAVITIES SO THE THERE W WAS A PROBLEM IN
IN THE LITTLE TOWN OF OF FRANKVILLE OF OF FRANKSVILLE
WHAT
WHAT SHOULD THEY DO THE
THEY COULDN'T KEEP JOHN IN JAIL AND THEY
DIDN'T WANT TO KICK OUT OF OUT OF TOWN
BECAUSE THEY ALL HAD SUCH
NICE TEETH SO THEY SO THEY
DECIDED THAT JOHN COULD PLAY THE FLUTE AND EVERYBODY ELSE WOULD HAVE TO WEAR EARPLUGS WELL I'M SURE YOU GUESSED THAT
THAT DIDN'T WORK
NO ONE COULD HEAR ANYTHING PEOPLE WERE GETTING INTO CAR ACCIDENTS AND EVERYBODY
LOOKED REALLY SILLY AT THE DANCES DANCING TO MUSIC THEY COULDN'T HEAR THEY JUST COULDN'T LEAD A NORMAL LIFE
SO THEY DECIDED TO LOWER HIM DOWN A WELL
AND LET HIM PLAY DOWN WHERE NO ONE COULD HEAR HIM
JOHN THOUGHT THAT WAS AN OK IDEA BUT
BUT AN ECHO IN THE WELL THE FLUTE SOUND LOUDER
WINDOWS WERE BREAKING
AND ALL THE COWS IN TOWN STARTED TO MAKE SOUR MILK
THE LOCAL DENTIST DR
WONG CAME UP WITH AN IDEA
HE THOUGHT IF THAT HE MADE A NEW MOUTHPIECE
ES ESPECIALLY SHAPED FOR JOHN'S MOUTH <unk>
PLAY THE FLUTE NORMALLY
AND GUESS WHAT IT WORKED
DR WONG WAS THE TOWN HERO THE FLUTE SOUNDED NORMAL AND IT TURNED
OUT JOHN COULD PLAY IT QUITE WELL
THE
THE PEOPLE IN
TOWN DECIDED TO HAVE A GREAT BIG PARADE IN FRANKSVILLE
TO CELEBRATE THE FACT FOR ONCE THERE THERE WAS NO WATER PROBLEM NO FLY PROBLEM AND NO FLUTE PROBLEM
DR WONG AND JOHN WERE THE STARS OF THE PARADE
THEY WERE THE WERE UP ON THE MAIN FLOAT A BIG BAND PLAYED AS THEY MARCHED UP AND DOWN MAIN STREET
EVERYONE CHEERED
THEN SUDDENLY
A FLY LANDED ON A LITTLE GIRL THEN A FLY LANDED ON SOMEONE ELSE THEN SOME LANDED ON A BUNCH OF PEOPLE PRETTY SOON TONS OF FLIES TONS OF FLIES
WERE LANDING ON EVERYONE
BEFORE THEY KNEW IT THE TOWN WAS FILLED WITH FLIES
OH NO CRY CRY CHIEF SANDERS JUST WHEN THINGS WERE WERE GOING GOOD FOR
FRANKSVILLE
JOHN NO
WHAT TO DO SO HE JUST KEPT ON PIECES
FLUTE THE FLIES WERE ANNOYING FLIES WOULD SWAT HIS FLUTE
UP
AT THEM WITH HIS HAND OR EVEN HIS NEW FLUTE
HE STARTED SHAKING THE FLUTE TO GET THE FLIES OFF AND ACCIDENTALLY SMASHED PIECES
BUT IT WAS VERY UPSET AT FIRST THEN HE SAID OH WELL GOOD THING I BROUGHT MY OLD FLUTE AS BACK UP
NO NO PLEASE DON'T PLAY YOUR OLD FLUTE BEGGED DR
WONG BUT IT WAS TOO LATE JOHN HAD STARTED PLAYING SWAT AT THE TOWNSFOLK
THEN HE SAID
WHEN THE TOWNSFOLK HEARD THE NOISE THEY COULDN'T EVEN SWAT
FLIES ANYMORE THEY HAD TO COVER THEIR EARS FROM THE HORRIBLE SOUND
THE FLIES WOULD LAND ALL OVER
THE PEOPLE AS
IT INTO
THEY COULDN'T SWAT THEM OFF IT WAS GROSS THEN SUDDENLY THE FLIES
FLEW AWAY FAST AS THEY COULD
DR WONG THOUGHT FOR A SECOND THEN PRONOUNCED
IT'S THE FLUTE SOUND THE FLIES HATE JOHN'S FLUTE PLAYING AS MUCH AS WE DO
JOHN THE DENTIST IS DRIVING THE FLIES AWAY
AND IT WAS THEN THAT THE PEOPLE OF FRANKSVILLE REAL REALIZED THAT THEY WOULD HAVE TO
IT TO TAKE
THE GOOD WITH THE BAD BECAUSE AS BAD AS THE FLUTE SOUNDED IT WAS A LOT BAD BETTER
THAN THOUSANDS OF FLIES CRAWLING ON THEM
FROM THEN ON JOHN WOULD WAKE UP AT SUNRISE
LIKE A ROOSTER AND PLAY TO KEEP THE FLIES AWAY
IT WAS WELL SORT OF WELL IT WAS TOWN CALLED FRANKSVILLE
WELL IN THIS TOWN CALLED FRANKSVILLE THERE WERE A LOT OF PROBLEMS HAPPENING AND ONE OF THE ONES WAS FLIES AND ANOTHER WAS WAS A BAD FLUTE PLAYING
SIL
FOR SOMETIME ON THERE THERE WERE S AFTER THE FLIES HAD GONE AWAY THERE WERE S SOME SOLUTIONS THAT DIDN'T QUITE WORK ABOUT ABOUT THE FLUTE PLAYING EVEN THOUGH THEY TOLD HIM TO STOP PLAYING THE FLUTE HE WOULDN'T
AND EVENTUALLY A T A PERSON A DENTIST NAMED DOCTOR WONG FOUND OUT A WAY A WAY TO M MAKE THE FLUTE S S SOUND
SIL
NICE
<br>
A SPECIAL LIKE CAST THAT WENT OVER THE FLUTE PLAYERS MOUTH AND MADE THE FLUTE SOUND BETTER
SIL
AND IT WORKED
THERE WAS A BIG PARADE AND IT AND IT STARTED OUT PRETTY GOOD BUT THEN SOME FLIES STARTED LANDING ON PEOPLE AND THEN TONS AND TONS OF FLIES STARTED STARTED TO COME
SIL
AND THEN WHEN AFTER AFTER A LITTLE WHILE THE THE NEW FLUTE JOHN HAD GOT BROKE SO HE HAD TO USE HIS OLD ONE AND IT SOUNDED BAD EVEN WITH THE CAST
SIL
SO
SIL
WHAT HAPPENED IS IS THAT ALL THE TOWNSFOLK DIDN'T LIKE IT AND
<br>
LIKE THE FLUTE PLAYING OR THE FLIES BUT THEN THE FLIES STARTED GOING AWAY IT WAS IT WAS ALMOST IT THE THE TOWNSPEOPLE FOUND OUT THAT THE FLIES HATED IT AS MUCH AS THEY DID
IT WAS IT WAS MORE OVERLY A HALF MIRACLE

WELL THE DOG HAD A PIECE OF MEAT AND ON THE WAY HOME HE SAW ANOTHER DOG IN THE RIVER WITH A BIGGER PIECE OF MEAT WHICH WAS REALLY HIM AND UHM THE DOG WANTED THE PIECE OF MEAT SO HE HE
SIL
HE DID STUFF TO THAT HE THINK WOULD SCARE THE DOG AND WHEN HE BARKED THE PIECE OF MEAT FELL OUT OF HIS MOUTH AND SANK TO THE BOTTOM OF THE RIVER
RAMONA AND RITA SAT ON THE BACK PORCH OF THEIR NEW HOME THEY HAD MOVED THE COUNTRY JUST THEY MOVED TO THE COUNTRY JUST TWO WEEKS AGO RAMONA STILL MISSED THE CITY
HE MISSED THEIR OLD SCHOOL HE MISSED PLAYING WITH HIS FRIENDS ON THEIR STREET RITA FINISHED
TYING STRING ONTO A KITE
WHAT A GREAT DAY FOR FLYING A KITE SHE SMILED AT HER BROTHER JUST LISTEN TO THE WIND IN THE TREES I HATE THE COUNTRY RAMONA SAID IT'S TOO QUIET HERE
IT'S NOT SO QUIET SAID RITA THERE ARE LOTS OF SOUNDS THEY'RE JUST NOT THE SAME KINDS OF SOUNDS THAT YOU HEAR IN NEW YORK
JUST LISTEN RAMONA
NO
RAMON
RAMON LISTENED HE HEARD A BIRD SINGING
HE HEARD COWBELLS RINGING FROM THE FARM DOWN THE ROAD HE HEARD THE SOFT SOUND OF WIND BLOWING THROUGH THE TREES
WHEN THEY HEARD SOMETHING
STRANGE WHAT WAS THAT ASKED RITA I DON'T KNOW RAMON RA
RAMON LOOKED AROUND THE PORCH HE SAW NOTHING BUT SOME EMPTY BOTTLES I THINK THE HOUSE IS GROANING WHISPERED RITA
MAYBE IT'S THE WIND SAID RAMON
THE SOUND STOPS WHEN THE WIND STOPS IT STARTS WHEN THE WIND BLOWS IT'S THE HOUSE THAT'S MAKING THE NOISE I DON'T LIKE IT RAMON SAID RITA
THE WIND
BLEW
THEY HEARD THE SOUND AGAIN THIS TIME RAMON KNEW IT WHAT IT WAS
RAMON WALKED OVER TO THE EMPTY
WALKED OVER TO THE EMPTY BOTTLES ON THE PORCH RITA FOLLOWED HE PICKED UP A BOTTLE AND BLEW ACROSS THE TOP OF IT
THERE IT WAS THAT STRANGE SOUND
SO THAT'S WHAT'S BEEN MAKING THOSE ODD NOISES SAID A VOICE BEHIND THEM THEIR MOTHER WAS STANDING AT THE DOOR
WHY DOES THE BOTTLE MAKE THAT SOUND MOM ASKED RITA
SHE FELT SILLY FOR THINKING
THAT THE HOUSE HAD GROANED COME INSIDE SAID THEIR MOTHER WE CAN TALK WHILE I WORK
RAMON SAID RITA P
RAMON AND RITA PICKED UP THE BOTTLES AND FOLLOWED THEIR MOTHER INTO THE HOUSE
SEVERAL BOXES SAT AT THE KITCHEN FLOOR MOM WAS TAKING DISHES OUT OF ONE BOX AND PUTTING THEM AWAY WHEN YOU BLOW ACROSS THE TOP OF A BOTTLE MOM EXPLAINED THE AIR INSIDE THE BOTTLE VIBRATES
WHAT DOES VIBRATE MEAN ASKED RAMON
WELL THE AIR INSIDE THE BOTTLE MOVES BACK AND FORTH VERY QUICKLY MOM ANSWERED THESE MOVEMENTS ARE CALLED VIBRATIONS
DAD CAME INTO THE ROOM
LOOK KIDS HE SAID I CAN SHOW YOU WHAT VIBRATIONS ARE HE HELD A RUBBER BAND IN HIS HAND DAD PULLED THE RUBBER BAND TIGHT BETWEEN TWO FINGERS PULL THE RUBBER BAND RITA HE SAID AND THEN LET IT GO
RAMON WATCHED RITA PULL THE RUBBER BAND AND LET GO IT MOVED QUICKLY IT MADE A FUNNY SOUND DID YOU SEE THE RUBBER BAND VIBRATE ASKED DAD IT MOVED BACK AND FORTH VERY FAST AND MADE IT THE AIR AROUND IT MOVE VERY FAST THE AIR MOVING BACK AND FORTH THOSE MOVEMENTS ARE VIBRATIONS RIGHT ASKED RAMON
AND VIBRATIONS MAKE THE SOUNDS RIGHT ASKED
RIGHT ASKED RITA MOM SMILED YOU'RE BOTH RIGHT SHE SAID THOSE VIBRATIONS MOVE THROUGH THE AIR INTO OUR EARS MOM EXPLAINED
OUR EARS SEND A MESSAGE TO OUR BRAIN
AND THAT'S HOW WE HEAR SOUNDS RITA PICKED UP A BOTTLE IT WAS SHORTER THAN THE OTHERS SHE BLEW IT ACROSS THE TOP OF IT THAT BOTTLE SOUNDS LIKE A WHISTLE SAID RAMON THAT'S RIGHT SAID DAD A TALL BOTTLE MAKES A DEEP SOUND
THERE IS MORE ROOM INSIDE IT THE AIR TO VIBRATE A SHORTER BOTTLE MAKES A HIGHER SOUND
IT HAS LESS ROOM INSIDE FOR THE AIR TO VIBRATE
DAD SAID RAMON WE HAVE MANY SIZES OF BOTTLES
WILL THEY ALL MAKE DIFFERENT SOUNDS
LET'S TRY THEM SAID DAD EACH BOTTLE MADE A DIFFERENT SOUND
I
TOLD YOU THERE WERE LOTS OF THINGS TO HEAR
AROUND HERE JOKED RITA
THEN A NEW SOUND FILLED THE ROOM
IT'S THUNDER SAID MOM THERE MUST BE A STORM
WE'D BETTER SHUT THE WINDOWS RAMON AND RITA RACED TO CLOSE THE WINDOWS DAD CLOSED THE DOOR THEY FINISHED JUST IN TIME THE WIND STARTED BLOWING HARDER SUDDENLY THE HOUSE REALLY DID BEGIN TO GROAN
EVERYONE LOOKED AROUND WHERE IS THAT AWFUL NOISE COMING FROM ASKED MOM I NEVER HEARD A SOUND LIKE THAT IN NEW YORK RITA WHISPERED RAMON WAS STANDING NEAR THE FIREPLACE
WHEN THEY HEARD THE GROAN AGAIN I THINK IT'S COMING FROM THE FIREPLACE HE SAID THE FIREPLACE IS MAKING THAT SPOOKY SOUND THE WIND SLOWED DOWN FOR A MOMENT THEN HOUSE BECAME QUIET AGAIN
RITA BEGAN TO LAUGH IT'S NOT SPOOKY SHE SAID IT'S JUST
THE CHIMNEY THE CHIMNEY IS LIKE A GIANT BOTTLE WHEN THE WIND BLOWS OVER IT THE AIR INSIDE VIBRATES AND BECAUSE IT'S SO TALL IT MAKES A REALLY DEEP SOUND RAMON ADDED I THINK RAMON AND RITA ARE RIGHT LAUGHED MOM
AS IF TO PROVE THAT THEY HAD SEEN THE WIND BLEW AGAIN THE HOUSE GROANED

TO GO SEE HARRY POTTER IT WAS NICE
WHY DID A PANDA WITH THE BEAUTIFUL GIRL NAME YIN YIN HAVE HER NAME CHANGED TO
NAME COLUMBUS IT WAS FRED'S IDEA SO LET'S BEGIN WITH FRED
FRED FRED
FRED FED THE PANDA BEARS AND TIGERS AND TURTLES THE TURTLES WEREN'T SO BAD BUT AS FOR THE TIGERS HE WASN'T SO SURE
HE DIDN'T MIND HANDLING WITH THE RAW MEAT HE HAD TO FEED THE TI TO THE TIGERS HIS MAIN OBJECTION WAS TO BEING EATEN NO ONE COULD BLAME FRED REALLY SINCE NO ONE REALLY WANTS TO BE EATEN SOME
PEOPLE
DO LIKE TO BITE THEIR FINGER NAILS BUT FRED WASN'T A NAIL BITER SO BEING EATEN WAS DEFINITELY NOT SOMETHING HE LOOKED FORWARD TO EACH AFTERNOON AT THREE O'CLOCK WHEN IT WAS TIME TO FEED THE TIGERS
FOR FRED WHEN IT CAME TO THE PANDA'S HE HAD A WARM SPOT IN HIS HEART
ACTUALLY IT WAS A EIGHTY FIVE DEGREES
UH ACTUALLY IT WAS A EIGHTY FIVE
N
FIVE DEGREES ON HIS LEFT KIDNEY BUT THE POINT IS THAT HE WAS VERY FOND OF FEEDING THE PANDA'S
THERE WERE THREE PANDA'S
AND THEY WERE KNOWN AS THE PAN FAMILY
THEY
WERE
IN ORDER OF CUTENESS YIN YIN THE YOUNG DAUGHTER POO POO THE MOTHER AND MOO MAN THE GENTLE AND ALWAYS SLEEPY FATHER
MANY PEOPLE KNOW THAT PANDAS EAT BAMBOO A LOT OF IT
A LOT OF BAMBOO CAN GET QUITE HEAVY SO BECAUSE OF THE PANDAS FRED BECAME VERY STRONG
WAS IN TERRIFIC SHAPE
BUT PHYSICAL FITNESS WAS NOT
ONLY
REASON THAT FRED LOVED THE PANDAS
THE OTHER REASON WAS THAT
ANYONE
WHO GETS WITHIN THREE FEET OF A PANDA AUTOMATICALLY FALLS IN LOVE WITH THEM
IT'S A LAW OF NATURE
AT FURTHER DISTANCE PANDAS HAVE A STRANGE ALMOST MAGICAL EFFECT ON HUMAN
BEINGS WHICH MAKES US WANT TO HUG AND SQUEEZE THINGS
FRED WAS NOT ALLOWED TO ACTUALLY HUG THE PANDA BEARS SINCE THAT
COULD BE DANGEROUS
SO
ALL THE OTHER PEOPLE AT THE ZOO WOULD
KNOW THAT THE PANDAS
HAD JUST BEEN HAD JUST BEEN FED WHEN THEY SAW FRED HUGGING
THE
RATHER UN CUDDLY PALM TREE OUTSIDE OF
THE PANDA'S ROOM
IT IS INTERESTING TO POINT OUT AT THIS
TIME THAT MORE STUFFED PANDA BEARS
ARE SO OLD AT ZOO GIFT SHOP
THEN ALL
OF THE OTHER STUFF ANIMALS COMBINED
THIS
THIS CAN CERTAINLY BE ACCOUNTED FOR
BY THIS STRANGE ALMOST MAGICAL EFFECT THAT THE PANDA POSSESS
BUT EVERYTHING WAS NOT ALL BAMBOO
AND HUGS AT THE ZOO
ONE MORNING FRED WAS FEEDING YIN YIN AND SAID
OH YIN YIN
I WISH THAT MORE PEOPLE WOULD COME TO VISIT THE ZOO
I KNOW I SHOULDN'T BE TELLING YOU THIS
BUT WE M
MIGHT HAVE TO SELL YOU AND YOUR FAMILY TO THE BIG ZOO
IN SA IN ANGELES
IF WE DON'T GET MORE MONEY
THAT
IT'S NOT THAT YOU'RE
YOU AREN'T SELLING ENOUGH STUFFED PANDA BEARS
IT'S JUST THAT WE'RE
IT'S JUST THAT THERE HASN'T BEEN ENOUGH
COMING
TO SEE THE FIRST PLACE I THINK
WHAT THE ZOO NEEDS IS A GREAT EVERYTHING
COMPANION
FRED WAS STARTING TO FEEL
THE UNCONTROLLABLE
URGE
TO HUG THE PANDA
SO
BEFORE HE RAN OFF TO HUG THE PALM
TREE
QUICKLY HE SAID IT COSTS SO MUCH TO
FEED YOU PANDA BEARS
I WOULD HATE
IF YOU HAD TO LEAVE US
AFTER ALL
IT'S ONLY HOME YOU KNOW BESIDES
IF YOU
LEAVE
I'LL GET TERRIBLY OUT OF SHAPE
NOW IF YOU EXCUSE ME I NEED
TO SQUEEZE SOMETHING BEFORE I SCREAM
BUT YIN YIN PANDA WAS NOT LISTENING TO FRED
SHE WAS TALKING TO HER BEST FRIEND
MAGGIE THE MAGPIE ABOUT GOING
TO THE MOON
YES THE BIG ONE IN THE SKY THAT IS MOSTLY
NOT MOSTLY LIKELY NOT MADE OF CHEESE
AND MOST CERTAINLY NOT MADE OF BAMBOO
YIN YIN AND HER BEST FRIEND MAGGIE
MAGPIE WHO LOOKED A LOT LIKE A PANDA IF
A LOT LIKE A PANDA WOULD LOOK IF
PANDAS WERE BIRDS
WERE DISCUSSING
WERE DISCUSSING ABOUT GOING TO THE MOON
HER MOTHER AND FATHER KNEW I
KNEW WHAT THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT SINCE THEY HADN'T
HADN'T TALKED
FOR
THOUGH
THEY HADN'T THOUGHT OR TALKED OF MUCH ELSE SINCE
YIN YIN SAID I WANT TO GO THERE AND POINTED TO THE MOON
THAT'S
ANOTHER THAT'S ENOUGH OF THIS
THAT'S ENOUGH OF THIS NONSENSE SAID YIN YIN'S MOTHER POO POO
WHAT SORT OF NONSENSE IS THIS FOR YOUNG PANDA BEAR GOING TO THE MOON INDEED
NONSENSE YOUR JOB IS TO BE CUTE SO PEOPLE WANT TO
RUN TO THE GIFT SHOP
AND BUY PANDA BEAR DOLLS
IT'S SIMPLE ECONOMICS LIKE IT OR NOT
WE ARE
SPOKE
SPOKESPEOPLE
FOR THE PANDA STUFFED
ANIMAL INDUSTRY
WHICH YOUNG LADY HELPS FOR PAY FOR THE BAMBOO
THAT YOU EAT SUCH SUCH NONSENSE
GOING TO THE MOON SAID HER MOTHER POO POO
BUT I JUST LEARNED
HOW TO
BUT I JUST LEARNED HOW TO MAKE HOW TO MAKE MYSELF INTO A BALL AND ROLL IN TWO DAYS
ROLL TWO DAYS
AGO AND I'M BECOMING VERY GOOD AT IT
I DON'T THINK
IT'LL IT'LL TAKE
I DON'T THINK IT WILL TAKE THAT LONG TO ROLL THERE SAID YIN YIN
YIN YIN'S FATHER MOO MAN
DIDN'T
DIDN'T THINK
IT WAS VERY PROPER FOR A WISE YOUNG PANDA BEAR TO GO ROLLING OFF TO PLACES
BUT WHERE THERE WASN'T ANY BAMBOO BUT HE WAS SUPPORTIVE OF HIS YOUNG DAUGHTER
AND SHOWED HIS SUPPORT BY TAKING A NAP
BUT BEFORE HE FELL
TO SLEEP HE DID
DID MANAGE TO SAY
I BELIEVE ROLLING IS A DECIDEDLY ROUND ABOUT WAY TO GO
IF YOU
MUST GO IT WILL BE BEST TO FLY
NONSENSE SAID THE MOTHER
I'M SO MAD I'M GOING TO LOOK AT THAT LADY OVER THERE AND MAKE HER WANT TO SQUEEZE
HER SON
I'M SO MAD I'M GOING TO LOOK AT THAT LADY OVER THERE MAKE HER WANT TO SQUEEZE HER SON CHEEKS
SHE SAID SPITEFULLY
AN INSTANT
LATER A YOUNG BOY WAS
HEARD SAYING
OUCH MOM CUT THAT OUT
I'M SORRY TO SAY BUT
BUT MANY A LITTLE BOY'S CHEEKS HAVE BEEN
MADE
I'M SORRY TO SAY BUT
MANY A LITTLE BOY'S CHEEKS
HAVE BEEN
MADE RAW
MADE RAW WHEN MOTHER POO POO PANDA WAS UPSET
YIN YIN WAS ALWAYS ONE TO TAKE GOOD ADVICE FROM HER FATHER
AND LESS THAN A WEEK LATER YIN YIN AND MAGGIE HAD BUILT A ROCKET SHIP OUT OF BAMBOO
BAMBOO IS A VERY WORKABLE SUBSTANCE AND PANDAS
TEND TO HANDLE BAMBOO A LOT SO THIS ITSELF
WAS NOT THAT
ASTONISHING AT LEAST
TO YIN YINS PARENTS FRED SURE WAS IMPRESSED THOUGH
I KNOW
THE MAIN OBSTACLE
IT TURNS OUT
WAS
THE MAIN OBSTACLE IT'S TURNS OUT
IT THE MAIN OBSTACLE IT TURNS OUT WAS
GETTING THE ROCKET SHIP OFF THE GROUND
MAGGIE
FIGURED THAT IF
HER AND THREE OF HER STRONGEST MAGPIE FRIENDS
WERE TO EACH GRAB HOLD OF A CORNER
OF
THE
ROCKET SHIP
THEY COULD ALL FLY TO THE MOON SO THEY TRIED
ONE TWO THREE TO THE MOON
THEY SAID TOGETHER PULLING WITH ALL THEIR MIGHT
I SEE YOUR WING FLAPPING BUT WE DON'T SEEM TO BE GOING ANYWHERE SAID YIN YIN
HMM
HEAVIER
THAN I THOUGHT I THINK WE WILL NEED MORE MAGPIES SAID MAGGIE
YES BUT HOW MANY MORE
YIN YIN SAID I'M NOT SURE EXACTLY REPLIED MAGGIE
THE FATHER WATCHING THIS ALL THROUGH ONE EYE
FOR HE ALWAYS
HAD AT LEAST ONE
EYE ASLEEP AT ALL
TIMES SAID
UH
SAID
T'WOULDN'T
WO
T'WOULD WOULD BE BEST
TO ASK THE OWL THEN CLOSED HIS EYE
SO MAGGIE FLEW TO THE OWL AND
ASKED FOR HIS ADVICE OH WISE OWL
I HAVE A QUESTION THAT I FEAR
ONLY YOU CAN ANSWER SHE SAID
HOW TO TURN YOUR HEAD ALL THE WAY AROUND WITHOUT GETTING A TERRIBLE PAIN IN YOUR NECK
SAID OWL
NO HOW MANY MAGPIE
WOULD BE NEEDED TO FLY
A FOUR HUNDRED POUND PANDA BEAR
AND A ONE HUNDRED
POUND BAMBOO ROCKET SHIP
TO
TO THE MOON SAID MAGGIE
THE OWL INSTANTLY
REPLIED TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND AND SEVENTY SIX
OR TAKE TWO
GIVE OR TAKE TWO
A WEEK LATER MAGGIE MANAGED TO ROUND UP TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND AND SEVENTY EIGHT MAGPIE
SHE COULD BE
A VERY PERCEIVED LITTLE BIRD
WHEN SHE WANTED
A WEEK LATER DESPITE MUCH FLAPPING THEY WERE STILL TRYING
TO GET
THE ROCKET IN THE AIR IT TURNS OUT
THAT THE OWL DIDN'T TAKE CONSIDERATION
THAT ONCE YOU EVER GET A THOUSAND MAGPIE
TOGETHER THEY TEND TO FIGHT
AND CAN'T AGREE ON A SINGLE THING
NOW WHILE THIS WAS GOING ON DO YOU SUPPOSE
DO YOU SUPPOSED WHAT FRED WAS DOING
LIKE HE WAS FEEDING THE PANDAS LIKE HE WAS SUPPOSED TO SO ONE DAY
AFTER FRED HAD FED THE PANDAS AND WAS HUGGING
THE PALM TREE
THE ZOO
MANAGER CAME UP TO HIM AND SAID
FRED
WHAT IS GOING ON WITH YOUR PANDAS FRED
I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT
IT'S TAKEN ME A COUPLE WEEKS TO FIGURE OUT IT OUT BUT
I THINK YIN YIN WANTS TO GO TO THE MOON AND MAGPIES WANT TO TAKE HER THERE
SAID FRED
OH WELL THAT MAKES SENSE THEN SAID THE MANAGER
DID YOU KNOW THAT SINCE THE LITTLE PANDA BUILT
THAT BAMBOO ROCKET SHIP
AND THOSE MAGPIES SAID STARTED FLUTTERING ABOUT
THAT
THAT
ZOO'S PROFITS
HAVE GONE UP FOUR THOUSAND PERCENT
THIS IS
JUST THE TYPE OF EXPOSURE
WE NEEDED
THOSE PANDA'S
WILL BE WITH
US FOR A LONG TIME
FRED
THOUGHT ABOUT IT AND SAID YOU KNOW
I THINK WE SHOULD RENAME YIN YIN COLUMBUS
THE K THE ZOO KEEPER SAID GOOD HEAVENS MAN THAT IS A GREAT IDEA
NO WAIT
NO WAIT A SECOND
I DON'T UNDERSTAND
WELL SIR
WELL SIR
WHEN COLUMBUS SET OUT
ON HIS SHIP HE WAS REALLY TRYING TO FIND A QUICKER WAY TO GET AROUND
EUROPE IN ORDER TO IM
TRADE
HE
WANTED A BUSI TO BE
A BUSINESS MAN BUT
INSTEAD BECAME A GREAT EXPLORER
YES BUT WHAT DOES THAT HAVE TO DO
WITH THE PANDAS MAN SAID THE ZOO KEEPER MANAGER
WELL IT SEEMS TO ME SIR THAT YIN YIN WANTED BE GREAT EXPLORER
AND INSTEAD
AND INSTEAD BECOME A BUSINESS WOMAN
I SEE FRED
ONE MORE THING SIR ABOUT THOSE MAGPIES FLYING ABOVE THE PANDAS
DO YOU THINK THAT ZOO COULD PURCHASE ME A LARGE
SIZED UMBRELLA
THE ZOO MANAGER
THE ZOO MANAGER
LAUGHED AND WALKED AWAY BUT DID PURCHASE A FASHIONABLE YELLOW UMBRELLA
FOR FRED THE NEXT DAY
BACK IN THE IN THE PANDA'S HOME THE MOTHER PANDA POO POO
WAS VERY PROUD OF HER DAUGHTER
AFTER ALL
IF IT WEREN'T FOR YIN YIN
THEY WOULD THEY WOULD HAVE
HAD TO MOVE FROM THEIR WONDERFUL HOME
BUT LATER WHEN FRED WALKED INTO THE PANDA'S HOME UNDER A HIS
NEW YELLOW UMBRELLA ALL SHE COULD
THINK TO SAY WAS NONSENSE
AS FOR YIN YIN SHE WAS VERY
SHE WAS VERY PROUD TO
BE
RENAMED AFTER A FAMOUS EXPLORER
AND SHE AND
MAGGIE NEVER STOPPED TRYING TO GET TO THE MOON
NO
SIL
UHM YIN YIN AND MAGGIE ARE TRYING TO GET TO THE MOON
UH WELL THEY BUILT A ROCKETSHIP OUT OF BAMBOO AND THEY GOT LIKE A LOT OF MAGPIES TO UHM LIFT THE ROCKETSHIP UP TO SPACE AND THEY NEVER STOPPED TRYING
SIL
TO GET TO THE MOON
UHM
SIL
WELL HE HE UHM
SIL
UHM I CAN'T REALLY REMEMBER ABOUT THAT
SIL
I REMEMBER THAT UHM
SIL
THAT FRED WAS KIND OF WAS KIND OF THINKING ABOUT NAMING YIN YIN COLUMBUS
SIL
UHM BECAUSE HE THOUGHT THAT YIN YIN WANTED TO BE A GOOD EXPLORER AND COLMBUS WAS AN EXPLORER SO WAS THINKING ABOUT RENAMED HER COLUMBUS
OK SO RIGHT
LIKE

EVERY OTHER
DAY JULIO WORKED ON HIS SPEED HE W WOULD CHOOSE A TREE NOT TOO FAR AWAY AND RACE TO IT HE WOULD
REST
BY COUNTING TO SIXTY
THEN HE WOULD RUN BACK TO WHERE HE STARTED THEN HE'D DO IT OVER AGAIN EACH TIME HE PRACTICED SPRINTING HE THOUGHT OF WHAT
HE IT WOULD BE LIKE WHEN HE

FILLING
WITH
A

EXPLAINED MR CHU
FISH NEED TO BREATH AIR JUST LIKE PEOPLE DO
TO KEEP OUR FISH HEALTHY WE CAN CLEAN
WE
CAN
WAIT WE CLEAN THEIR AIR
AND WATER
WE USE A AIR PUMP TO
PUT
FRESH AIR
INTO THEIR TANKS
THE AIR PUMP MAKES THE BUBBLES
HOW DOES THE WATER GET CLEAN ASKED TOM
THE AIR PUMP
PUSHES
THE WATER THROUGH
A FILTER

TOM LOOKED AT
HIS FISH
BUT HE COULDN'T STOP THINKING ABOUT THE BUBBLES
MR CHU
WHY ARE
SOME
BUBBLES BIG
WHY
ARE SOME SMALL
SOME BUBBLES HAVE MORE AIR IN THEM THAN OTHER BUBBLES
A BUBBLE HOLDS
AIR JUST LIKE A BALLOON SAID MR CHU
THE MORE AIR YOU BLOW IN THE BALLOON
THE BIGGER IT GETS
TOM LOOKED AT THE BUBBLES IN THE FISH TANKS
MY FISHBOWL DOESN'T HAVE
AN AIR PUMP HE SAID
THERE ARE NO BUBBLES
OF AIR IN THE WATER
IS
THAT WHY MY

EVERY FOUR YEARS TURTLES FROM ALL OVER THE LAND WOULD CRAWL TO GREAT POND
IT WOULD TAKE SOME TURTLES
THERE WAS LOTS OF EATING AND L
EVERY FOUR YEARS TURTLES FROM ALL OVER THE LAND WOULD CRAWL TO THE GREAT POND
IT WOULD TAKE SOME TURTLES FROM FAR AWAY VILLAGES TWO WHOLE WEEKS JUST TO GET THERE
DROUGHT DWELLERS
FESTIVAL
WHERE THERE WAS LOTS OF EATING AND LAUGHING
TURTLES COULD CATCH UP WITH FRIENDS THEY HAD NOT SEEN SINCE THE LAST FESTIVAL
EVERYTHING ABOUT THE FESTIVAL WAS FUN
BUT THE MAIN THAT EVENT WAS THE GREAT TURTLE RACE THE WINNER OF THE GREAT TURTLE RACE WAS SO IMPORTANT THAT HE OR OR SHE DIDN'T HAVE TO MOVE FOR FOUR YEARS UNTIL THE NEXT FESTIVAL
THE LESS A TURTLE MOVES THE BIGGER THEY GET AND
THE LONGER THEY LIVE
SO YOU CAN SEE WINNING THE GREAT
RACE IS A GOOD HONOR
THE TURTLE CUP WAS THE TROPHY THAT THE WINNER WOULD TAKE HOME IN THEIR VILLAGE
THERE WAS THE MOST FAMOUS TURTLE
THERE WAS
HE WAS THE SLOWEST TURTLE OF ALL TIME
HE HADN'T HAD TO MOVE FOR OVER FIFTY YEARS HE WAS THE BIGGEST MOST RESPECTED AND ALSO ONE OF THE TRICKIEST TURTLES THERE WAS THERE WAS
THERE WAS WERE MANY
LEGENDS ABOUT HIM
IT WAS R MORNING HE WAS SO SLOW
HIS HEART WOULD ONLY BEAT BEAT ONCE A DAY
HIS NAME WAS MUD
AND HE WAS THE GREATEST
CHAMPION IN THE HISTORY OF SHELL DWELLER'S FESTIVAL
HE WAS UNBEATABLE
WHEN MUD
WAS IN HIS PRIME THERE WAS A NEW TURTLE BORN IN BLUE POND FOR THE TURTLE WAS NAMED SWISH WHEN SWISH WAS BORN
EVERYONE THOUGHT HE WAS A LITTLE SLOW BUT AS HE GOT A LITTLE OLDER THE TURTLES BEGAN TO REALIZE THAT SWISH WAS REALLY REALLY REALLY SLOW
ONCE HIS MOTHER CALLED HIM IN FOR DINNER
AND HE DIDN'T MAKE IT HOME UNTIL
BREAKFAST THE NEXT MORNING
AND HE WAS ONLY A FOOT AWAY
BLUE POND WAS A NICE VILLAGE LOCATED ABOUT THREE DAYS CRAWL FROM GREAT POND
SEVEN
HUNDRED YEARS SO WITH SWISH THEY THOUGHT MAYBE JUST
MAYBE HE COULD BRING BACK THE TURTLE CUP TO THEIR POND
TO THEIR LITTLE POND
EVERYONE TREATED SWISH DIFFERENTLY FOR EXAMPLE
MR PEEKS THE LOCAL SHELL CLEANER WOULD SAY
HEY THERE SWISH DO YOU WANT
A FREE SHELL WAXING TODAY
WE ALL WANT YOU TO LOOK GOOD WHEN YOU BRING HOME THE CUP MRS S SNAPPER WOULD SAY
HI SWISHY DO YOU WANT SOME YUMMY PIE TO FILL YOU UP AND SLOW
YOU DOWN FOR THE BIG RACE A FAT TURTLE IS A SLOW TURTLE
THIS SNAPPER WAS NEVER NICE TO ANYONE BUT SHE WAS BEING NICE TO SWISH
MRS PEEKS
WOULD NEVER DO ANYTHING FOR FREE
BUT HE WAS GOING TO GIVE SWISH A FREE
SHELL WAXING
THIS WAS THE KIND OF THING THAT SWISH WOULD GET ALL THE TIME
ALL THE EXTRA ATTENTION MADE SWISH VERY UNCOMFORTABLE HE THOUGHT SURE
THEY ARE NICE TO ME NOW BECAUSE THEY THINK I CAN WIN THE RACE BUT IF I LOSE
THEY'LL BE DISAPPOINTED AND MAD AT ME I NEVER PROMISED THAT I WOULD WIN
THE RACE I CAN'T BEAT MUD ANYWAY I HEARD
ONCE IT TOOK HIM THREE DAYS JUST TO YAWN
SO ONE DAY HE TOLD HIS PARENTS I DON'T WANT TO RACE ALL THE TURTLES IN BLUE POND HELD A MEETING TO DISCUSS THE PROBLEM
THE MAYOR DR SOFTSHELL SAID THIS IS RIDICULOUS
SWISH WAS
HAS HEARD RACE HE'S THE SLOWEST TURTLE I'VE EVERY SEEN
EXCEPT FOR MUD OF COURSE
WITHOUT HIM WE DON'T HAVE A CHANCE BUT HE DOESN'T WANT TO BE TREATED SPECIAL HE JUST WANTS TO BE NORMAL AND HE DOESN'T WANT EVERYBODY TO HATE HIM IF HE CAN'T BEAT MUD
YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT EVEN THOUGH HE'S GIFTED
AT BE BEING SLOW
H HE'S STILL VERY YOUNG
SAID SWISH'S FATHER
WE NEVER THOUGHT OF THAT THEY ALL SAID THE TOWN AGREED TO TREAT SWISH LIKE A NORMAL TURTLE
AND AFTER A WHILE SWISH DECIDED THAT HE WOULD BE PROUD TO RACE FOR HIS VILLAGE AND THE TIME OF THE FESTIVAL
DREW NEAR ALL THE TURTLES IN THE LAND
STARTED TOWARD GREAT POND
SWISH HAD TO BE CARRIED ON HIS FATHER'S BACK SINCE IT WOULD HAVE TAKEN
HIM MONTHS TO GET TO GREAT POND BY HIMSELF
FINALLY AFTER THE LONG JOURNEY ALL THE TURTLES ARRIVED
AT GREAT POND
THIS WAS SWISH'S
FIRST EVER
SHELL DWELLERS FESTIVAL
AND HE THOUGHT IT WAS THE MOST WONDERFUL THING
HE HAD EVER SEEN
THERE WERE THOUSANDS OF TURTLES ALL OF ALL DIFFERENT S SPICES
ALL HAVING A GREAT TIME
LOOK THERE'S YOUR COUSIN
PEEK A BOO FROM BIG PUDDLE VILLAGE
SAID SWISH'S MOTHER YOU'LL GET TO MEET ALL SORTS OF NEW TURTLES
SWISH WAS SUDDENLY VERY EXCITED HE TOLD HIS MOM S
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M GOING TO WIN THIS RACE
I KNOW IT
AND ALL THESE TURTLES WILL KNOW THAT BLUE POND RULES
I'M NOT AFRAID OF STUPID MUD
SWISH'S MOM SMILED AND SAID
I KNOW THAT YOU CAN WIN SWISH BUT IT'S AN HONOR JUST TO GET
TO RACE
SAID SWISH'S MOM
SWISH SAW A ROCK IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FIELD AND WONDERED
HOW COME THEY DON'T MOVE THAT BIG ROCK
OUT OF THE FIELD
IT SEEMS TO BE IN EVERYONE'S WAY TO SWISH
THAT'S NOT A ROCK SWEETIE S SAID HIS MOM THAT'S MUD
SWISH MADE A LOUD GULP SOUND
JUST DO YOUR BEST SAID HIS MOM
SWISH'S FATHER SAID SON I HAVE SOMETHING TO TELL YOU
AS YOU KNOW IT YOUR GREAT GREAT GRAND TURTLE RACED MUD ONCE HE WASN'T AS SLOW AS YOU BUT HE DID TEACH ABOUT MUD'S DIRTY TRICKS THEN YOU WHISPERED IN
SWISH'S EAR
ALL
THE TRICKS THAT HIS
GREAT GREAT GRAND TURTLE TAUGHT HIM
AFTER SEVEN DAYS OF PLAYING AND DANCING AND BUG EATING FINALLY THE DAY OF THE RACE CA CAME THE MAYOR OF THE GREAT POND MISS
TORT POSTED THE RULES OF THE RACE ON A TREE FOR EVERYONE TO SEE
RULE NUMBER ONE
THE GREAT RACE BEGINS AT SUNRISE AND ENDS AT SUNSET
RULE NUMBER TWO ALL TURTLES MUST RUN AS FAST AS THEY CAN AND THE TURTLE THAT IS CLOSEST TO THE STARTING LINE WINS
RULE NUMBER THREE NO TURTLE MAY PRETEND TO
BE GOING FAST BUT GO SLOW INSTEAD
ALL TURTLES MUST GO AS FAST AS THEY
CAN
ALL AT ALL TIMES
SINCE TURTLES NEVER CHEAT THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT RULE
TO BREAK THIS RULE WOULD MEAN AN END TO THE GREAT TURTLE RACE FOREVER
RULE NUMBER FOUR NO TURTLE MAY FALL ASLEEP
SINCE IF
YOU ARE ASLEEP
YOU AREN'T RUNNING AS FAST AS YOU CAN
SWISH READ THE RULES EVEN
THOUGH HE KNEW
THEM BY HEART
THEN HE HEARD
THE MAYOR SAY RUNNER'S PLEASE TAKE YOUR POSITIONS THE SLOWEST TURTLES FROM EACH POND WERE CARRIED TO THE STARTING
LINE BY MEMBERS OF THEIR VILLAGES
THERE WERE ABOUT THREE HUNDRED TURTLES RACING
THE WERE
ALL THE SLOWEST OF THE SLOW
THE TURTLES ALL STRETCHED AND THOUGHT REALLY SLOW THOUGHTS
AS THEY
DID THE SKY TURNED
FROM BLACK TO DARK BLUE
THEY LOOKED AT THE HORIZON
AND SAW THE SUN WAS STARTING
THERE RISE JUST THEN THE MAYOR SAID READY SET SLOW AND OFF THEY WENT
ALL THE TURTLES WERE VERY VERY SLOW
SO IT TOOK SOME TIME BEFORE ANYONE COULD FIGURE OUT WHICH TURTLES WERE THE MOST SLOWEST AFTER A FEW HOURS
MOST OF THE TURTLES HAD GONE A FEW FEET ALL EXCEPT TWO SWISH AND MUD
WERE BOTH BACK AT THE STARTING LINE
IT LOOKED AS IF NEITHER OF THEM HAD MOVED AT ALL
THEY WERE BOTH MOVING OF COURSE BUT THEY WERE S SO SLOW THAT IT WAS HARDLY TO TELL AFTER SIX HOURS MUD AND SWISH WERE STILL
TIED AND HAD ONLY MOVED A FEW INCHES
BY NOW ALL THE TURTLES WERE USUALLY WAY AHEAD OF MUD
BUT THIS TIME SWISH WAS JUST AS SLOW
MUD KNEW THAT THIS WOULD BE HIS CLOSEST RACE EVER AND HE WAS ACTUALLY GETTING A LITTLE BIT SCARED
WHO IS THIS YOUNG PUNK HE THOUGHT TO HIMSELF
MUD SAID TO SWISH THERE'S NO WAY THAT A TURTLE AS YOUNG
AS YOU CAN BE SO SLOW EVEN I WAS
FASTER THAN YOU
WHEN I WAS YOUR AGE YOU'RE CHEATING
YOU'RE GOING TO RUIN THE GREAT RACE FOREVER
BUT SWISH WOULDN'T LET MUD SCARE HIM
YOU'RE JUST TRYING TO MAKE ME QUIT
I'M NOT GOING TO FALL FOR YOUR TRICKS HE SAID
TURTLES NEVER CHEAT AND I'M A TURTLE WITH HONOR
THEN MUD TRIED
ANOTHER TRICK
HE STARTED SINGING A SOFT BEAUTIFUL B
SWISH STARTED YAWNING
HE WAS TIRED
HE WAS TIRED FROM RACING AND THOUGHT THAT IT WOULD BE NICE TO JUST LISTEN TO MUD'S SWEET VOICE AND FALL ASLEEP
THEN HE SNAPPED OUT OF IT AND REMEMBERED HIS FATHER HAD WARNED HIM OF H THIS TRICK
HE REACHED IN HIS SHELL AND PULLED OUT A COUPLE OF EARPLUGS
HE PUT THE EARPLUGS ON HIS EARS AND COULDN'T HEAR MUD'S SINGING ANYMORE MUD KEPT SINGING HIS LULLABY FOR A FEW HOURS BUT HE STOPPED RIGHT BEFORE SUNSET
THE CROWD THOUGHT HE MUST HAVE REALIZED
THAT HIS SINGING TRICK WASN'T WORKING
BUT THEN RIGHT AS THE END
BUT THEN RIGHT AT THE END RIGHT BEFORE THE SUNSET
SWISH
STARTED TO PULL AHEAD OF MUD
OH NO SHOUTED THE FANS MUD'S WINNING IT LOOKS LIKE MUD IS STILL THE GREATEST TURTLE OF THEM ALL
AND WHEN THE SUN WENT DOWN MUD WAS THE CLOSEST TURTLE TO THE STARTING LINE
SWISH WAS SAD THAT HE LOST BUT AL ALL THE TURTLES FROM BLUE POND CHEERED
FOR SWISH THEY WERE VERY PROUD HE GAVE MUD SUCH
A CLOSE RACE
SWISH WAS T HAPPY TOO BUT DEEP DOWN INSIDE HE KNEW HE WAS JUST AS SLOW AS MUD
THE MAYOR OF PONDLAND WENT TO PRESENT
THE TURTLE CUP TO SLUDGE POND AGAIN
SHE ANNOUNCED
WELL MUD IT LOOKS LIKE
YOU'VE DONE IT SLUDGE POND WINS
THE TURTLE CUP AGAIN THIS TIME IT WAS A BIT CLOSER
THAN YOU WOULD HAVE LIKED
HELLO BET
WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO SAY
TO ALL THE TURTLES AT THE FESTIVAL THE CROWD STARTED YELLING SPEECH SPEECH
MUD DIDN'T ANSWER THE MAYOR TAPPED MUD
ON THE SHELL AND SAID HELLO HELLO MUD
MUD STILL DIDN'T ANSWER IN FACT MUD WAS SOUND ASLEEP
MUD HAD ACTUALLY SUNG HIMSELF TO SLEEP
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN
SHE SAID
MUD FROM SLUDGE POND HAS BEEN
DIS
<unk>
FOR
SLEEPING DURING THE RACE THIS MEANS THAT WE HAVE A NEW CHAMPION
THE REAL WINNER IS SWISH
SOFTBELLY OF BLUE POND THE CROWD WENT WILD
MRS T
ORT FOR WENT UP TO SWISH AND GAVE HIM THE TURTLE CUP SHE SAID SWISH YOU ARE THE YOUNGEST WINNER OF THE GREAT TURTLE
RACE THAT WAS THE MOST EXCITING FINISH WE'VE EVER HAD
I THINK THAT YOU'LL BE A GREAT CHAMPION
FOR MANY YEARS SINCE TURTLES ONLY GET
SLOWER WITH AGE
FOR THE FIRST TIME IN SIX HUNDRED YEARS
I WOULD LIKE TO PRESENT THE TURTLE CUP TO BLUE POND THE CROWD WENT WILD AGAIN
SWISH TOOK THE CUP THAT DAY F FOR THE FIRST TIME
HE WOULD TAKE IT MANY MORE TIMES AFTER THAT
IT WAS BECAUSE OF SWISH THAT
BLUE POND BECAME
THE MOST RESPECTED POND IN THE LAND
HE WOULD NEVER LOSE THE TURTLE CUP FOR THE REST OF HIS LONG LIFE
BUT THOUGH
BECAME THE GREATEST HE BECAME THE GREATEST AND BIGGEST TURTLE OF ALL TIME MUCH GREATER OR BIGGER THAN MUD HE ALWAYS MADE
SURE THAT NO ONE
TREATED HIM SPECIAL
AND THAT HE TREATED EVERYBODY LIKE HE WANTED TO BE TREATED LIKE A TURTLE WITH HONOR
UH THE UHM TURTLE UH HE UHM HE HE WAS BORN AND HE HEARD ABOUT UHM MUD SO UHM THEN
SIL

SO HE WENT TO THE FOREST HOPPING
AND FLUTTERING WITH HIS BROKEN WING FIRST HE CAME TO WAS A SILVER
BIRCH
BEAUTIFUL BIRCH TREE HE SAID

BRYAN AND JUDY ANN WERE BEST FRIENDS
THEY LIVED NEXT DOOR TO EACH OTHER IN A SMALL TOWN WEST OF
NEW ORLEANS
LOUISIANA
A CREEK RAN BEHIND THEIR HOUSES
AT NIGHT JUDY ANN AND BRYAN
COULD HEAR THE SOUNDS OF THE FROGS AND INSECTS THAT LIVED NEAR THE CREEK
ONE SATURDAY JUDY ANN AND BRYAN WERE RIDING THEIR BICYCLES
THEY WERE CROSSING THE BRIDGE OVER THE CREEK WHEN SUDDENLY BRYAN STOPPED WHAT'S UP
ASKED JUDY
THERE'S SOMETHING DOWN IN THE CREEK
SEE
SEE
IT LOOKS LIKE A BUMPY OLD LOG
THEY BOTH JUMPED BACK WHEN
WHEN THE LOG SPLASHED AND DRAGGED ITSELF UP THE BANK
WOW
I'VE SEEN ALLIGATORS BEFORE BUT NEVER THIS CLOSE BRYAN SAID
SURE ENOUGH A BIG ALLIGATOR WAS WRESTLING ON THE BANK OF THE CREEK
OF THEIR CREEK
IT WAS BLACK AND TAN
ITS WET BUMPY
HIDE SHONE
IN THE SUN
THEN IT CRAWLED BACK INTO THE MUDDY WATER
ONLY ITS HEAD STILL T SHOWED
I WANT THAT ALLIGATOR
I DON'T WANT THAT ALLIGATOR GETTING C
GETTING CASSIE
I'M
MY CAT
DECLARED JUDY
ANN
MAYBE WE CAN HELP IT GET BACK WHERE IT BELONGS
OK
LET'S GO GO GET MY DAD SAID BRYAN
MR DEGAS
LISTENED TO THE CHILDREN'S
BREATHLESS N NEWS
WHAT DO WE DO ASKED BRYAN
LET'S CALL THE FIRE DEPARTMENT
SAID JUDY ANN
NOW THAT'S A GOOD IDEA ANSWERED MR DEGAS
MR DEGAS
D
<unk>
THE EMERGENCY NUMBER
AND
EXPLAINED ABOUT THE ALLIGATOR
CALL DR BOB THOMAS
THE FIREMAN SAID
NATURE AND SCIENCE CENTER
DR THOMAS IS A SCIENTIST
HE KNOWS ABOUT REPTILES
IN A TRUCK THAT HAD WILDLIFE RESCUE PAINTED ON IT
THE TRUCK PULLED A TRAILER WITH A BOAT
BRYAN AND JUDY ANN LOOKED UP
AT DR THOMAS
HE WAS VERY TALL
HE SMILED THROUGH THE
THROUGH THE CURLY BROWN AND GRAY BEARD
COME SEE THE ALLIGATOR JUDY ANN CRIED
IT INVITED
IT
INVITED
OUR NEIGHBORHOOD
SAID BRYAN
IT INVADED OUR NEIGHBORHOOD SAID BRYAN
DR THOMAS LAUGHED
ALLIGATORS LIVE H LIVED HERE
LONG BEFORE PEOPLE DID
DR
YOU MIGHT SAY WIN
WHAT INVADED
ITS NEIGHBORHOOD
DR THOMAS
EXPLAINED THAT HE WAS GOING TO CATCH THE ALLIGATOR AND TAKE IT TO A PLACE FAR AWAY FROM WHERE PEOPLE LIVED
HE TOOK A LONG POLE OUT OF HIS
TRUCK
THE POLE HAD
LOTS
ON EACH END
OUR USE THIS TO CATCH THE ALLIGATOR HE SAID
THE HANDLE IS SQUARE TO KEEP THE POLE FROM
TWISTING WHILE
I USE IT
WHY IS ONE LOOP BIGGER THAN THE OTHER ASKED JUDY ANN
BECAUSE ALLIGATORS COME IN DIFFERENT SIZES
ANSWERED DR THOMAS
ALLIGATORS CAN RUN FOR ONLY A SHORT DISTANCE BUT THEY CAN RUN FAST
SO WHY DON'T YOU STAND A LITTLE FATHER AWAY IF YOU WANT TO WATCH CONTINUED DR THOMAS AS HE WALKED DOWN TOWARD THE ANIMAL
WHAT DO ALLIGATORS EAT ASKED BRYAN
WELL DR THOMAS ANSWERED
TURTLES OR SNAKE AND SNAKES
I'LL BET IT'S WAITING FOR ITS LUNCH RIGHT NOW
SAID BRYAN USUALLY DR SAID DR THOMAS EXPLAINED WHEN AN ALLIGATOR WANTS TO EAT
IT WAITS QUIETLY IN THE WATER
UNTIL SOMETHING COMES BY
THEN THE ALLIGATOR SNAPS UP MEAT
MEAL
AND TOSSES IT DOWN
ITS THROAT
BUT ONCE THE JAWS ARE
SHUT
I CAN EASILY HOLD THEM CLOSED
OTHERWISE IT WOULD BE TOO DANGEROUS TO CATCH BY HAND
I WOULD HAVE TO USE A TRAP
DR THOMAS LOOKED
TOOK SOME BIG
BLACK RUBBER
FROM HIS POCKET
SEE THEIR BIG SEE THESE BANDS
HE ASKED
DR THOMAS PULLED ON HIS
HIGH BLACK BOOTS
HE EASED HIMSELF GENTLY
INTO THE CREEK'S BROWN WATER
SLOWLY NOW
DON'T
SEND THE WAVES TO
WARN
THE ALLIGATOR
TO WARN THE ALLIGATOR
HE SAID TO HIMSELF
DR THOMAS SET
HIS FEET FIRMLY ON THE TOP MUDDY BOTTOM
AND GENTLY
SLIPPED
THE
ANIMAL TURNED HIS DARK EYES TOWARD DR THOMAS AND TRIED TO DIVE
AS IT STRUGGLED
FIERCELY
TO GET AWAY THE LOOP CLOSED TIGHTLY AROUND ITS NECK
DR THOMAS PULLED THE ALLIGATOR TO THE SURFACE AND DRAGGED IT TO SHORE
THERE WAS
THERE HE WAS ABLE TO SIT ON THE ALLIGATOR
HE TRIED
HE TIED UP HIS
ITS FRONT
AND BACK LEGS
NEXT HE LOOPED
HE QUICKLY PULLED A BLACK RUBBER
FINALLY THE ALLIGATOR GREW TOO TIRED TO STRUGGLE
DR THOMAS HAD CAPTURED THE ALLIGATOR
NOW IT WAS TIME TO PUT THE ALLIGATOR
IN THE BOAT AND BRING IT
TO A NEW HOME
DEEP IN THE SWAMP
DR THOMAS WOULD FIND A PLACE WHERE IT WOULD BE
FAR FROM PEOPLE
BRYAN AND JUDY ANN LOOKED
AT THE ALLIGATOR
THEN THEY LOOKED AT EACH OTHER
THEY HAD HEARD PLENTY
OF ALLIGATOR
STORIES FROM THEIR PARENTS
AND GRANDPARENTS
NOW THEY HAD T TA A TALE OF THEIR OWN TO TELL
AND FOUND AN ALLIGATOR IN THE CREEK AND THEY ASKED THEIR DAD TO CALL THE FIRE DEPARTMENT AND THE FIRE DEPARTMENT TOLD THEM TO CALL A GUY NAMED DOCTOR THOMAS DOCTOR THOMAS CAPTURED THE ALLIGATOR TO AND T IS GOING TO MOVE IT TO A NEW ENCLOSURE
SIL
DOCTOR THOMAS CAPTURED THE ALLIGATOR BY PUTTING A LOOP AROUND ITS NECK AND A BLACK RUBBER BAND AROUND ITS NOSE

SIL
UHM TO UHM IF HE WANTED TO HELP HIM MAKE A CRUTCH SO HE COULD WALK
AND WHEN THEY FIND THE BUSH TH THEY WERE THINKING WHAT THEY SHOULD NAME IT SINCE PETE FOUND IT S AND PETE UHM UHM THOUGHT ABOUT THE PRESIDENT UHM
SIL
UHM BEN BEN FRANKLIN IF HE IF HE UHM
SIL
M AS
A PUPPY
WAS VERY DIRTY SO HIS
OWNERS NAMED HIM FLEABAG
HE SOON LEARNED THAT WHENEVER HIS OWNER SAID
FLEABAG CAME HE WOULD SOMETIMES GET A YUMMY
BAG
THAT WAS A LONG TIME AGO WHEN
WAS A PUPPY HE WAS OLDER NOW AND HAD PROBLEMS WITH
HIS BACK
LEGS
THAT MADE HIM
LIMP
WHEN HE RAN
BUT THAT DIDN'T STOP HIM FROM RUNNING
LIKE MOST DOGS HE LOVED TO RUN
THERE WAS A DOG PARK NEAR WHERE HE LIVED HE ENJOYED PLAYING WITH THE OTHER DOGS BECAUSE HE DIDN'T
HAVE TO BE ON HIS LEASH AT THE DOG PARK
THERE WAS ONE DOG NAMED SNOT
THAT WOULD ALWAYS COME UP TO FLEABAG AND BITE
HIS BACK LEG AND RUN AWAY SAYING BARK BARK BARK
BARK
WHICH IN DOG TALK MEANS YOU'RE ARE S TOO SLOW TO CATCH ME WITH YOUR LIMP
SO I'M GOING TO PICK UP
ON
YOUR
FLEABAG
WOULD ALWAYS FLEABAG
WOULD ALWAYS CHASE SNOT BUT COULD NEVER CATCH HIM
ONE DAY FLEABAG WENT TO THE VET
FLEABAG DIDN'T MIND THE V
VET BECAUSE UNUSUALLY THE PEOPLE IN THE WHITE
COATS
GAVE HIM A TREAT
TS
FLEABAG
WAS AT THE V
VET
TO HAVE S SURGERY ON HIS LEGS WHEN HE AWOKE
FROM THE SURGERY HE DIDN'T REMEMBER WHERE HE WAS BUT HE SURE DID WANT TO SEE HIS OWNERS SOON THEY CAME AND PICKED
HIM UP AND DROVE HIM HOME
FLEABAG SUDDENLY REALIZED THAT HIS LEGS
ITCHED VERY BADLY HE THOUGHT
OH
HE THOUGHT
OH BOY I'M GOING TO LICK MY LEG SO HARD THAT THE ITCHING IS GOING TO GO AWAY SO HE TURNED HIS HEAD AROUND
TO LICK HIS LEGS BUT THERE WAS A BIG WHITE
THING IN HIS WAY
HE WAS WEARING A COLLAR THAT MADE IT IMPOSSIBLE TO LICK
ITS LEGS THEN IT LEGS
THE NEXT DAY HE
WAS WALKING WITH HIS
OWNERS ON HIS LEASH AND THEY WENT TO
THE DOG PARK
HIS OWNERS WOULDN'T LET
FLEABAG PLAY WITHOUT THE LEASH SINCE HE STILL
NEEDED TO
HE
HEAL BUT
IT ALWAYS IT WAS NICE
TO SEE ALL HIS FRIENDS MEAN OLD SNOT
SAID BARK
BARK
BARK BARK
WHICH MEANS IN DOG TALK WHY DO YOU HAVE TO WEAR MY STUPID LOOKING COLLAR
BOY
DO YOU LOOK SILLY IN THAT UGLY COLLAR HA HA
HA HA HA
EVENTUALLY
FLEABAG GOT TO TAKE
THE COLLAR
OFF BUT
BY THEN
THE LEGS DIDN'T ITCH SO HE DIDN'T WANT TO LICK THEM FOR SIX WEEKS HE COULD TAKE WALKS
AND GO TO THE DOG PARK BUT HE
COULDN'T
BE LET OFF HIS LEASH WHEN
WHICH MADE HIM
A LITTLE MAD AT HIS OWNERS ONE DAY HE TOOK A WALK TO THE DOG PARK AND ALL HIS FRIENDS WERE THERE
AS USUAL
VERY COM
FAIRLY
HIS OWNERS REACHED AROUND THE BAG
AND TOOK A
HIS LEASH OFF
FLEABAG DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO BECAUSE HE HAD BEEN ON HIS LEASH SO LONG JUST THEN SNOT
BIT HIM ON THE BACK LEG AND RAN AWAY
REALIZE WHICH MEANT HE WAS
ALL
OWED
ALL
ALLOWED
IT'S CAUSE THE WORDS ARE SO SMALL AND MY EYES ARE SO SMALL
HE WAS ALLOWED TO RUN SO
FLEABAG STARTED RUNNING AFTER SNOT
SNOT WAS
WHAT
LA
<unk> BECAUSE HE KNEW FLEABAG COULD NEVER CATCH HIM
BUT SUDDENLY HE NOTICED THAT FLEABAG WAS CATCHING UP TO HIM AND BEFORE

WHEN HIS OWNERS GOT HIM AS A PUPPY
ALL HE WANTED TO DO WAS RUN RUN SO HIS OWNERS NAMED HIM RACER
WHEN
WHEN HE GOT OLDER
HE HE DEVELOPED PROBLEMS WITH HIS BACK LEGS EVERY TIME HE RAN
AND WOULD LIMP
BUT THAT DIDN'T STOP HIM FROM RUNNING BECAUSE
H LIKE
HE LIKE MOST DOGS RACER LOVED TO RUN
THERE WERE
A DOG
THERE WAS A DOG IN
IN A PARK NEAR WHERE HE LIVED
HE ENJOYED PLAYING AT THE DOG PARK BECAUSE HE DIDN'T HAVE TO
BE ON HIS LEASH WHEN HE WAS THERE
THERE
SO HE COULD RUN AS MUCH AS HE LIKED
THERE'S AS WAS ONE DOG AT THE PARK NAMED FANG
HE WOULD ALWAYS
COME UP TO RACER AND BITE HIS BACK LEGS AND RUN AWAY SAYING BARK BARK BARK BARK WHICH WHICH IN DOG TALK
MEANT YOU ARE TOO SLOW TO CATCH ME
WITH THAT LIMP OF YOURS SO I'M GOING TO PICK ON YOU
RACER ALWAYS CHASED FANG BUT HE COULD NEVER CATCH HIM
ONE DAY RACER WENT TO THE VET
RACER LIKED T THE VET
LIKED THE VET BECAUSE PEOPLE IN WHITE
COSTUMES GAVE HIM TREATS BUT RACER DIDN'T
S BUT RACER DIDN'T RACER DIDN'T KNOW IT BUT HE WAS AT THE VET TO
TO HAVE SURGERY TO FIX HIS LEGS
WHEN HE WOKE UP FROM HIS SURGERY HE DIDN'T EVEN REMEMBER WHERE HE WAS BUT SOON HIS OWNERS CAME AND DROVE HIM HOME
ON THE DAY HOME <unk>
IT
ON A BIG
ON THE DRIVE HOME
RACER REALIZED HIS LEGS ITCHED VERY BADLY
HE THOUGHT OH BOY I'M GOING TO LICK MY LEG SO HARD THAT THE ITCHING IS GOING TO GO AWAY SO HE TURNED HIS HEAD AROUND TO LICK HIS LEGS BUT THERE WAS A BIG WHITE
THING IN HIS WAY
HOW
HOW WAS WHERE
HE WAS WEARING
A
COLLAR THAT MADE IT IMPOSSIBLE TO LICK HIS LEGS
A FEW DAYS LATER HE WENT TO THE OWNERS
HE WENT WITH HIS OWNERS TO THE DOG PUT
DOG PARK
RACERS HAD
HAD TO BE ON A LEASH SINCE HE STILL NEED TO HEAL
FROM HIS SURGERY BUT IT WAS NICE TO SEE ALL HIS FRIENDS
MEAN OLD FANG SAID BARK BARK BARK BARK WHICH MEANT
WHY
WHICH MEANT
WHY DO YOU HAVE
HAVE
HAVE TO WEAR THAT STUPID
LOOKING COLLAR
SURE
DOES
SURE DOES LOOK SILLY
EVENTUALLY
RACER DIDN'T HAVE TO WEAR
THE COLLAR BUT BY THEN HIS LEGS DIDN'T ITCH
SO HE DIDN'T WANT TO LICK THEM FOR SIX WE WEEKS
RACER WOULD TAKE WALKS AND
GO TO THE DOG PARK
AND
BUT HE STILL
HAD
TO BE ON A LEASH
ONE DAY HE TOOK
A WALK
THROUGH THE DOG PARK AS HIS FRIENDS WERE
THERE
AS USUAL
THEN HIS OWNERS REACHED OUT AROUND
OUT AROUND HIS NECK
AND TOOK OFF HIS LEASH
JUST THEN FANG BIT HIM ON THE BACK LEG AND RAN AWAY
RAN AWAY RACER'S OWNERS
JUST THEN FANG BIT BIT HIM ON THE BACK LEG AND RAN AWAY
OH ANOTHER TYPO
SO RACER'S OWNERS
SAID GO RUN
SO RACER STARTED RUNNING AND CHASING FANG
FANG WAS LAUGHING BECAUSE HE KNEW
KNEW RACER COULD NEVER CATCH HIM BUT SUDDENLY HE NOTICED THAT RACER WAS CATCHING UP
RACER WAS CATCHING UP TO HIM
RACER WAS RUNNING
FASTER THAN HE EVER
REMEMBER AND BEFORE
HE KNEW IT HE CAUGHT
UP TO FANG AND KNOCKED HIM DOWN
RACER SAID BARK BARK AND WHICH IN
DOG TALK MEANS DON'T
PICK ON ME ANY MORE FANG
AND FROM THAT DAY ON FANG NEVER BIT RACER'S LEGS AND RACER WAS
SO HAPPY THAT HE COULD RUN FAST
THAT
HE
RAN AND RAN IN CIRCLES
FINALLY
HE RAN BACK TO HIS OWNERS AND GAVE THEM BIG KISSES FOR FIXING HIS LEGS
RACER UH PRETTY MUCH HE HURT HIS LEGS
SIL
SO
SIL
HE NEEDED THEM TO BE FIXED
SIL
AND HE GOT THEM FIXED SO HE CHASED AFTER FANG
SIL
BECAUSE HE NEEDED THEM HE NEEDED TO GET BACK AT FANG

SIL

SIL
A SAFE TRIP NOT THAT'S NOT UHM LUCK
BEFORE ROOS BEFORE I TELL YOU HOW ROOSTER JOHN
GOT HIS NAME YOU SHOULD KNOW A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE TOWN OF FRANKSVILLE FRANKSVILLE WAS A TOWN THAT SEEMED TO HAVE NO PROBLEM AFTER THE OTHER
THEIR PROBLEMS WERE STARTED WHEN THEY RAN OUT OF WATER THANKFULLY SOMEONE WAS DIGGING A HOLE AND FOUND WATER
BUT SOON AFTER THEY STARTED TO GET FLY
FLEAS
FLIES THEY GOT TONS AND TONS OF FLIES THEN THE FLIES STOPPED BUT JUST THEN A MAN MOVED TO TOWN WHO PLAYED THE FLUTE SO BADLY THAT PEOPLE WOULD RUN AWAY SCREAMING
MAYBE A POORLY PLAYED FLUTE DOESN'T SOUND THAT BAD BUT IT JUST
JUST TRY TO IMAGINE SOMEONE SCRATCHING A CHALKBOARD WITH A FORK
AND THEN MULTIPLY
THAT TIMES A HUNDRED
THAT'S HOW THE FLUTE SOUNDED
WHEN THIS GUY PLAYED IT I'M SERIOUS STILL IT'S NOT AS BAD AS MILLIONS OF FLIES I SUPPOSE
THE BAD FLUTE PLAYER WAS ROOSTER JOHN HE WASN'T CALLED ROOSTER JOHN YET THAT CAME LATER HE WAS THE NEW TOWN DENTIST HE WAS AN EXCELLENT DENTIST
BUT
HIS REAL LOVE WAS MUSIC HE PLAYED MANY MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS SUCH AS THE GUITAR THE TUBA THE PIANO
AND THE CLARINET HOW HOWEVER FOR SOME REASON
THIS WAY HIS MOUTH WAS SHAPED
MADE THIS FLUTE SOUND AWFUL
WE CAN'T LET YOU PLAY THE FLUTE ANYMORE JOHN
THE POLICE CHIEF
CHIEF SANDERS
THE NEIGHBORS ARE COMPLAINING AND THE CATS AND DOGS ARE TRYING TO CHEW OFF THEIR EARS BUT I HAVE TO PLAY
I WAS BORN TO DO IT I DON'T KNOW WHY BUT I FEEL LIKE I HAVE TO OR ELSE BAD THINGS WILL HAPPEN
LOOK JOHN I'VE HEARD YOU PLAY THE CLARINET YOU'RE QUITE GOOD WHY DON'T YOU PLAY THAT INSTEAD SAID CHIEF SANDERS OH THAT'S A NICE INSTRUMENT BUT IT'S NOT THE FLUTE
I
EVEN WROTE YOU A SONG CHIEF SANDERS IT'S CALLED COPS AND ROBBERS THEN HE PLAYED THE SONG THE POLICE CHIEF HATED THE SOUND SO MUCH THAT HE THREW JOHN IN JAIL
WHAT THEY COULDN'T KEEP JOHN IN JAIL SINCE HE WAS REALLY S SINCE HE WASN'T REALLY BREAKING ANY LAWS SO
THERE WAS NOTHING THE POLICE COULD DO BESIDES EVERYBODY LOVED JOHN SINCE HE HAD BECOME THE TOWN DENTIST EVERYBODY'S TEETH WERE MUCH WHITER AND CLEANER
AND NO ONE HAD CAVITIES SO THERE WAS A PROBLEM IN THE LITTLE TOWN OF FRANKSVILLE WHAT SHOULD THEY DO THEY COULDN'T KEEP JOHN IN JAIL
AND THEY DIDN'T WANT TO KICK HIM OUT OF TOWN BECAUSE
THEY ALL HAD SUCH NICE TEETH SO
SO THEY DECIDED THAT JOHN COULD PLAY THE FLUTE AND EVERYBODY ELSE WOULD HAVE TO WEAR EARPLUGS WELL I'M SURE YOU GUESSED THAT
DIDN'T WORK NO ONE COULD HEAR
ANYTHING PEOPLE WERE GETTING IN
INTO CAR ACCIDENTS AND EVERYBODY LOOKED REALLY SILLY AT DANCES DANCING TO THE MUSIC THEY COULDN'T HEAR
THEY JUST COULDN'T LEAD A NORMAL LIFE THEN THEY DECIDED TO LOWER HIM DOWN
A WELL AND LET HIM PLAY DOWN WHERE NO ONE COULD HEAR HIM JOHN THOUGHT
THAT WAS AN OK IDEA BUT THERE WAS AN ECHO IN THE WELL THAT MADE HIS FLUTE SOUND LOUDER WINDOWS WERE BREAKING AND ALL THE COWS IN TOWN STARTED TO MAKE SOUR MILK
THE LOCAL SCIENTIST DR WONG CAME
WHAT UP WITH AN IDEA HE THOUGHT THAT IF HE MADE A NEW MOUTHPIECE ESPECIALLY SHAPED FOR
JOHN'S MOUTH THEN PERHAPS HE COULD PLAY THE FLUTE NORMALLY
AND GUESS WHAT IT WORKED DR WONG WAS THE TOWN HERO THE FLUTE SOUNDED NORMAL AND IT TURNED OUT JOHN COULD PLAY IT QUITE WELL PEOPLE IN THE TOWN DECIDED TO HAVE A BIG
A GREAT BIG PARADE IN FRANKSVILLE TO CELEBRATE THE FACT THAT FOR ONCE THERE WAS NO WATER PROBLEM NO FLY PR PROBLEM NO FLUTE
PROBLEM
DR WONG AND JOHN WERE THE STARS OF THE PARADE
THEY WERE UP ON THE MAIN FLOAT
AND BIG BAND
A BIG BAND PLAYED AS THEY MARCHED UP AND
AND DOWN MAIN STREET EVERYONE CHEERED SUDDENLY A FLY LANDED ON A LITTLE GIRL THEN A FLY LANDED ON SOMEONE ELSE
THEN SOMEONE LANDED ON SOME LANDED ON A BUNCH OF PEOPLE
THEN PRETTY SOON TONS OF FLIES WERE LANDING ON EVERYONE BEFORE THEY KNEW IT THE TOWN WAS FILLED WITH FLIES AGAIN OH NO THE CHIEF SANDERS IT'S JUST WHEN
THINGS WERE GOING GOOD FOR FRANKSVILLE
JOHN DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO SO JUST KEPT ON PLAYING HIS FLUTE THE FLIES WERE ANNOYING SO IT WOULD SWAT THEM
WITH HIS HAND OR EVEN HIS NEW FLUTE HE STARTED SHAKING THE FLUTE TO GET HIS FLIES
AND ACCIDENTALLY SMASHED IT INTO PIECES HE WAS VERY UPSET AT FIRST THEN HE SAID OH WELL GOOD THING I BROUGHT MY OLD
FLUTE
AS BACK UP
FOLK
HEARD THE NOISE THEY COULDN'T EVEN SWAT THE FLIES ANYMORE
THEY HAD TO COVER THEIR EARS FROM THE HORRIBLE SOUND THE FLIES
WOULD LAND ALL OVER THE PEOPLE AND THEY COULDN'T SWAT THEM OFF IT WAS GROSS SUDDENLY THE FLIES FLEW AWAY AS FAST AS THEY COULD DR WONG FOR THE SECOND PRONOUNCED
IT'S THE FLUTE SOUND THE FLIES HATE JOHN'S FLUTE PLAYING AS MUCH AS WE DO JOHN IS THE DENTIST IS DRIVING THE FLIES AWAY
F
IT WAS THEN THAT THE PEOPLE OF FRANKSVILLE REALIZED THEY WOULD HAVE TO TAKE THE GOOD WITH THE BAD BECAUSE
AS BAD AS THE FLUTE SOUNDED IT WAS A LOT BETTER THAN A THOUSAND OF FLIES CRAWLING ON THEM
FROM THEN ON JOHN WOULD WAKE UP AT SUNRISE
LIKE A ROOSTER AND PLAYED
AND PLAY TO KEEP THE FLIES AWAY
SHOULD I PRESS END
SIL
UHM THERE WERE LOTS OF FLIES UHM WHEN SOMEBODY FOUND WATER AND THEN
CAME ALONG AND UHM
<br>
HE AND HE PLAYED THE UHM FLUTE SO BAD THAT ALL THE FLIES HATED THE MUSIC AND SO THEY LEFT AND UHM WHEN THEY LEFT UH WHEN THE FLIES LEFT THE TOWNSPEOPLE WERE HAPPY BUT THEY STILL DIDN'T LIKE THE MUSIC SO THEY TRIED SO UH MISTER WONG MADE UHM A UHM NEW FLUTE A NEW MOUTH PIECE FOR THE FLUTE FOR THE FOR ROOSTER AND FOR THE GUY AND THEN UHM WHEN HE PLAYED IT
UHM THE I THINK THAT THE FLIES LIKED IT AND THEN SO THEN THEY CAME BACK AND THEY DIDN'T LIKE THE OTHER NOISE SO WHEN THE OTHER GUY WHEN THE GUY PLAYED SO THEN THEY LEFT
WOW THAT IS REALLY WEIRD
VICTOR
WEIRD
ASKED YES
VICTOR GARCIA SAID TO HIS MOTHER AND HIS FRIEND TOMMY
IT SURE IS
SAID TOMMY
IT LOOKS LIKE A SPACE CREATURE
THAT SPIDER IS NO SPACE CREATURE BUT SHE IS DANGEROUS
SAID
MR FOSTER
THE PARK RANGER
WHAT KIND OF SPIDER IS SHE ASKED VICTOR
BLACK WIDOW MR FOSTER ANSWERED
LET'S GO BOYS SAID MRS
GARCIA
I'M SURE MR FOSTER HAS MANY OTHER
INTERESTING THINGS TO SHOW US
MR FOSTER ENJOYED TAKING SUMMER VISITORS
THROUGH THE VISITORS CENTER AT STATE
IT THE STATE PARK
AS THEY WALKED THROUGH THE CENTER HE TOLD
VICTOR AND TOMMY A STORY ABOUT A SUPER SPIDER
THAT SPUN GIANT WEBS AND TRICKED BIGGER ANIMALS
NOW VICTOR WAS MORE CURIOUS THAN EVER ABOUT SPIDERS
I'VE
GOT JUST THE BOOK FOR YOU VICTOR MR FOSTER SAID
IT IS CALLED SPIDER FROM A TO Z
IT IS A GOOD BOOK TO BRING ON A
SPIDER HUNT
MR FOSTER SMILED
HEY WOULD YOU LIKE TO GO ON A SPIDER HUNT TOMORROW OH YES VICTOR SAID TOMMY SH
SHOUTED
SOMETHING HAPPENED
LIKE
SLY HUNTERS THEY SNEAKED THROUGH THE TALL WET GRASS
SOON VICTOR
SPOTTED A FUNNEL SHAPED WEB IN THE GRASS
IN THE CENTER OF THE WEB SAT A SPIDER
YOU'D BETTER WATCH OUT VICTOR TOMMY WARNED
IT MIGHT BE A BLACK WIDOW MR FOSTER SMILED
WHY DON'T YOU CHECK IN THE BOOK TO SEE WHAT KIND OF SPIDER IT IS
YOU DON'T WANT TO TOUCH AN ANIMAL OR PLANT UNTIL YOU KNOW IT'S HARMLESS
TOMMY AND VICTOR STUDIED THE SPIDER BOOK
IT'S A FUNNEL WEAVER
VICTOR SAID AT LAST
NOT A BLACK WIDOW
BLACK WIDOWS DON'T MAKE WEBS LIKE THIS
VERY GOOD SAID MR FOSTER
FUNNEL WEAVERS ARE N
NON POISONOUS
THE BOYS AND MR F
FOSTER WATCHED THE SPIDER FOR SEVERAL MINUTES
THEN MR FOSTER HAD TO LEAVE
AS SOON AS MR FOSTER LEFT
VICTOR GOT AN IDEA
QUICK HE SAID TO TOMMY
RUN BACK TO THE HOUSE
MOM DAD VICTOR SHOUTED WHEN THEY ARRIVED
I FOUND A SPIDER IN THE GRASS
MAY I KEEP IT
I WANT TO WATCH IT TO SEE HOW IT LIVES
IT'S A HO
IT'S A
HOLD ON SAID DAD
WHERE WILL YOU KEEP IT
IN MY OLD AQUARIUM VICTOR REPLIED
OK VICTOR SAID MR GARCIA A SPIDER WILL BE FUN TO WATCH BUT YOU MUST TAKE CARE OF IT AND FEED IT
THE BOYS WENT WITH MR GARCIA
TO THE BARN
AND FOUND THE AQUARIUM
THEY COVERED THE BOTTOM
WITH
MOSS GRASS AND STONES
THEY COVERED THE TOP
WITH A WIRE SCREEN THEN THE BOYS RETURNED TO THE
ORCHARD TO CAPTURE THE SPIDER
VICTOR CARRIED THE SPIDER
TO THE HOUSE IN A SHOEBOX
THEN HE CAREFULLY
TIPPED THE BOX OVER AND THE SPIDER FELL SOFTLY ONTO THE
MOSS INSIDE THE AQUARIUM
YOU KNOW WHAT
TOMMY
VICTOR SAID I THINK I'LL CALL MY SPIDER
CLARENCE CLARENCE THE SPIDER
SUPER SPIDER
A WEEK LATER VICTOR SAW CLARENCE GUARDING A CURIOUS ROUND OBJECT
HIDDEN BETWEEN SOME STONES VICTOR LOOK AT IT THROUGH HIS HANDS
THROUGH HIS HAND LENS
WHAT IS THIS HE WONDERED
VICTOR
SEARCHED THROUGH HIS SPIDER BOOK UNTIL HE FOUND A PICTURE OF SOMETHING THAT LOOKED
LIKE THE OBJECT CLARENCE WAS GUARDING
BY
COMPARING ITS SHAPE AND SIZE
TO THE PICTURE
VICTOR DISCOVERED THAT IT WAS AN EGG SAC
THE BOOK EXPLAINED THAT THE SAC FROM A
AFTER A FEMALE SPIDER MATES
MY SPIDER MUST
HAVE MATED WITH A MALE SPIDER BEFORE I FOUND HER THOUGHT VICTOR
I
HAVE TO SHOW THIS TO TOMMY AND TELL HIM MY SPIDER
IS NOT A CLARENCE IT'S A CLARA
WHEN VICTOR RETURNED WITH TOMMY HE SAW
CLARA
CLINGING THE EGG SAC
CLINGING EGG SAC THE BOYS WAITED AND
BUT CLARA DIDN'T MOVE TOMMY LOOKED CLOSER
OH NO VICTOR
I THINK SHE'S DEAD
THE BOYS WAITED BUT CLARA DIDN'T MOVE
TOMMY LOOKED CLOSER
OH NO VICTOR I THINK SHE'S
DEAD
THE BOOK SAID THE SPIDER WOULD BE DIE AFTER IT LAID
ITS EGG SAC
VICTOR SAID SADLY
BUT I HOPE
D
IT WOULDN'T HAPPEN TO CLARA
I GUESS
SINCE SHE'S DEAD WE SHOULD MAKE
SH WE SHOULD TAKE THE AQUARIUM BACK TO THE BARN
WINTER CAME AND
PASSED
ONE SPRING DAY
VICTOR WAS SEARCHING FOR
A WAITING
A WATERING CAN IN THE BARN
HE GLANCED SADLY TO CLARA'S CAGE THAT
HE AND TOMMY
HAD LEFT THERE LAST FALL
CLARA'S WEB
COVERED WITH
HUNDREDS OF TINY WHITE
BEADS
AND THE BEADS WERE MOVING
THE BEDS WERE MOVING
VICTOR RAN TO THE HOUSE GRABBED HIS
HAND LENS
AND RETURNED TO THE BARN
WHEN HE LOOKED
THROUGH THE HAND LENS HE SAW THAT THE
BEDS WERE
SHAPED LIKE SPIDERS
THE BABY SPIDERS HAVE HATCHED FROM THE EGG SAC
SAID VICTOR I'D BETTER TELL TOMMY
A WEEK PASSED VICTOR LEARNED FROM THE SPIDER BOOK THAT THE SPIDERS HAD GROWN BIG ENOUGH TO TAKE CARE OF THEMSELVES
HE ALSO KNEW THAT HE HAD TO DO
WHAT HE HAD TO DO
HE PICKED THE AQUARIUM AND CARRIED IT OUTSIDE
HE REMOVED THE SCREEN FROM THE TOP OF THE AQUARIUM SO THE SPIDERS COULD LEAVE
GOODBYE LITTLE SPIDERS HE SAID
IT'S TIME FOR YOU TO START
A NEW LIFE SOMEWHERE ELSE
WHEN VICTOR CAME HOME FROM SCHOOL THE NEXT DAY
HE RAN STRAIGHT TO THE BARN
THE LITTLE SPIDERS HAD GONE VICTOR SADLY WALKED BACK TO THE HOUSE
VICTOR YOU DID THE RIGHT THING
MRS GARCIA SAID
YOU MADE A
PROPER HOME FOR
CLARA AND TOOK VERY GOOD CARE OF HER
AND NOW YOU HAVE GIVEN HER CHILDREN A CHANCE TO MAKE HOMES THEIR OWN

HE FOUND SUE AND BILLY IN THE YARD THEY WERE DECIDING WHERE TO PUT THE ANIMALS WE CAN'T PUT SAM'S GOLDFISH
GOLDFISH NEXT TO ANN'S CAT SAID SUE YOU'RE RIGHT BILLY AGREED CATS LIKE TO EAT FISH
CATS AND FISH DO NOT BELONG NEXT TO EACH OTHER
YOU NEED A PLAN FOR YOUR ZOO SAID GRANDPA
BILLY THOUGHT ABOUT THE CITY ZOO DIFFERENT KINDS OF ANIMALS WERE DIFFERENT
WERE IN DIFFERENT AREAS WE NEED TO PUT THE ANIMALS IN GROUPS GRANDPA NODDED
HE PICKED UP THE SOME WOOD HE MADE
FIVE SIGNS ON EACH HE PAINTED ONE WORD WHEN HE WAS DONE HIS SIGNS SAID BIRDS MAMMALS FISH
AMPHIBIANS
REPTILES
SHOULD I PRESS NEXT
WINGS AND BEAKS THEY ALSO LAY EGGS SAID SUE MY PARAKEET
AND NANCY'S CHICKEN CAN GO IN THE SAME GROUP
THAT'S GOOD THINKING SAID GRANDPA
WHAT ABOUT ANIMAL MAMMALS BILLY ASKED A CAT IS A MAMMAL GRANDPA SAID SO MAMMALS HAVE HAIR OR FUR SAID SUE
AND THEY DON'T LAY EGGS THE BABIES GROW IN THE MOTHER'S MOTHER'S BODY BODY
SAID BILLY
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED WHEN OUR CAT HAD KITTENS
OUR CAT FED HER KITTEN MILK
FROM HER OWN BODY SAID SUE ADDED SUE
DOGS MUST BE MAMMALS TOO SAID BILLY AND HORSES AND LIONS AND HORSES AND LIONS
GRANDPA SMILED THAT'S RIGHT AND HER AND THERE ARE PEOPLES

MOST BABY FISH COME FROM EGGS BILLY ADDED OK SAID SUE BUT WHERE DO WE PUT JUAN'S FROG
THE FIRST
WHEN HE FIRST CAUGHT IT IT WAS A TADPOLE
THAT LIVED IN WATER
YEAH BILLY EXCLAIMED AND NOW IT CAN HOP
ON LAND OR SWIM IN A POND LIKE
THAT KIND OF ANIMAL IS AN AMPHIBIAN GRANDPA SAID
THE
BABIES HATCH FROM EGGS IN THE WATER LIKE FISH DO
WHEN THEY GET OLDER THEY CAN LI LIVE ON LAND

CALVIN DOESN'T HAVE A PET SAID BILLY HE IS GOING TO DRAW A PICTURE OF HIS FAVORITE ANIMAL THE WHALE
SHOULD IT GO WITH THE FISH GRANDPA SHOOK HIS HEAD A WHALE IS A STRANGE ANIMAL IT LIVES IN THE WATER LIKE FISH

NO
WHAT BILLY AT THE END OF THE DAY ALL ANIMALS GET TO GO HOME
SHOULD I PRESS END
WELL THEY WANT TO MAKE THEY WANT THEY WANT TO SEE A ZOO BUT THEY DON'T WANT TO GO ALL THE WAY TO THE CITY SO UHM AND MAKE THEIR OWN ZOO IN THE BACKYARD AND THEY WANT EVERYONE THEY KNOW TO BRING THEIR PET SO SO THEY WANT TO PUT THEM IN SPECIAL PLACES SO THEN THE ANIMALS WON'T GET EATEN OR ANYTHING
AND UHM AND THEY WANTED IT TO BE LIKE A REGULAR ZOO CAUSE MOST OF THEM ARE SEPARATED BY LIKE GROUPS AND UHM AND SO THE BEST PART ABOUT THIS STORY ABOUT THE END ABOUT THE ZOO WAS BECAUSE THEY GOT TO GO BACK HOME

WHEN
THE BROKEN ROCKS SHAKE
IT SENDS
OUT VIBRATIONS THAT MOVE THE EARTH
THESE VIBRATIONS

SHE SAID
RIGHT FRANCINE SAID
SOMETIMES THE EARTH ROLLS UP AND DOWN
IF AN EARTHQUAKE IS STRONG ENOUGH IT CAN
CAUSE
BUILDINGS TO FALL APART

EARTHQUAKE PROOF
HOW MARIA ASKED
FIRST YOU NEED TO
FIND A PLACE
TO BUILD ON
THAT'S SOLID LIKE
THAT
AREA BY THE
BARN
THERE'S PROBABLY
<unk> DEEP UNDER
THE DIRT THERE THERE'S PROBABLY
HARD ROCK
IT USUALLY STAYS
IN FIRM IN THE EARTHQUAKE
FRANCINE PICKED
UP A PENCIL AND QUICKLY MADE A
SKETCH
WHEN YOU BUILD
YOU SHOULD USE WOOD AND PUT A
BRACE
HERE
AND HERE

I HAVE AN IDEA MR RUIZ LOOKED OVER
FRANCINE'S SHOULDER
YOU CAN BUILD
THE CLUBHOUSE ON
THAT SQUARE OF CONCRETE
NEAR THE BARN

SURE ENOUGH A BIG ALLIGATOR WAS RESTING ON THE BANK OF THE CREEK
IT WAS BLACK BLACK AND TAN
ITS WET BUMPY HIDE SHONE SHONE IN THE SUN THEN IT CRAWLED BACK IN INTO THE MUDDY WATER
ONLY ITS HEAD STILL SHOWED

DEAL DIALED THE EMERGENCY NUMBER AND EXPLAINED
EXPLAINED THE ALLIGATOR TO THE ABOUT THE ALLIGATOR
CALL CALL DR BOB THOMAS SAID THE FIREMAN SAID THE FIREMAN SAID
HE'S AT THE LOUISIANA NATURE THE SCIENCE CENTER
DR THOMAS IS A SCIENTIST HE KNOWS ALL
ALL ABOUT
REPTILES
SOON DR THOMAS ARRIVED IN A IN A TRUCK THAT HAD WILDLIFE RESCUE PAINTED ON IT
THE TRUCK PULLED A TRAILER WITH A BOAT BRYAN AND JUDY ANN LOOKED UP LOOKED UP AT DONOR AT DR THOMAS
HE WAS VERY T TALL
HE SMILED THROUGH THE CURLY BROWN AND GRAY BE
BEARD
COME SE COME SEE THE ALLIGATOR JUDY ANN
CRIED
AN INVADED OUR OUR NEIGHBORHOOD SAID BRYAN
DR THOMAS LAUGHED ALLIGATORS LIVE HERE LONG BEFORE PEOPLE DID THAT
YOU MIGHT SAY WE IN
INVADED ITS NEIGHBORHOOD
DR THOMAS EXPLAINED
THAT WAS GOING TO CATCH THE ALLIGATOR AND TAKE IT TO A PLACE FAR AWAY FROM WHERE PEOPLE LIVE
HE TOOK A LONG POLE OUT OF HIS TRUCK
THE POLE HAD LOOPS
ON EACH END
TO
I USE THESE TO CATCH THE ALLIGATOR HE SAID THE HANDLE IS THE HANDLE IS SQUARE TO KEEP THE POLE FROM TWISTING WHILE I USE IT
WHY IS WHY IS ONE LOOP BIGGER THAN THE OTHER ASKED JUDY ANN
BECAUSE ALLIGATORS COME IN DIFFERENT SIZES
SIZES
ANSWERED DR THOMAS
ALLIGATORS CAN RUN FOR A SHORT DISTANCE BUT THEY CAN'T RUN FAST SO WHY DON'T YOU STAND
STAND A LITTLE FATHER AWAY IF YOU WANT TO WATCH CONTINUED DR THOMAS AS HE WALKED DOWN THE TOWARD THE ANIMAL
WHAT DO ALLIGATORS EAT BRYAN ASKED WELL DR THOMAS ANSWERED
GROWN ALLIGATORS MAY EAT JUST ABOUT ANYTHING
BUT USUALLY THEY EAT FISH FROGS TURTLES AND SNAKES
I I'LL
BET
IT'S WAITING FOR A LUNCH RIGHT NOW SAID BRYAN USUALLY DR THOMAS
EXPLAINED WHEN A ALLIGATOR WANTS TO EAT
IT WAITS QUIETLY IN THE WATER
UNTIL SOMETHING COMES BACK
THEN THE ALLIGATOR SNAPS IT
SNAPS UP
ITS MEAL AND TOSSES IT DOWN ITS THROAT
TO
CLOSE DOWN ON ITS PREY
BUT ONCE THE JAWS ARE SHUT
IT CAN EASILY HOLD THEM CLOSE
OTHERWISE IT WOULD BE T TOO DANGEROUS TO CATCH IT BY BY HAND
I WOULD USE
I WOULD HAVE TO USE A TRAP
DR THOMAS TOOK SOME SOME BIG BLACK RUBBER BANDS FROM HIS POCKET
SEE THOSE BANDS HE ASKED
DR THOMAS PULLED
PULLED ON A HIGH BLACK BOOTS
HE HE
EASED
EASED TO HIMSELF TO GENT
GENTLY

THE ALLIGATOR
THEN THE ANIMAL TURNED HIS DARK I
EYES TOWARD DR THOMAS
TOWARD DR THOMAS AND TRIED TO DIVE
AS IT STRUGGLED FIERCELY TO GET AWAY
THE LOOP CLOSED TIGHTLY AROUND ITS NECK
DR THOMAS PULLED THE ALLIGATOR TO THE SURFACE
AND DRAGGED IT T TO THE SHORE
THERE WAS ABLE
THERE HE WAS ABLE TO SIT ON THE ALLIGATOR
HE TIED UP
HIS FRONT FRONT AND BACK LEGS
NOW
HE QUICKLY PULLED
A BACK BLACK RUBBER BAND FROM ITS POCKET
FINALLY THE ALLIGATOR GREW TOO TIRED TO STRUGGLE
DR THOMAS HAD CAPTURED THE ALLIGATOR
NOW IT WAS TIME TO PUT THE ALLIGATOR IN THE BOAT AND BRING IT TO A NEW
HOME DEEP IN THE SWAMP
DR THOMAS WOULD FIND A PLACE WHERE WOULD BE FAR FROM PEOPLE
BRYAN AND JUDY ANN BRYAN AND JUDY ANN LOOKED AT THE ALLIGATOR
THEN THEY LOOKED AT EACH OTHER

HICKORY DICKORY DOCK THE MOUSE RAN UP THE CLOCK
THE CLOCK STRUCK ONE THE MOUSE RAN DOWN HICKORY DICKORY DOCK
INSIDE THE HOLLOW WALL OF THE HOUSE WAY UP NEAR THE ROOF
THERE LIVED A FAMILY OF MICE
WAIT
IT WAS A SNUG HOME

AND AS DARK AS ANY MOUSE COULD EVER WANT
MAMMA MOUSE LIKED IT
THE WIND THAT
CAME THROUGH THE ROOF MADE IT COOL AND
SUMMER WAIT

THERE WERE THREE CHILDREN
NAMED HICKORY

THERE
THERE HAD ONCE BEEN A PAPA MOUSE AS WELL BUT HE DIED
WHILE HE WAS HUNTING FOR FOOD ONE NIGHT HE SAW A NICE PIECE OF CHEESE IN A BOX AND TRIED TO GET IT WHEN
HE STUCK HIS HEAD INTO
BOX IT CLOSED WITH A SNAP
WAIT I NEED TO GET A TISSUE
WHEN MAMA MOUSE CAME DOWN
WHEN MAMA MOUSE CAME DOWN TO LOOK FOR HIM HE WAS DEAD
MAMA MOUSE WAS SAD TO BE ALL ALONE
SHE FELT THAT PEOPLE WERE MEAN TO KILL
A POOR MOUSE BECAUSE HE WANTED TO GET FOOD FOR HIMSELF AND HIS FAMILY
MICE CAN'T EARN MONEY LIKE PEOPLE DO SO THEY HAVE TO LIVE BY STEALING FOOD
MAMMA MOUSE WAS BRAVE
WAS A BRAVE MOUSE AND HE KNEW THAT IT WAS HER JOB TO FIND FOOD FOR HER CHILDREN
SO SHE DRIED HER EYES AND WENT TO WORK CHEWING THROUGH THE BOARD
BETWEEN THE KITCHEN AND THE WALL
IT TOOK TIME TO DO THIS BECAUSE SHE COULD ONLY WORK AT NIGHT
MICE LIKE TO SLEEP DURING THE DAY AND WORK AT NIGHT
AT NIGHT THERE ARE NO PEOPLE AROUND TO BUG THEM
AND
EVEN CATS SLEEP SOME MICE RUN
ABOUT IN THE DAY BUT THEY ARE NOT VERY SMART
AT LAST MAMMA MOUSE CHEWED THROUGH A HOLE IN THE BOARD BIG ENOUGH FOR HER TO GET THROUGH INTO THE KITCHEN
BUT SHE WAS SAD TO FIND THE BREAD COVERED WITH A PAN
HOW MEAN WAIT HOW MEAN PEOPLE ARE TO PUT THINGS WHERE A HUNGRY MOUSE CANNOT GET TO THEM SAID MAMMA MOUSE WITH A SIGH
BUT JUST THEN SHE SAW A BARREL
OF
FLOUR ON THE FLOOR
THAT MADE HER HAPPY
SHE KNEW SHE COULD EASILY CHEW THROUGH THAT
AND THEY COULD EAT THE FLOUR INSTEAD OF BREAD
IT WAS NOW ALMOST MORNING MAMMA MOUSE DECIDED T
TO LEAVE THE
ATTACK ON THE FLOOR FLOUR BARREL ON THE NEXT FOR THE NEXT NIGHT
SHE TOOK A FEW CRUMBS THAT WERE ON THE FLOOR FOR HER CHILDREN AND RAN
AND RAN BACK INTO THE WALL
UP TO HER NEST
HICKORY DICKORY AND DOCK WERE VERY GLAD TO GET THE CRUMBS BECAUSE THEY WERE HUNGRY
WOULD THEY
HAD EATEN THEY ALL CURLED UP WITH THEIR MOTHER
AND SLEPT ALL DAY
BE GOOD CHILDREN SAID MAMMA MOUSE THE NEXT NIGHT JUST GETTING READY FOR HER JOURNEY
TO THE KITCHEN DON'T COME OUT OF OUR NEST TILL I COME BACK
AFTER TONIGHT
WILL NOT BE HUNGRY FOR A LONG TIME
I WILL CHEW A HOLE IN THE BACK OF THE FLOUR BARREL
WHERE IT WILL NOT BE FOUND
SHE KISSED EACH ONE
GOOD BYE AND RAN DOWN THE WALL WHEN THEY WERE LEFT ALONE
HICKORY WANTED TO GO TO SLEEP AGAIN BUT LITTLE DOCK WAS WIDE AWAKE
HE JUMPED AROUND IN THE NEST SO MUCH THAT HIS BROTHERS COULD NOT SLEEP
I WISH I COULD GO WITH MOTHER
SOME NIGHT SAID DOCK IT'S DOCK IT'S NO FUN TO STAY HERE
ALL THE TIME SHE WILL TAKE US WHEN WE ARE BIG ENOUGH SAID DICKORY
WE ARE BIG ENOUGH NOW SAID DOCK AND IF I KNEW MY WAY I WOULD GO
OUT INTO THE WORLD AND SEE WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE
I KNEW
I KNOW A WAY OUT SAID HICKORY BUT MAMMA WOULDN'T LIKE IT IF
IT IF WE WENT OUT WITHOUT HER
SHE DOESN'T HAVE TO KNOW SAID
THE BAD DOCK
OH YES SAID HICKORY WELL SAID HICKORY I'D LIKE TO TAKE A STROLL MYSELF
BUT YOU MUST PROMISE TO BE CAREFUL AND NOT GET INTO TROUBLE
I'LL TAKE YOU THROUGH THE HOLE THAT I FOUND
SO THE THREE LITTLE MICE STARTED OFF
WITH HICKORY SHOWING THE WAY SOON THEY CAME TO A CRACK IN THE WALL
HICKORY STUCK HIS HEAD THROUGH
HE SAW THAT ALL WAS QUIET THE FAMILY OF PEOPLE
THAT LIVED IN THE HOUSE WAS FAST ASLEEP
SO
HE WENT
THROUGH THE CRACK AND HIS TWO BROTHERS CAME AFTER
THEIR LITTLE HEART BEAT
HEARTS
BEAT VERY FAST BECAUSE THEY KNEW IF THEY WERE FOUND THEY HAVE TO RUN FOR THEIR LIVES
THEY CREPT OVER THE THICK CARPET UNTIL THEY CAME TO SOME STAIRS
WHAT SHALL WE DO NOW SAID HICKORY ASKED HIS BROTHERS
LET'S GO DOWN S SAID DOCK SO THEY WENT DOWN THE STAIRS TO THE HALL
OF THE HOUSE VERY CAREFULLY
THEY WERE SURPRISED BY WHAT THEY SAW
THERE WAS A BIG WALL FOR HATS
AND COATS A BUCKET FOR UMBRELLAS TWO VERY PRETTY CHAIRS AND BEST OF ALL A TALL CLOCK THAT STOOD
ON THE FLOOR AND
TICKED OUT THE MINUTES LOUD AND STRONG VOICE
WHAT IS IT
SAID DICKORY VERY QUIETLY I DON'T KNOW SAID HICKORY HE WAS AFRAID T
AFRAID IT'S
IT S IS IT ALIVE ASKED DOCK
I DON'T KNOW SAID HICKORY AGAIN THEN THEY SAW THE CLOCK DIDN'T NOTICE THE
BUT KEPT TICKING AWAY SO THEY GOT
THEIR COURAGE UP AND RAN ABOUT SUDDENLY DICKORY GAVE
A YELL THAT MADE HIS BROTHERS COME RUNNING
THERE IN A CORNER LAY ALMOST HALF OF
THE LITTLE GIRL OF THE FAMILY HAD
IT WAS A GREAT FIND FOR THE THREE MICE
THEY ATE UNTIL THE LAST CRUMB WAS GONE
AND THEY WERE FAT AND HAPPY
THIS BETTER
THIS IS BETTER THAN THE KITCHEN SAID DOCK THEY HAD FINISHED THEIR SUPPER AND I BET
AND I BET THERE ARE PLENTY MORE GOOD THINGS AROUND IF WE LOOK FOR THEM
BUT THEY COULDN'T FIND MORE ALL THE DOORS IN THE HALL WERE CLOSED
DOCK WENT TO THE CLOCK
HE FOUND NOTHING EXCEPT A HOLE INSIDE OF
THE CLOCK
<unk>
DOCK COULD HEAR THE TICKING
LOUDER THAN EVEN NOW HE LOOKED HE LOOKED WAY UP ON THE TOP OF THE CLOCK AND SAW SOMETHING BRIGHT
HE THOUGHT IT MUST BE GOOD TO EVEN <unk> HE
IF YOU COULD ONLY GET TO IT WITHOUT SAYING ANYTHING TO HIS BROTHERS DOCK RAN UP
SIDE TO THE CLOCK
UNTIL HE CAME TO THE GEARS
HE WAS JUST BRIGHT

A SHINY WHEEL TO SEE WHAT

WHEN HE GOT TO THE HALL HE HEARD HIS BROTHER'S RUNNING UP THE STAIRS HE RAN AFTER THEM AS FAST AS HE COULD
ONLY WHEN THEY WERE SAFE
IN THEIR NEST AGAIN DID
THEY STOP TO BREATH THEY WERE SO SCARED THAT THEIR LITTLE HEARTBEAT
FAST FOR IT
THAT THEIR LITTLE HEARTS
BEAT
FAST FOR AN HOUR
MAMMA CAME BACK IN THE MORNING SHE BROUGHT SOME NICE FLOUR WITH HER FOR BREAKFAST SHE TOLD HER
THEY TOLD HER ABOUT THEIR ADVENTURE
SHE THOUGHT
THEY HAD BEEN PUNISHED ENOUGH ALREADY
FOR NOT LISTENING TO HER SO SHE DID NOT SCOLD THEM
SHE ONLY SAID YOU SEE MY DEARS
YOUR MOTHER KNEW BEST WHEN SHE TOLD YOU NOT LEAVE THE NEST
CHILDREN SOMETIMES THINK THAT
THAT THEIR PARENTS THAT
MORE THAN THEIR PARENTS THIS ADVENTURE
SHOULD TEACH YOU ALWAYS TO LISTEN TO YOUR MOTHER
THE NEXT TIME YOU RUN AWAY
IT MAY
END WORSE THAN LAST NIGHT
AFTER ALL REMEMBER WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR FATH
FATHER
BUT HICKORY AND DICKORY AND DOCK DID NOT RUN AWAY AGAIN

HER WILD STORIES WOULD GET HER INTO TROUBLE
THIS TIME HOWEVER CHRISTI
WAS SURE THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING VERY MYSTERIOUS GOING ON
SH
SPRING VACATION WAS ALWAYS
EXCITING BUT
THIS ONE WAS MORE EXCITING THAN USUAL
CHRISTI WAS ON AN AIRPLANE FOR THE VERY FIRST TIME
SHE WAS GOING TO
HOUSTON TEXAS
HOUSTON TEXAS TO VISIT HER
AUNT AND COUSINS
HER
PARENTS HAD BEEN
SO BUSY KISSING AND HUGGING
HER TO
HER GOOD BYE
THAT THEY HADN'T NOTICED THE
VERY MYSTERIOUS MAN WHO HAD
BOARDED THE PLANE AND WAS NOW SITTING RIGHT NEXT TO HER
CHRISTI
HAD NEVER MET ANYONE
IN LOS ANGELES T
WHO
WORE
WAIT
CHRISTI WAS SURE THAT HER IMAGINATION
THIS TIME
THERE WAS SOMETHING MYSTERIOUS ABOUT THE MAN FIRST OF ALL HE WAS WEARING TWO WATCHES
CHRISTI HAD NEVER MET ANYONE IN LOS ANGELES TO WORE TWO WATCHES AND HE COULDN'T THINK OF A GOOD REASON ANYONE WOULD
THEN THERE WAS A VERY
MYSTERIOUS BOX HE WAS CARRYING
ON THE
SIDE
IN THE BIG RED LETTERS IT SAID
N A C A
ALSO HE KEPT SCRIBBLING
THINGS
CHRISTI HAD TRIED WITHOUT SUCCESS TO SEE WHAT THE MAN WAS WRITING
AFTER LUNCH THE MAN PUSHED HIS SEAT BACK
AND TOOK A NAP
CHRISTI TOOK IT THE CHANGE TO GLANCE AT THE NOTE PAD IT READ
RETURN MOON BY TUESDAY
NOW CHRISTI WAS SURE THAT SHE WAS NOT SOMETHING STRANGE
RETURN TO THE MOON
N A S A
TWO WATCHES
CHRISTI HEARD THE PILOT SAY THAT THEY WERE ABOUT
TO LAND IN HOUSTON
SHE PUT HER THINGS IN TO HER BACKPACK THE PLANE LANDED
AND
WHEN THE MYSTERIOUS MAN LEFT HIS SEAT CHRISTI NOTICED THAT HE HAD DROPPED
A PHOTOGRAPH
SHE LOOKED AT IT
AND SAW THAT THE MAN HAD ALREADY LEFT
CHRISTI PUT THE PHOTOGRAPH IN HER POCKET
POCKET
AUNT GRACE WAS WAITING FOR CHRISTI
AT THE GATE
CHRISTI RAN AND HUGGED HER ON THE DRIVE HOME CHRISTI TOLD
AUNT GRACE ALL ABOUT
HER FLIGHT AND THE MYSTERIOUS MAN WHO SAT NEXT TO HER ON THE AIRPLANE
WHEN SHE REMEMBERED THE PHOTOGRAPH
AND TOOK IT OUT OF HER POCKET
THE PHOTOGRAPH SHOWED TWO SHINY GLOVES POKING THROUGH
TWO
ROUND HOLES AND A GLASS
CASE
THE GLOVE FINGERS
HELD TWEEZERS AND THAT WAS LIFTING
TIN DE TEENSY DARK STONE
MORE MYSTERIES THOUGHT CHRISTI AT LUNCH CHRISTI TOLD HER STORY TO THE COUSIN MARK AND SHOWED
HIM THE PHOTOGRAPH YOU CAN EXPLAIN THIS SHE SAID
WHAT DO YOU THINK RETURN THE TO THE MOON BY TUESDAY MEANS I DON'T KNOW MARK ANSWERED BUT THIS PHOTOGRAPH LOOKS VERY FAMILIAR
I KNOW
IT WAS IN A
BOOK
MY MIS SISTER HAS
YOU KNOW THAT TERRY IS TRAINING TO BE AN ASTRONAUT
I'M SURE I SAW IN ONE OF HER BOOKS
WELL
AUNT GRACE SAID TO MARK AND CHRISTI TERRY AT THE N A C S A
S
JOHNSON
SPACE CENTER
SHE WORKED NEAR THE
L
LUNAR EXAMPLE EXHIBIT
WE CAN VISIT HER THIS AFTERNOON
MAYBE SHE CAN HELP YOU FIND AN ANSWER TO THE MYSTERY
THEY FOUND TERRY RIGHT AWAY
FIRST SHE SHOWERED THEN A LARGE PHOTOGRAPH OF THE FIRST MAN ON MOON
NEARBY IN THE GLASS CASE THE FOOTPRINT PRESSED INTO THE LUNAR SOLE
BY AN ASTRONAUT BOOT
IT LOOKED LIKE THE PRINT OF BIG TENNIS SHOE
THE SOLE LOOKED LIKE THE DIRTY SAND ALL TOGETHER THERE WERE SIX
APOLLO MISSIONS OR TRIPS ON THE MOON BETWEEN NINETEEN SIXTY NINE AND NINETEEN SEVENTY TWO
FOR EACH MISSION THE SPACECRAFT CARRIED THREE ASTRONAUTS
ONCE THE MOON'S
ORBIT ASTRONAUT STAYED ON THE
COMMAND MODEL WHILE THE
OTHER TWO LANDED IN THE MOON
IN THE LUNAR MODEL
THOSE TWO ASTRONAUTS EXPLORED THE SURFACE AND COLLECTED MOON ROCKS
THAT IS SO SPECIAL ABOUT MOON ROCKS ASKED MARK
WELL TERRY FOR ONE OF THESE THINGS ROCKS ARE VERY OLD ABOUT THE SAME AGE
AS THE OLDEST ROCK ON EARTH
BY STUDYING THE MOON ROCKS
AND COMPARING THEM TO EARTH ROCKS SCIENTISTS LEARNED ABOUT
HOW THE MOON FORMED AND CHANGED
OVER BILLIONS OF YEARS
WHEN THEY EACH REACHED THE SECOND FLOOR CHRISTI AND
MARK WERE AMAZED
THEY WERE LOOKING AT GLASS CASES WITH TWO HOLES
IN EACH HOLE
WAS AN EMPTY BLACK RUBBER GLOVE
LIKE THE ONE IN THE PHOTOGRAPH A SIGN <unk> ON A WALL NEARBY
SCIENTISTS USE THESE CASES AND GLOVES TO THERE EXAMINE ROCKS TAKEN FROM THE MOON
THERE IS NO OXYGEN INSIDE THE CASE AND THE GLOVES ARE
WORN TO KEEP
THE SLICES OF MOON ROCK PURE
SO MUCH FOR YOUR MYSTERY SAID MARK
IT STILL IS A MYSTERY SAID CHRISTI IT
WAS TRUE THAT PARTS OF IT WERE CLEANED UP
THE MAN ON THE PLANE HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH THE
N A S A
AND PROBABLY WORKED
WITH MOON SAMPLES
BUT I STILL DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY ANYONE
WOULD WANT TO WEAR TWO WATCHES
OR
HOW
SOMEONE WOULD RETURN TO THE MOON
IT WAS TIME TO GO
AUNT GRACE TERRY MARK AND CHRISTI WERE IN THE PARKING LOT WHEN CHRISTI SAW A FAMILIAR FACE SIR SIR EXCUSE ME SIR

THIS IS IT DAD I'M GOING TO GROW SWEET CORN
BLUE RIBBON SWEET CORN
DAD SMILED
TO SEE CLINT SO EXCITED YOU'D BETTER READ THE DIRECTIONS DAD SAID GROWING
GOOD CORN TAKES A LOT OF WORK CLINT READ THE DIRECTION
ON THE DIRECTIONS ON THE SEED PACKET
PLANT SWEET CORN IN EARLY MAY
GET THE GROUND READY FOR PLANTING
PLANT THE SEEDS IN A SUNNY SPOT
PLANT SEEDS IN STRAIGHT ROWS
WATER THE SEEDS
ONCE A WEEK
OF IT
DOES NOT RAIN
THE CORN SHOULD BE FULLY GROWN IN EIGHTY FIVE DAYS
I THINK I CAN DO IT DAD SAID CLINT GOOD SIAD DAD
TODAY IS MAY F FIRST SO YOU BETTER START NOW
YOU CAN USE THE SMALL PLOT
YOUR MOTHER
GARDEN
BY YOUR MOTHER'S GARDEN TO PLANT YOUR CROP THAT AFTERNOON CLINT PLANTED THE CORN SEEDS IN FOUR NEAT ROWS
SPRING TURNED INTO SUMMER THE DAYS PAST QUICKLY
WHEN IT DIDN'T RAIN CLINT REMEMBERED TO WATER HIS CORN SOON THE GREEN SHOOTS WERE
GROWING TALL AND STRAIGHT SLOWLY
LONG LEAVES GREW OUT OF
THE STOCK
BY JULY PLANTS WERE AS TALL AS CLINT
ONE DAY DAD AND CLINT STOOD OUT BY CORN PLANT
IT'S TIME TO WATCH FOR
TOP
ON TOP OF THE CORNSTALK
CALLED
POL
OF CORN
THE WIND HELPS
CORN POLLEN
FALL OVER THE PLANT
CLINT LOOKED AT HIS CORN PLANT HOW DOES POLLEN HELP
THE PLANT STRINGS OF
CORN SILK <unk>
OUT OF EACH CORN HUSK
THESE STRINGS
CATCH THE POLLEN SAID DAD
THEY
TAKE IT
IN TO A THE
COB
WHERE THE KERNELS WILL GROW
THERE IS ONE STRING OF CORN
SKILL FOR EACH KERNEL
WHEN THE POLLEN REACHES THE COB
THE KERNELS BEGIN TO GROW
EVERY DAY CLINT CHECKED
HIS PLANTS FOR TASSELS HE WONDERED IF THE WIND WOULD BLOW ENOUGH
POLLEN FOR THE CORN SILK
ONE AFTERNOON CLINT FOUND
HIS DAD IN THE FIELDS DAD HE SAID
I'M WORRIED THAT NOT ENOUGH POLLEN WILL FALL ON THE CORN SILK
WELL SAID DAD SOMETIMES THE WIND DOESN'T BLOW ENOUGH
POLLEN
ONTO THE SILK
THEN THE FARMER HAS TO HELP
YOU WANT YOUR CORN TO BE ESPECIALLY GOOD
MAYBE YOU SHOULD THINK UP A WAY TO SPRINKLE THE POLLEN
ON THE SILK YOURSELF
CLINT TOOK
CLINT THOUGHT AND THOUGHT FINALLY HE LOOKED AT SOME OF HIS PARENTS FARMING
MAGAZINES
AN HOUR LATER CLINT RAN TO HIS CORN PLANT HE FOUND A WAY TO SPREAD THE POLLEN
FIRST
HE PULLED
NEXT HE HELD THE
BAG SHUT
AND
SHUT AT
THE BOTTOM CAREFULLY HE BENT
THE POLLEN WOULD NOT SPILL OUT OF THE BAG
THEN HE SHOOK THE PLANT THE POLLEN
SOON THE SILK AND HUSKS OF EACH PLANT WERE COVERED WITH POLLEN
IT WAS LONG HARD WORK BUT
CLINT WAS HAPPY
HE HAD SOLVED THE PROBLEM JUST LIKE A REAL FARMER OVER THE NEXT FEW WEEKS THE CORN GREW QUICKLY CLINT WORKED
IN HIS ROWS EVERY DAY
FINALLY HE MARKED OFF THE LAST OF THE EIGHTY FIVE DAYS
THAT MORNING HE PICKED
THREE EARS OF CORN THESE
EARS ARE THE BEST HE SAID
I'LL ENTER THE
THEM IN THE FAIR
WHEN THE FAIR WAS OVER CLINT CAME HOME AND TOOK OUT HIS SPECIAL BOX HE SMILED AND HE LAID A NEW BLUE RIBBON NEXT TO HIS
FATHER'S NOW THERE WERE TWO BLUE RIBBONS IN THE FAMILY
UHM HE WANT CLINT WANTED TO ENTER THE CONTEST SO
HE
ASKED HIS DAD WHAT HE SHOULD DO AND
HIS DAD
GAVE HIM AN IDEA OF PLANTING SOMETHING
AND
HE LOOKED IN THE PLANT THING
THE FEED
BASKET AND FOUND SWEET CORN AND HE PLANTED IT FIRST HE READ THE DIRECTIONS THEN HE PLANTED IT AND DID WHAT THE DIRECTIONS SAID AND HE
UHM ENTERED THE CONTEST AND WON ANOTHER BLUE RIBBON
THOSE COWS ARE TOO HARD TO CATCH SAID HUNGRY LION
THEY ARE NEVER A FAR APART AND WHEN I GET NEAR THEM THEY TURN THEIR TAILS TO ONE ANOTHER AND POINT THEIR LONG SHARP HORNS AT ME
THEY EVEN WALK DOWN TO THE RIVER TOGETHER WHEN THEY ARE THIRSTY
IF I COULD CATCH ONE OF THEM BY HIMSELF I COULD NOT
BE HUNGRY
BUT ONE OF THE
COWS HAD A FIGHT
THE BEST GRASS IS OVER IN THE VALLEY SAID ONE COW LET'S GO THERE
I DON'T LIKE THE GRASS THERE SAID ANOTHER
IT IS BETTER ON THE HILL
I WANT TO SPEND THE DAY THERE
I HATE CLIMBING THE HILL SAID THE THIRD COW

COME WITH ME AND
I WILL FIND YOU THE BEST GRASS YOU EVER HAD
I AM GOING TO THE VALLEY SAID THE FIRST COW
YOU THREE CAN DO WHAT YOU WANT
AND I WILL GO
TO THE HILL SAID THE SECOND COW
I THINK YOU ARE

CATCH YOU SAID THE THIRD COW
I AM NOT AFRAID OF THE LION SAID THE FOURTH COW
IF NONE OF YOU WILL GO WITH ME I'LL GO BY MYSELF TO EAT AT A BETTER
PASTURE PASTURE THAN ANY OF YOU
CAN FIND
I AM
OLDER THAN YOU
AND I KNOW WHERE THE BEST GRASS GROWS YOU HAD BETTER FOLLOW ME
WE WILL NOT S

K
SO THE FOUR COWS WENT DIFFERENT WAYS
ONE WENT TO THE VALLEY THE LION
WAS DOWN BY THE RIVER AND SAW HIM COMING HE WAITED QUIETLY UNTIL THE COW'S
COW WAS VERY
N NEAR AND JUMPED
THEN HE LOOKED AROUND FOR THE OTHER COWS
ONE WAS EATING G GRASS ON THE HILL THE COW SAW THE LION COMING
HIM COMING AND WAS SCARED HE COULDN'T GET AWAY AND
WITH ONLY ONE SET OF HORNS HE COULDN'T FIGHT THE LION GOT HIM TOO

STILL BE HUNGRY

SHE CAN HELP YOU
SAID
ELLEN
IF YOU WANT TO BE A BETTER RUNNER THERE
ARE THREE THINGS YOU SHOULD KNOW
SHE SAID FIRST YOU SHOULD RUN FOR FIFTEEN MINUTES EVERY DAY
HOW WILL THAT HELP
ASKED JUDE WHEN YOU RUN YOU USE A LOT OF MUSCLES IN YOUR BODY
EX EXCEPT COACH <unk> YOUR MUSCLES AREN'T USED TO RUNNING IF YOU RUN A LITTLE EVERY DAY
YOUR MUSCLES WILL GET STRONGER MUSCLES
THAT ARE EX
<unk> CAN WORK LONGER WITHOUT GETTING TIRED
OK SAID JUDE WHAT ELSE CAN I DO
IN THE RACE IN A RACE
YOU CAN ONLY
WAIT
WANT TO BE ABLE TO
RUN FA RUN AND NOT GET TIRED
YOU ALSO WANT TO RUN FAST
AND SAID COACH <unk>
SO THE SECOND THING YOU SHOULD DO
IS SOMETHING S SOME
<unk>
YOU SHOULD DO IT EVERY OTHER DAY
DO YOU KNOW WHAT SPREADING MEANS
JUDE THOUGHT FOR A MOMENT
HE HAD NEVER HEARD THE WORD
BEFORE I DON'T THINK SO
COACH HE SAID
PICK A SPOT THAT IS NOT TOO FOR FAR AWAY
RACE TO IT AS FAST AS YOU CAN
REST FOR A MINUTE THEN RACE BACK
TO WHY
YOUR
WHERE YOU STANDING
THAT'S WHAT SPRINTING MEANS DO YOU
THAT FOUR MINUTE
FOUR TIMES
S EXPLAINED COACH <unk>
AND DON'T FORGET TO WARM UP BEFORE YOU RUN
THAT IS THE THIRD IMPORTANT THING
YOU SHOULD KNOW
YOUR SISTER CAN SHOW YOU HOW
JUDE LOOKED AT
J
ELLEN
WHAT DOES WARM UP MEAN HE ASKED
WARMING UP MEANS DOING
EX
PRESSED
ELENA SAID
YOU SCRATCH YOUR
MUSCLES YOU STRETCH YOUR MUSCLES
MUSCLES THAT HAVEN'T BEEN S
GET HURT IT IS ALWAYS GOOD TO STRETCH BEFORE RUNNING OK BIG SISTER
SHOW SHOW ME WHAT TO DO SAID JUDE
FOR THE NEXT FOUR WEEKS JUDE WENT
TO THE PARK EVERY DAY TRYING
FOR THE RACE WAS NOT EASY SOMETIMES HE DIDN'T FEEL LIKE RUNNING
BUT HE MADE HIMSELF DO IT
ANYWAY HE PRACTICED JUST LIKE THE COACH
AND HIS SISTER HAD TOLD HIM
TO HE ALWAYS STRETCHED HIS MUSCLES BEFORE HE RAN
EVERY OTHER DAY JUDE W
WROTE
WORKED ON HIS SPEED

THE BOTTLE SOUNDS LIKE
A WHISTLE SAID
RAMON
THAT'S RIGHT SAID DAD

JEFF AND MIKE SQUEEZE SQUEEZED THEIR
HAND BRAKES SLOW DOWN
WHEN THEY REACHED THE FENCE JEFF DROPPED TO HIS KNEES
DROPPED TO HIS KNEES

LISA POINTED

ST
STEEL HI HILLS
WOW

SAID MIKE I CAN SEE WHY THEY CALL IT GREAT
BUT WHAT ABOUT GRAVITY
WELL GRAVITY IS A FORCE
A FORCE PUSHES
OR PULLS THINGS
EXPLAINED LISA
ON A ROLLER COASTER THE CARS ARE ATTACHED TO THE CHAIN
THAT WRAPS AROUND THE GEARS
WHEN THE
ENGINE TURNS THE GEARS THE CHAIN PULLS THE TOP OF THE CARS UP THE FIRST HILL
THE FIRST HILL IS ALWAYS THE HIGHEST ONE
WHEN THE CARS REACH THE TOP THE FORCE OF GRAVITY PULLS THEM THEM DOWN THE HILL
WHEN WHEN THEY REACH THE BOTTOM THE CARS ARE GOING FAST ENOUGH TO GET THE
NEXT HILL BY THEMSELVES
YEAH JEFF NODDED
GRAVITY IS WHY
WE COASTED SO FAST DOWN THE HILL ON OUR BIKES
THAT'S RIGHT
LISA REPLIED YOUR BICYCLE
AND THE ROLLER COASTER BOTH USE GRAVITY
BUT THERE IS ONE BIG DIFFERENCE YOUR B BIKES HAVE PEDALS
THE COASTER CARS HAVE NO PEDALS AND NO ENGINE
THE ROLLER COASTER IS MADE OF SEVERAL SIMPLE MACHINES
SIMPLE MACHINES HAVE ONLY TWO ONE OR TWO PARTS
ONE SIMPLE SIMPLE MACHINE
IS
AN
INCLINE
INCLINE
PLANE INCLINED
INCLINED
IS AN INCLINED PLANE
THAT'S JUST ANOTHER NAME FOR A RAMP
IS A RAMP A MACHINE ASKED MIKE

A MANSION
IS ANYTHING THAT HELPS
A MACHINE
IS
IS ANYTHING

SUPPOSE THAT YOU HAVE HAD TO CLIMB STRAIGHT UP
FROM THE GROUND TO THE TOP OF THE ROLLER COASTER HILL
THAT WOULD BE TOUGH SAID JEFF
A RAMP
THAN TO GO STRAIGHT
A RAMP THAN TO GO STRAIGHT UP
EXPLAINED LISA UP
THEN MIKE HAD AN IDEA
OUR BIKES GO UP THE HILL ARE THEY MACHINES
THE
YOUR BIKE IS MADE OF SEVERAL OF SEVERAL SIMPLE MACHINES
THE PEDALS HELP YOU TURN THE WHEELS THE PEDALS ARE PART OF A SIMPLE MACHINE CALLED
THE WHEEL
AND AXLE
AXLE
HUH THAT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE AT ALL OH WELL
THE HAND BRAKES ARE SIMPLE MACHINES CALLED LEVERS
HOW B HOW ABOUT THE GEARS

JEFF
JEFF CAUGHT THE PUPPY AND CLAPPED

I GUESS PUDDLE THINKS IT'S TIME TO GO HOME LAUGHED JEFF
PUDDLES PULLED AT HIS LEASH WHILE THE BOYS THANKED LISA
YOU'RE VERY WELCOME
SHE SAID COME BACK IN THE SUMMER
AND LET ME KNOW HOW
YOU LIKE THE ROLLER COASTER RIDE
AS THE BOYS TURNED TOWARD HOME MIKE THOUGHT ABOUT HIS HOMEWORK
I KNOW WHAT I'M GOING TO DO FOR A SCIENCE FAIR FOR THE SCIENCE FAIR HE ANNOUNCED I'M GOING TO FIGURE OUT HOW GEARS WORK ON MY BIKE
J JEFF SMILES
HE PLANNED TO BUILD A ROLLER COASTER FOR HIS CAR COLLECTION
HE'D CALL IT
THE LITTLE GRAVITY MACHINE
WELL
JEFF AND
UH JEFF AND
UH
I FORGET WHAT THE OTHER PERSON'S NAME WAS
JEFF AND
OH JEFF AND THE OTHER PERSON WHO HE WAS RIDING WITH THEY WERE RIDING ON THEIR BIKES
AND
I THINK IT WAS JEFF'S NEW PUPPY CAME RUNNING OUT
CAME RUNNING OUT AND HE ESCAPED
AND HE RAN DOWN TO THE

WELL
HE DUG UNDERNEATH THE FENCE
AND GOT INTO THIS LITTLE AREA
SO THE BOYS FOLLOWED

UHM
WELL THEY'RE TRYING TO FIND THE DOG AND THEN THIS LADY WELL SHE WAS PLAYING WITH THE DOG
AND SHE HEARD THE BOYS YELLING FOR THE DOG
SO SHE BROUGHT THE DOG TO THEM
AND ASKED IF THEY HAD LOST A DOG
AND THEY SAID YES SO SHE GAVE THE DOG TO THEM
AND IT WAS THEIRS AND THEN LIKE THEY THEY WERE
THEY GOT TO SEE HOW
UHM A ROLLER COASTER
AND THEY GOT TO LEARN HOW A ROLLER COASTER WAS MADE
AND ABOUT THE GRAVITY
AND
ABOUT
THE BIKES HAVE SOMETHING IN COMMON WITH WITH THE ROLLER COASTER

FOR
THE RACE IT WAS NOT EASY SOMETIMES HE DIDN'T FEEL LIKE RUNNING BUT HE MADE
HIMSELF DO IT COACH AND HIS SISTER HAD TOLD HIM TO AL HE ALWAYS
S
STRETCHED HIS MUSCLES BEFORE HE RAN
EVERY OTHER DAY JULIO WORKED ON HIS SPEED
HE COULD CHOOSE A TREE
NOT TOO FAR AWAY
AND
RACE TO IT HE WOULD REST BY COUNTING TO SIX
TEEN
THEN HE WOULD RUN BACK
TO WHERE HE STARTED THEN HE'D DO IT OVER AGAIN
EACH TIME HE
AH PRACTICED SPRINTING HE
HE THOUGHT OF WHAT IT WOULD BE LIKE WHEN HE BEAT
DEREK IN THE BIG RACE
AT FIRST JULIO FOUND FOUND IT HARD TO RUN HE WAS OUT OF BREATH
HE COULD FEEL HIS HEART
POUNDING HIS CH
IN HIS CHEST BUT AS THE DAYS PASSED HE RAN LONGER AND FASTER WITHOUT GETTING TIRED
HIS MUSCLES GOT STRONGER THE STRONGER HE GOT THE MORE HE COULD RUN HE USED

CASSIE TOOK OUT
CASSIE LOOKED AT THE POSTCARD IT HAD NO POSTMARK OR STAMP BECAUSE IT HAD COME IN A LETTER TO HER MOTHER
IT WAS FROM AUNT RED WING EVER SINCE AUNT RED WING HAD BEGUN TO TRAVEL SHE HAD PUT POSTCARDS FOR CASSIE IN MOTHER'S LETTERS AUNT RED WING WING TOOK PEOPLE ON TRIPS ALL OVER THE WORLD THE POSTCARDS SHE SENT CASSIE ALWAYS HAD A RIDDLE ABOUT WHERE SHE WAS THIS POSTCARD READ
CASSIE STUDIED THE RIDDLE I WONDER HOW THE LENGTH OF SHADOWS CAN TELL WHERE AUNT RED WING IS
I THINK IT I'LL ASK MATT CASSIE THOUGHT
PUBLIC LIBRARY CASSIE LIKED TO VISIT HIM THERE AS SHE WALKED TO THE LIBRARY CASSIE READ THE RIDDLE OVER AND OVER AGAIN
NOON SHADOWS ARE LONG THE SUN SETS SOON
WHERE IS IT COLD IN THE MONTH OF JUNE SHE HAD SOME IDEAS BUT THE
BUT
A
THE TWO IS IN THE WAY RIGHT HERE
TO ASK MATT A QUESTION
ALRIGHT NOW PRESS NEXT
HI SAID MATT WHEN CASSIE CAME
TO HIS DESK WHAT'S NEW HI SAID CASSIE LOOK WHAT I HAVE ANOTHER POSTCARD FROM AUNT RED WING MATT LAUGHED THAT MEANS YOU HAVE ANOTHER RIDDLE TO FIGURED OUT
YES I DO CASSIE SAID SHADOWS ARE THE FIRST CLUE TO THE RIDDLE CAN YOU TELL THE SEASONS BY THE LENGTH OF SHADOWS
YOU CERTAINLY CAN SAID MATT HE REACHED FOR THE LAMP ON HIS DESK LOOK ON THE FLOOR CASSIE WHAT DO YOU SEE WHEN I HOLD THE LAMP LIKE THIS CASSIE LOOKED TO THE FLOOR I SEE A SHORT SHADOW SHE SAID
BUT I DON'T SEE WHAT IT HAS TO DO WITH THE SEASONS LET'S PRETEND THAT THIS LAMP IS THE SUN SAID MATT WHEN THE LIGHT SHINES FROM ABOVE THE SHADOW IS SHORT DURING THE SUMMER THE NOON SUN IS HIGH IN THE SKY AND SHADOWS ARE SHORTER
BUT WHEN I HOLD THE LAMP AT THIS ANGLE THE SHADOW GROWS LONGER
THAT'S RIGHT SAID MATT
WHEN I HOLD THE LAMP AT AN ANGLE LIKE THE N NOON SUN
IS IN WINTER THE SHADOWS ARE LONG
AUNT RED WING IS IN A PLACE WHERE THE NOON SHADOWS ARE LONG SAID CASSIE
SINCE THE NOON NOON SUN IS LOW IN WINTER IT MUST BE WINTER WHERE AUNT RED WING IS CASSIE WAS PROUD OF HERSELF
THAT'S RIGHT SAID MATT
WHAT'S THE NEXT CLUE THE SECOND CLUE IS THAT THE SUNS SETS SOON CASSIE THOUGHT FOR A MOMENT
I KNOW THE SUN SETS MUCH EARLIER IN THE WINTER THAN IT DOES IN THE SUMMER
SO WHAT ALSO TELLS US IT'S WINTER WHERE AUNT RED WING IS
RIGHT AGAIN SAID MATT
BUT I HAVEN'T SOLVED THE RIDDLE YET SAID CASSIE SHE LOOKED AT THE GLOBE ON MATT'S DESK ISN'T ISN'T THIS THE EQUATOR SHE ASKED POINTING TO A LINE AROUND THE MIDDLE OF THE GLOBE THAT'S RIGHT SAID MATT
WELL SAID CASSIE PEOPLE WHO LIVE SOUTH OF THE EQUATOR HAVE WINTER STARTING IN JUNE AND SUMMER IN JANUARY DON'T THEY THAT'S TRUE SAID MATT
IF IT IS WINTER IN JUNE THEN AUNT RED WING MUST BE SOMEWHERE OUT SOUTH OF THE EQUATOR CASSIE THOUGHT
SHE LOOKED CAREFULLY AT THE GLOBE AUNT RED WING COULD BE IN SOUTH AMERICA OR AUSTRALIA OR MAYBE SHE'S SOMEWHERE IN AFRICA SAID CASSIE
MAYBE THERE'S ANOTHER CLUE SAID MATT
WHAT IS THE PICTURE ON THE CARD
IT'S SOME ANIMAL I DIDN'T
LOOK TOO CLOSELY CASSIE TURNED THE POSTCARD OVER
SHE LAUGHED A KOALA BEAR LOOK MATT IT'S A KOALA BEAR THEY LIVE ONLY IN AUSTRALIA DON'T THEY MATT NODDED WE WERE SO BUSY TRYING TO GUESS THE RIDDLE THAT WE NEVER EVEN LOOKED AT THE PICTURE
THAT'S RIGHT SAID CASSIE AUSTRALIA HAS
KOALA BEARS AND WINTER IN JUNE
AND LONG WINTER SHADOWS AT NOON SAID MATT AND AUNT RED WING AND HER RIDDLES RIDDLES LAUGHED CASSIE
OK
THEY WERE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHERE THEIR
UHM AUNT RED WING WAS
AND
SHE WROTE A RID RIDDLE ON THE POSTCARD AND THEY NEVER LOOKED AT THE PICTURE SO
THEY WERE TRYING TO GUESS
AND
MM
AND UHM
AT THE END THEY UHM WERE LOOKED AT THE UHM PICTURE
AND THEY SAW IT WAS A KOALA BEAR AND THEY
ONCE UPON A TIME A TORTOISE LIVED IN A POND WITH TWO DUCKS THEY WERE
THEY WERE HER VERY GOOD FRIENDS SHE LIKED DUCKS
SHE COULD TALK WITH THEM AS MUCH AS SHE LIKED
THE TORTOISE LIKED TO TALK SHE LIKED THE SOUND OF HER VOICE
THE TORTOISE AND THE DUCKS LIVED TOGETHER A LONG TIME THEN THE POND RAN OUT OF WATER THE DUCKS AND THE TORTOISE HAD NO WATER TO SWIM IN
THE T Q
THE TWO DUCKS COULD NOT LIVE WITHOUT WATER
THEY WERE GOING TO FLY AWAY TO MORE WATER
THEY WENT TO THE TORTOISE TO SAY GOODBYE
OH DON'T LEAVE ME SAID THE TORTOISE TAKE ME WITH YOU WILL DIE IF I STAY HERE
BUT HOW CAN WE
BUT
YOU CAN NOT FLY SAID THE DUCKS
HOW CAN WE TAKE YOU WITH US
TAKE ME WITH YOU WITH YOU TAKE ME WITH YOU SAID THE TORTOISE THE DUCKS FELT BAD
BUT THEY HAD
AN IDEA OF HOW TO TAKE HER
WE HAVE YOU
WE HAVE A WAY TO TAKE YOU THEY SAID
BUT YOU MUST NOT HAVE
NOT YOU MUST NOT MOVE WE WILL EACH TAKE ONE OF THE
ONE END OF A STICK
YOU WILL FALL
YOU WILL TAKE THE MIDDLE IN YOUR MOUTH THEN
WE WILL FLY UP IN THE AIR WITH YOU BUT DO NOT TALK IF YOU OPEN YOUR MOUTH
YOU WILL FALL
THE TORTOISE SAID SHE WOULD NOT SAY A WORD SHE WOULD NOT EVEN MOVE HER MOUTH
S SHE WAS VERY HAPPY SO THE DUCKS GOT A STRONG STICK
AND
HELD THE ENDS
THE TORTOISE BIT THE MIDDLE THEN THE TWO DUCKS FLEW AWAY WITH THEIR FRIEND
THEY WERE OVER THE TREES THE TORTOISE WANTED TO SAY HOW HIGH
WE ARE BUT SHE COULD NOT TALK
THE STICK WAS IN HER MOUTH
SO SHE KEPT STILL THEY SWAM SAW A PRETTY HOUSE SHE WANTED TO SAY WHAT IS THAT BUT SHE KEPT QUIET
THEY CAME
TO A TOWN
PEOPLE LOOKED UP AND SAW THEM LOOK AT THE DUCKS CARRYING A TORTOISE THEY SAID
EVERYONE RAN TO LOOK THE TORTOISE WANTED TO SAY BE QUIET SHE DID
DID NOT
BUT SHE DID NOT THAT IS FUNNY LOOK AT IT LOOK SHE SAID TORTOISE FORGOT THE STICK
SHE OPENED HER MOUTH TO SAY HUSH SHE FELL
TO THE GROUND SHE WAS
THAT WAS THE END OF THE TORTOISE
IT IS A VERY G
IT IS GOOD TO BE ABLE TO BE QUIET
THE
WATER
WENT AWAY IN THE POND THAT THEY LIVED IN
SO THEY HAD TO GO TO A DIFFERENT POND
BUT THE TORTIOSE COULDN'T COME
SO THEY NEEDED TO PUT A UHM
ST THEY HAD TO CARRY A STICK AND THE TORTOISE HAD TO BITE THE STICK
UHM SO THEY COULD GO
BUT THEN UHM THE PEOPLE WANTED TO
THEN THE PEOPLE WERE KIND OF LAUGHING AT THE TORTOISE AND THE TORTOISE UHM
REALLY WANTED TO SAY HUSH TO THE UHM PEOPLE BUT SHE DIDN'T UNTIL SHE FORGOT ABOUT THE STICK

AND SHE FELL AND
THAT WAS THE END OF HER

JUSTIN AND HIS HAT
ONE DAY JUSTIN AND HIS MOTHER WENT SHOPPING FOR HATS AND FOUND THE PERFECT ONE
BUT JUSTIN WOULD NEVER WEAR THE HAT AND THAT MADE HIS MOM ROLL HER EYES
IT WASN'T THAT HE DIDN'T LIKE THE HAT IN FACT HE LOVED IT
HE THOUGHT IT WAS GREAT
IT TOTALLY FIT HIS HEAD HE LOVED THE WAY IT WAS A LITTLE TIGHT AT FIRST BUT THEN STRETCHED TO THE PERFECT SIZE
HE LOVED THE COLOR THE SIZE THE SHAPE AND THE NEW HAT SMELL
HE EVEN LIKED THE WAY HIS HAIR LOOKED WHEN HE TOOK THE HAT OFF
UNFORTUNATELY JUSTIN WAS TOO SMART FOR HIS OWN GOOD
HE FIGURED OUT THAT THE HAT WOULD GET DIRTY OR LOST IF HE WORE IT TOO MUCH SO HE MADE A PROMISE TO HIMSELF THAT HE WOULD NEVER WEAR IT EXCEPT ON SPECIAL DAYS
HE WANTED THE HAT TO BE CLEAN AND PERFECT FOREVER
IF IT GETS DIRTY I'LL WASH IT SILLY SAID HIS MOTHER
BUT IT'LL SHRINK IF YOU WASH IT AND THEN IT'LL BE TOO SMALL HE SAID
SIL
HIS FATHER SAID YOU SHOULD REALLY WEAR THE HAT IF YOU LIKE IT OR ELSE YOU WILL BE SORRY
BUT JUSTIN DIDN'T LISTEN AND EVERYDAY THE HAT SAT IN A CLEAR PLASTIC BOX SO IT WOULDN'T GET DIRTY
SOMETIMES JUSTIN WOULD IMAGINE HIMSELF WALKING AROUND SCHOOL WITH THE HAT ON HIS HEAD
ONCE HE EVEN IMAGINED HIMSELF AS A GROWN UP WEARING THE HAT AND SPEAKING
SIL
IN FRONT OF MANY PEOPLE
HE IMAGINED THE PEOPLE WHISPERING TO THEMSELVES WHAT A FINE SPEAKER HE IS AND SUCH A HANDSOME HAT TOO
ON HIS NEXT BIRTHDAY HE DECIDED TO WEAR THE HAT
THERE WERE MANY PRESENTS BUT THE ONLY THING THAT MADE JUSTIN WAS
SIL
EXCITED WAS GETTING TO WEAR HIS HAT
HE WENT TO HIS ROOM OPENED THE PLASTIC BOX AND TOOK THE HAT OUT VERY CAREFULLY
THEN SLOWLY SLID IT ON
IT WAS A LITTLE TIGHT AT FIRST LIKE IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE
IT WAS JUST LIKE HE REMEMBERED
HE WAS SO HAPPY THAT HE COULDN'T HELP BUT SMILE
I KNOW IT'S JUST A HAT HE THOUGHT TO HIMSELF BUT I SURE DO LOVE IT
SIL
BUT THEN HE NOTICED THAT IT WASN'T STRETCHING
SIL
SOMETHING WAS WRONG IT WAS A LITTLE TIGHT
JUSTIN COULD TELL IT WASN'T PERFECT ANYMORE
HE KNEW CRYING WOULDN'T HELP MAKE THE HAT PERFECT AGAIN BUT HE CRIED ANYWAY
HE TOLD HIS PARENTS I DON'T WANT ANY OF THOSE GIFTS I WANT TO RETURN THEM ALL AND TRY
SIL
TO FIND A NEW PERFECT HAT INSTEAD
HIS PARENTS LOOKED AT EACH OTHER AND KNEW THAT JUSTIN HAD LEARNED A GOOD LESSON
SON WE

RACER THE DOG
WHEN HIS OWNERS GOT HIM AS A PUPPY HE ALL WANTED ALL HE WANTED TO DO WAS RUN AND RUN SO HIS OWNERS NAMED HIM RACER
THEN WHEN HE GOT OLDER HE DEVELOPED PROBLEMS WITH HIS BACK LEGS
EVERY TIME HE RAN HE WOULD LIMP BUT THAT DIDN'T STOP HIM FROM RUNNING BECAUSE LIKE MOST DOGS RACER LOVED TO RUN
THERE WAS A DOG PARK NEAR WHERE HE LIVED
HE ENJOYED PLAYING AT THE DOG PARK BECAUSE HE DIDN'T HAVE TO BE ON HIS LEASH WHEN HE WAS THERE SO HE COULD RUN AS MUCH AS HE LIKED
SIL
THERE WAS ONE DOG AT THE DOG PARK NAMED FRANG FANG
<br> HE WOULD ALWAYS COME UP TO RACER AND BITE HIS BACK LEGS AND RUN AWAY SAYING BARK BARK BARK BARK
WHICH IN DOG TALK MEANS YOU ARE TOO SLOW TO CATCH ME WITH THAT LIMP LEG OF YOURS SO I'M GOING TO PICK ON YOU
RACER WOULD ALWAYS CHASE FANG BUT HE WOULD NEVER CATCH HIM
SIL
ONE DAY RACER WENT TO THE VET
RACER LIKED THE VET BECAUSE THE PEOPLE IN THE WHITE COATS GAVE HIM TREATS
RACER DIDN'T KNOW IT BUT HE WAS AT THE VET
SIL
TO HAVE SURGERY TO FIX HIS LEGS
WHEN HE WOKE UP FROM THE SURGERY HE DIDN'T H EVEN REMEMBER WHERE HE WAS AND SOON HIS OWNERS CAME AND DROVE HIM HOME
SIL
ON THE DRIVE HOME RACER REALIZED THAT HIS LEGS ITCHED VERY BADLY HE THOUGHT OH BOY I'M GOING TO LICK MY LEG SO HARD THAT THE ITCHING IS GOING TO GO AWAY
SO HE TURNED HIS HEAD AROUND TO LICK HIS LEG BUT THERE WAS A BIG WHITE THING IN ITS WAY IN HIS WAY
SIL
HE WAS WEARING A COLLAR THAT MADE IT IMPOSSIBLE TO LICK HIS LEGS
A FEW DAYS LATER HE WENT WITH HIS OWNERS TO THE DOG PARK
RACER HAD TO BE ON A LEASH SINCE HE STILL NEEDED TO HEAL FROM HIS SURGERY
BUT IT WAS NICE TO SEE ALL HIS FRIENDS
MEAN OLD FANG SAID BARK BARK BARK BARK WHICH MEANT
WHY DO YOU HAVE TO WEAR THAT STUPID LOOKING COLLAR IT SURE DOES LOOK SILLY
EVENTUALLY RACER DIDN'T HAVE TO WEAR THE COLLAR BUT BY THEN HIS LEGS DIDN'T ITCH SO HE DIDN'T WANT TO LICK THEM
<br> FOR SIX WEEKS RACER WOULD TAKE WALKS AND GO TO THE DOG PARK BUT STILL HE WOULD H HAD TO BE ON HIS LEASH LEASH
ONE DAY HE TOOK A WALK TO THE DOG PARK AND ALL HIS FRIENDS WERE THERE AS USUAL
THEN HIS OWNERS REACHED AROUND HIS NECK AND TOOK OFF HIS LEASH TH JUST THEN FRANK BIT HIM ON THE BACK L LEG AND RAN AWAY
RACER'S OWNERS SAID GO RUN SO RACER STARTED RUNNING AND CHASING FANG
FANG WAS LAUGHING BECAUSE HE KNEW RACER COULD NEVER CATCH HIM BUT SUDDENLY HE NOTICED THAT RACER RACER WAS CATCHING UP WITH HIM
RACER WAS RUNNING FASTER THAN HE COULD EVER REMEMBER AND BEFORE HE KNEW THAT HE HAD CAUGHT UP TO FRANK AND KNOCKED HIM DOWN BEFORE HE KNEW IT
SIL
RACER SAID BARK BARK WHICH IN DOG TALKS MEANS DON'T PICK ON ME ANY MORE FANG
AND FROM THAT DAY ON FANG NEVER BIT RACER'S LEGS
RACER WAS SO HAPPY THAT HE COULD RUN FAST THAT HE RAN AND RAN IN CIRCLES
FINALLY HE RAN BACK TO HIS OWNERS AND GAVE THEM A BIG KISSES FOR FIXING HIS LEGS

SIL
DEAR MOM AND DAD
SINCE YOU HAVE GROUNDED ME AND TOLD ME TO WRITE DOWN WHY I AM <unk> SORRY BEFORE I WAS ALLOWED OUT OF MY ROOM I AM MAD AT YOU
I WOULD LIKE TO START BY SAYING THAT I THINK THAT YOU ARE VERY MEAN
SIL
<unk> TO MAKE ME DO THIS BECAUSE I WA IT WASN'T EVEN MY FAULT
I COULDN'T HELP IT ANYWAYS IT WAS AN ACCIDENT AND I DIDN'T EVEN DO IT ON PURPOSE
I REALLY DIDN'T MEAN TO SH SHAVE THE CAT REALLY I SWEAR I SWEAR
OK
<br>
HERES WHAT HAPPENED AS I REMEMBER IT
I SAW THAT THE CAT WAS TRYING T TO GET THE GERBILS AND YOU TOLD US WE COULDN'T HIT ANIMALS SO WHAT <unk> SO I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT ELSE TO DO
SO I GRABBED DAD'S NOSE HAIR CLIPPERS AND SHAVED IT
I SHOULD HAVE
SIL
YOU SHOULD BE PROUD OF ME
SIL
FOR THINKING SO FAST ON MY TOES
SIL
<unk> OH SURE IT'S EASY TO SAY THAT I SHOULD HAVE JUST PICKED UP THE CAT BUT THOSE STUPID GERBILS DIDN'T EVEN THANK ME
THEY JUST RAN ON THAT STUPID WHEEL
SIL
AND DID STUPID THINGS THAT'S THE LAST TIME I SHAVE THE CAT TO PROTECT ANY STUPID GERBILS
BESIDES THE REAL REASON I SHAVED THE CAT WAS TO KEEP IT NICE AND COOL
I JUST DIDN'T WANT TO SEE THE CAT GETTING ALL HOT AND UNCOMFORTABLE AND STUFF
YOU GUYS WILL JUST PROBABLY SAY IT'S WINTER DANNY CATS DON'T OVERHEAT IN WINTER
BUT SO WHAT IF IT'S WINTER I MEAN IT'LL BE SUMMER SOON ENOUGH AND I JUST WANTED THE CAT TO GET USED TO THE IDEA BEFORE IT GOT REALLY HOT
PLUS <unk> OSCAR MY TURTLE TOLD ME TO SHAVE THE CAT
<unk> FINE OSCAR CAN'T REALLY TALK BUT IF HE COULD HE WOULD HAVE SAID PLEASE SHAVE THE CAT
IF IT KEEPS HITTING ME ON THE SHELL AND TRYING TO ROLL ME OVER WHEN I LEAVE THE ROOM YOU GUYS YOU GUYS NEVER LIKED OSCAR AS MUCH AS THE CAT ANYWAY
YOU WOULDN'T ALWAYS TAKE THE CAT'S SIDE IF YOU KNEW THE STUFF HE DID TO MY POOR TURTLE
CATS AREN'T AREN'T ALWAYS NICE JUST LIKE MY SISTER JENNY ISN'T ALWAYS NICE
SIL
BUT THE REALEST REASON I SHAVED MY SHAVED THE CAT WAS TO MAKE A WIG FOR
<unk>
THOSE POOR HAIR LESS CATS THAT WE SAW ON TV ON THE ANIMAL CHANNEL
I KNEW OUR CAT WOULD GROW HER FUR BACK BUT SOME CATS DON'T HAVE HAIR
<unk> THEY ARE CALL CALLED HAIRLESS CATS
THEY NEED F FUR IN THE WINTER BECAUSE I TH THINK I SWEAR THAT'S THE REASON
ALSO I WAS GOING TO SELL THE CAT FUR TO BUY MY SISTER'S JENNY BRACES FOR HER BIG STUPID FACE
<br> PLUS I FORGOT TO TELL YOU THAT YOU SHOULD BE BLAMING MS CASPER MY SCIENCE TEACHER
SHE MADE US SHAVE SOME SOMETHING FOR SCIENCE ASK HER
SHE SAID THAT WHEN WE SHAVE A CAT A LOT OF A BUNCH OF TIMES HER HAIR WOULD GROW BACK HARDER EACH TIME AND SOON
SIL
YOU COULD TAKE HER ON TV SHOWS AND GET LOTS OF MONEY SO THAT YOU CAN SEND JENNY TO COLLEGE EVEN IF SHE IS DUMB LI IS A DUMB LITTLE TATTLE TALE
SHE'S SO GOOD AT SCHOOL AND YOU BOUGHT HER A CAT CAUSE SHE'S SO RESPONSIBLE AND STUFF
JUST CAUSE SHE'S A GOOD STUDENT DIDN'T MEAN SHE'S DOESN'T
SIL
DIDN'T MEAN SHE'S REALLY RESPONSIBLE
LAST NIGHT I SAW THAT SHE DIDN'T BRUSH HER TEETH OH YEAH I FORGOT TO TELL YOU YOU THAT
DEAR MOM AND DAD JENNY DIDN'T BRUSH HER TEETH LAST NIGHT
<unk> I THINK SH SHE SHOULD BRUSH H T BRUSH HER TEETH TWICE TONIGHT THATS JUST MY OPINION THOUGH
I BET YOU DIDN'T KNOW SOMETHING ELSE DID YOU KNOW I WANTED TO BE A BARBER
I WAS AFRAID TO TELL YOU THE R REALLY RE THE REALLY REASON I SHAVED THE CAT WAS THAT I WANT TO BE A BARBER I NEED PRACTICE
<br> I WAS AFRAID YOU WOULDN'T LET ME PRACTICE ON MY OWN HEAD CAN I CAN PRACTICE BY SHAVING JENNY'S HEAD
I PROMISE I'LL DO A BETTER JOB THEN I DID ON THE CAT CAUSE NOW I HAVE WHAT DAD CALLS LIFE EXPERIENCE
NOT THAT I SHAVED THE CAT THOUGH
<unk> ACTUALLY THE TRUTH IS THAT I I BY ACCIDENT TURNED ON THE NOSE HAIR CLIPPER
AND THE CAT WAS BEING CHASED BY THE TURTLE THAT RAN RIGHT BY THE CLIPPERS AND SHAVED HERSELF
I KEPT SAYING NO KITTY NO DON'T SHAVE YOURSELF
BUT MY STUPID SISTER NEVER TAUGHT HER CAT HOW TO LISTEN SO SHE JUST IGNORED ME
SHE SHE'S NOT SO RESPONSIBLE AFTER ALL
IF SHE <unk> IF I HAD A CAT I WOULD TEACH HER HOW TO NOT I WOULD TO NOT SHAVE ITSELF THAT'S FOR SURE
I DON'T HAVE A GOOD GET I DON'T HAVE TO GET GOOD GRADES TO KNOW <unk> THAT YOU SHOULD TEACH A CAT TO SHAVE ITSELF
SIL
<unk> PLUS IF IT WEREN'T ANYWAYS CUDDLING WITH MY SISTER SO MUCH MAYBE <unk> MAYBE SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN ENOUGH
SIL
THE CAT LIKED BEING SHAVED ANYWAY SO IT DIDN'T IT DO I DON'T SEE THE BIG
SIL
I DON'T SEE THE BIG DEAL
I THINK
SIL
I THINK IT REALLY LIKED IT'S HAIRCUT
THE ONLY REASON IT HASN'T <unk> COME OUT FOR TWO WEEKS IS BECAUSE YOU GUYS MADE SUCH A BIG DEAL ABOUT IT
POOR KITTY THIS AND POOR KITTY THAT
IT'S YOUR FAULT REALLY DAD PLEASE DON'T READ THE NEXT PART
<br> DEAR MOM WANT DAD KNOW THAT THE REAL REASON I SHAVED THE CAT WAS THAT HE'S REALLY SNEEZE SNEEZING AROUND
I KNOW HOW MUCH YOU HATE HIM ANY ALWAYS SNEEZING AND STUFF
SO I THOUGHT I'D GET RID OF HIS FUR HE WOULDN'T SNEEZE AND THAT YOU WOULD HAVE A BETTER MARRIAGE
SO IT WAS REALLY MY FATHER'S DAY GIFT TO HIM
I COULDN'T BUY HIM ANYTHING NICE SINCE IT TOOK AWAY MY ALLOWANCE FOR WHEN I SHAVED THE NEIGHBOR'S DOG
SIL
<unk> HOW COME JENNY GETS A CAT AND I GET A STUPID TURTLE ANYWAY
TURTLES DON'T DO ANYTHING EXCEPT POKE THEIR HEADS OUT AND BE NOT CUDDLY
SIL
CAN I GET A DOG
SIL
GET A DOG PLEASE
SO IN CONCLUSION I'M GETTING HUNGRY AND SORRY FOR SHAVING THE CAT
PS IF YOU WOULD HAVE BROUGHT HER A A TURTLE I COULD'VE SHAVED IT
SIL
SHAVED IT
SINCERELY DANNY
WELL IT'S IT'S ABOUT A KID WHO SHAVES HIS SISTER'S CAT SO HE GETS GROUNDED AND SENT TO HIS ROOM
AND HE'S WRITING A LETTER TO HIS MOM AND DAD <br> TO TELL THEM IT WAS AN ACCIDENT
AND HE HAS LIKE ALL THESE DIFFERENT REASONS THAT <br> HE WHY HE DID IT AND
SIL
<br> AND HE WA AND HE IN THE END HE'S ASKING THEM FOR A DOG
SIL
AND SO THAT'S
SIL
<br> A SH MM
SIL
AND <br> H IN ONE PART HE HE WRITES HIS MOM AND DAD ABOUT UH UHM THAT SAYS HIS BIG HIS BIG OR LITTLE SISTER I DON'T KNOW WHICH ONE <br> DIDN'T BRUSH HER TEETH
THE LAST NIGHT SO UHM HE THINKS SHE SHOULD BRUSH HER TEETH TWICE THAT NIGHT <br> UHM
SIL
UHM AND THAT'S REALLY ALL
SIL
ONE WAS HIS TURTLE WAS CHASING THE CAT AND HE K AND HE TURNED ON THE NOSE RAZOR WHICH <br> AND THE CAT KEPT RUNNING BY AND SHAVING ITSELF THAT WAS ONE OF IT'S EXC <br> HIS EXCUSES
SIL
AND THE SECOND ONE WAS THAT THEY WERE TRYING TO GET H HE WAS THEY WERE TRYING TO GET THE GERBIL HE WAS TRYING TO GET THE GERBIL <br> ANOTHER ONE UM WAS THAT IT WAS GONNA IT WAS A FATHER'S DAY PRESENT TO HIS DAD BECAUSE THE CAT WAS ALWAYS SNEEZING SO HE THOUGHT HE'D SHAVE OFF OFF ALL THE FUR

JUSTIN AND HIS HAT
ONE DAY JUSTIN AND HIS MOTHER WENT SHOPPING FOR HATS AND FOUND THE PERFECT ONE BUT JUSTIN WOULD NEVER WEAR THE HAT AND MADE HIS MOTHER ROLL HER EYES
SIL
IT WASN'T THAT HE DIDN'T LIKE THE HAT IN FACT HE LOVED IT HE THOUGHT IT WAS GREAT
IT TOTALLY FIT HIS HEAD HE LOVED THE WAY IT WAS A LITTLE TIGHT AT FIRST BUT THEN STRETCHED TO THE PERFECT SIZE
<unk> HE LOVED THE COLOR AND SIZE AND SHAPE THE SHAPE AND
SIL
THE NEW
SIL
HAT SMELL HE EVEN LIKED THE WAY HIS HAIR LOOKED WHEN HE TOOK THE HAT OFF
UNFORTUNATELY JUSTIN WAS TOO SMART FOR HIS OWN GOOD
HE FIGURED OUT THAT THE HAT WOULD GET DIRTY OR LOST IF HE WORE IT TOO MUCH
SIL
SO HE MADE A PROMISE TO HIMSELF THAT HE WOULD NEVER WEAR IT EXCEPT ON SPECIAL DAYS
HE WANTED THE HAT TO BE CLEAN AND PERFECT FOREVER
IF IT GETS DIRTY I'LL WASH IT SILLY SAID HIS MOTHER
BUT IT'LL SHRINK IF YOU WASH IT AND THEN IT'LL BE TOO SMALL HE SAID
HIS FATHER SAID YOU SHOULD REALLY WEAR THE HAT IF YOU LIKE IT OR ELSE YOU'LL BE SORRY
BUT JUSTIN DIDN'T LISTEN AND EVERYDAY THE HAT STAYED IN A CLEAR PLASTIC BOX SO THAT IT WOULDN'T GET DIRTY
SOMETIMES JUSTIN WOULD IMAGINE HIMSELF WALKING AROUND SCHOOL WITH THE HAT ON HIS HEAD
ONCE <unk> HE EVEN IMAGINED HIMSELF AS A GROWN UP WEARING THE HAT AND SPEAKING IN FRONT OF MANY PEOPLE
HE IMAGINED THE PEOPLE WHISPERING TO THEMSELVES WHAT A FINE SPEAKER HE SAID HE IS
SIL
AND SUCH A HANDSOME HAT TOO
SIL
ON HIS NEXT BIRTHDAY HE DECIDED TO WEAR THE HAT
SIL
THERE WERE MANY PRESENTS BUT THE ONLY THING THAT MADE JUSTIN EXCITED WAS GETTING TO WEAR HIS HAT
HE WENT TO HIS ROOM OPENED THE PLASTIC BOX AND TOOK THE HAT OUT VERY CAREFULLY THEN HE SLOWLY SLID IT ON
SIL
IT WAS A LITTLE TIGHT AT FIRST
SIL
LIKE IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE IT WAS JUST LIKE HE REMEMBERED HE WAS SO HAPPY THAT HE COULDN'T HELP BUT SMILE
I KNOW IT'S JUST A HAT HE THOUGHT TO HIMSELF BUT I SURE DO LOVE IT BUT THEN HE NOTICED THAT IT WASN'T STRETCHING
SOMETHING WAS WRONG IT WAS A LITTLE TIGHT JUSTIN COULD TELL IT WASN'T PERFECT ANYMORE
SIL
HE KNEW CRYING WOULDN'T MAKE THE HAT PERFECT AGAIN BUT HE CRIED AWAY
HE TOLD HIS PARENTS I DON'T WANT ANY OF THOSE GIFTS I WANT TO RETURN THEM ALL AND TRY TO FIND A NEW PERFECT HAT INSTEAD
HIS PARENTS LOOKED AT EACH OTHER <unk> AND KNEW THAT JUSTIN HAD LEARNED A GOOD LESSON
SON WE WOULD BE HAPPY TO BUY YOU A NEW HAT BUT ONLY IF YOU PROMISE TO WEAR IT THE FATHER SAID
JUSTIN REPLIED <unk> I PROMISE THAT IF <unk> WE FIND THE PERFECT HAT I'LL WEAR IT EVERYDAY
SO THE NEXT DAY JUSTIN AND HIS MOTHER WENT SHOPPING FOR HATS AND FOUND THE PERFECT ONE
<unk> FROM THEN ON JUSTIN WOULD NEVER TAKE IT OFF AND THAT MADE HIS MOM ROLL HER EYES
SIL
I THINK THIS STORY IS ABOUT A KID NAMED JUSTIN AND HE HAS THIS HAT THAT
SIL
HE WOULD NEVER WEAR EXCEPT FOR ON SPECIAL OCCASIONS AND DAYS AND STUFF
SO
SIL
ON HIS BIRTHDAY
SIL
HE WORE THE HAT AND IT WAS A LITTLE TIGHT AT FIRST BUT THEN AFTER A LITTLE WHILE HE FOUND OUT THAT THE HAT WAS TOO SMALL
SIL
AND HE WENT DOWN TO HIS PARENTS AND TOLD HIM THAT THE HAT WAS TOO SMALL
SIL
AND
SIL
THEN
SIL
UHM
SIL
H HE WANTED TO RETURNED THE PRESENTS THAT HIS FRIENDS GOT HIM AND
SIL
UHM GET A NEW PREFECT HAT
SIL
SO THE DAY AFTER HIS BIRTHDAY HIM AND HIS MOM WENT SHOPPING AND THEY GOT ANOTHER PERFECT HAT
WELL THIS STORY WELL I THINK THE STORY IS ABOUT
SIL
UHM THIS KID NAMED DANNY WHO GOT GROUNDED FOR SHAVING HIS CAT
SIL
AND HE WAS TELLING TONS OF DIFFERENT THINGS ABOUT WHY HE SHAVED THE CAT THAT WEREN'T REALLY TRUE IN THE STORY
SIL
AND

RACER THE DOG
WHEN HIS OWNER GOT HIM AS A PUPPY ALL HE WANTED TO DO WAS RUN AND RUN SO HIS OWNER NAMED HIM RACER
THEN WHEN HE GOT OLDER HE DEVELOPED PROBLEMS WITH HIS BACK LEGS
EVERY TIME HE RAN HE WOULD LIMP
BUT THAT DIDN'T STOP HIM FROM RUNNING BECAUSE LIKE MOST DOGS RACER LOVED TO L RUN
<unk> THERE WAS A DOG PARK NEAR WHERE THEY LIVED
HE ENJOYED PLAYING AT THE DOG PARK BECAUSE HE HAD HE DIDN'T HAVE TO BE ON HIS LEASH WHEN HE WAS THERE SO HE COULD RUN AS MUCH AS HE LIKED
THERE WAS ONE DOG THAT AT THE PARK THAT SIL UM NAMED FANG
<br> HE WOULD ALWAYS COME UP TO RACER AND BITE HIS BACK LEGS AND RUN AWAY SAYING BARK BARK BARK BARK
WHICH IN DOG TALK MEANS YOU ARE TOO SLOW TO CATCH ME WITH THAT LIMP OF YOURS SO I'M GOING TO PICK ON YOU
RACER WOULD ALWAYS CHASE FANG BUT HE COULD NEVER CATCH HIM
ONE DAY RACER WENT TO THE VET
RACER LIKED THE VET BECAUSE THE PEOPLE IN THE WHITE COATS GAVE HIM TREATS
RACER DIDN'T KNOW IT BUT HE WAS AT THE VET TO HAVE SURGERY TO FIX HIS LEGS
<br> WHEN HE WOKE UP FROM THE SURGERY HE DIDN'T EVEN REMEMBER WHERE HE WAS BUT SOON HIS OWNERS CAME AND DROVE HIM HOME
ON THE DRIVE HOME RACER REALIZED THAT HIS LEGS ITCHED VERY BADLY
HE THOUGHT OH BOY I'M GOING TO LICK MY LEG SO HARD THAT THE ITCHING IS GOING TO GO AWAY
SO HE TURNED HIS HEAD AROUND TO LICK HIS LEG BUT THERE WAS A BIG WHITE THING IN HIS WAY
HE WAS WEARING A COLLAR THAT MADE IT IMPOSSIBLE TO LICK HIS LEGS
A FEW DAYS LATER HE WENT WITH HIS OWNERS TO THE DOG PARK

RACER'S OWNERS SAID GO RUN

RACER SAID BARK BARK WHICH IN DOG TALK MEANS DON'T PICK ON ME ANY MORE FANG

RACER WAS SO HAPPY THAT HE COULDN'T RUN FAST THAT HE RAN AND RAN IN CIRCLES
FINALLY HE RAN BACK TO HIS OWNER OWNERS WHO GAVE HIM THE BIG KISSES FOR FIXING HIS LEGS
I READ ABOUT A DOG NAMED RACER WHO HAD A PROBLEMS WITH HIS BACK LEGS AND LOVED TO RUN BUT HE COULDN'T RUN VERY FAST BECAUSE OF HIS LEGS

HE THOUGHT IT WAS GREAT IT TOTALLY FIT HIS HEAD
HE LOVED THE WAY IT WAS A LITTLE TIGHT AT FIRST BUT THEN STRETCHED TO THE PERFECT SIZE
HE LOVED THE COLOR THE SIZE THE SHAPE AND THE NEW HAT SMELL
HE EVEN LIKED THE WAY HIS HAIR LOOKED WHEN HE TOOK OFF THE HAT OFF
<br> UNFORTUNATELY JUSTIN WAS TOO SMART FOR HIS OWN GOOD
<br> HE FIGURED OUT THAT THE HAT WOULD GET DIRTY OR LOST IF HE WORE IT TOO MUCH
<br> SO HE MADE A PROMISE TO HIMSELF THAT HE WOULD NEVER WEAR IT EXCEPT ON SPECIAL DAYS
HE WANTED THE HAT TO BE CLEAN AND PERFECT FOREVER
IF IT GETS DIRTY I'LL WASH IT SILLY SAID HIS MOTHER
BUT IT'LL SHRINK IF YOU WASH IT AND THEN IT'LL BE TOO SMALL HE SAID
SIL HIS FATHER SAID YOU SHOULD REALLY WEAR THE HAT IF YOU LIKE IT OR ELSE YOU'LL YOU WILL BE SORRY
BUT JUSTIN DIDN'T LISTEN AND EVERYDAY THE HAT SAT IN A CLEAR PLASTIC BOX SO THAT IT WOULDN'T GET DIRTY
SOMETIMES JUSTIN WOULD IMAGINE HIMSELF WALKING AROUND SCHOOL WITH THE HAT ON HIS HEAD
ONCE HE EVEN IMAGINED HIMSELF AS A GROWN UP WEARING THE HAT AND SPEAKING IN FRONT OF MANY PEOPLE
HE IMAGINED THE PEOPLE WHISPERING TO THEMSELVES WHAT A FINE FIGURE SPEAKER HE IS AND SUCH A HANDSOME HAT TOO
<br> ON HIS NEXT BIRTHDAY HE DECIDED TO WEAR THE HAT
<br> THERE WERE MANY PRESENTS BUT THE ONLY THING THAT MADE JUSTIN EXCITED WAS GETTING TO WEAR HIS HAT
HE WENT TO HIS ROOM OPENED THE PLASTIC BOX AND TOOK THE HAT OUT VERY CAREFULLY
<br> THEN HE SLOWLY SLID IT ON
IT WAS A LITTLE TIGHT AT FIRST
IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE
IT WAS JUST LIKE HE REMEMBERED
HE WAS SO HAPPY THAT HE COULDN'T HELP BUT SMILE
<br> I JUST N I JUST I I KNOW IT'S JUST A HAT HE THOUGHT TO HIMSELF BUT I SURE DO LOVE IT
BUT THEN HE NOTICED THAT IT WASN'T STRETCHING
SOMETHING WAS WRONG IT WAS A LITTLE TIGHT
JUSTIN COULD TELL IT JUST WASN'T PERFECT ANYMORE
<br> HE KNEW CRYING WOULDN'T HELP MAKE THE HAT PERFECT AGAIN BUT HE CRIED ANYWAY
HE TOLD HIS PARENTS I DON'T WANT ANY OF THOSE GIFTS I WANT TO RETURN THEM ALL AND TRY TO FIND A NEW PERFECT HAT INSTEAD
HIS PARENTS LOOKED AT EACH OTHER AND KNEW THAT JUSTIN HAD LEARNED A GOOD LESSON
<br> SON WE WOULD BE HAPPY TO BUY YOU A NEW HAT BUT ONLY IF YOU PROMISE TO WEAR IT THE FATHER SAID
JUSTIN REPLIED I PROMISE THAT IF WE FIND THE PERFECT HAT I'LL WEAR IT EVERYDAY

SO HE WANTS TO GO SHOPPING AND HE GETS A HAT AND IT'S PERFECT AND WHEN YOU PUT IT ON IT'S A JUST A LITTLE TIGHT AND THEN IT STRETCHES OUT TO THE RIGHT SIZE

RACER WAS RUNNING FASTER THAN HE COULD EVER REMEMBER THAT
SIL
REMEMBER THAT BEFORE HE KNEW IT HE HAD CAUGHT UP TO FANG AND KNOCKED HIM DOWN
RACER SAID BARK BARK WHICH IN DOG TALK MEANS DON'T PICK ON ME ANY MORE FANG
AND FROM THAT DAY ON FANG NEVER BIT RACER'S LEG
RACER WAS SO HAPPY THAT HE COULD RUN FAST THAT HE RAN AND RAN IN CIRCLES
FINALLY HE RAN BACK TO HIS OWNER AND GAVE HIM BIG KISSES FOR FIXING HIS LEGS
THE END
UM RACER USED TO BE A REALLY FAST DOG AND THEN HE STARTED TO LIMP
AND I THINK HE STARTED TO LIMP BY BECAUSE FANG KEPT ON BITING HIM IN THE LEG AND IT <br> MIGHT HAVE BROKE UP HIS MUSCLES OR SOMETHING <br> AND UM
SIL
I THOUGHT THE STORY WAS <br> UM A GOOD STORY BECAUSE

DIANA SHOOK HER HEAD GLEEFULLY HER BLACK EYES DANCING WITH MERRIMENT
<br> THEN HE PULLED THE HOOD OF HIS CLOAK OVER HIS EARS AND OVER HIS BROW
WHICH OF YOU BOYS PLACED THIS STONE SIGNAL ASKED THE YOUNG EXPLORER
THEY SHOOK THE FLOUR OFF HER AND SET HER DOWN ON THE KITCHEN FLOOR
I BEG YOUR PARDON SAID THE LEARNED MAN IS IT AN OLD HABIT OH IT IS AN OLD HABIT WITH ME
<br> SHE SAW THAT SHE WAS ON THE GRASS AND THE BROKEN WHEEL BESIDE HER
SIL
THE AIRPLANE RIDE
THE FIRST TIME I EVER TOOK AN AIRPLANE BY MYSELF IT WAS FUN AND SCARY
I DIDN'T KNOW ANYONE AT ALL AND HAD TO GO ALL THE WAY FROM NEW YORK TO TEXAS WITHOUT MY PARENTS
I WAS GOING THERE TO SEE MY GRANDFATHER WE WERE GOING TO GO FISHING
I'VE ALWAYS THOUGHT FLYING WAS FUN
YOU GO HIGHER THAN ANY MOUNTAIN AND YOU GO FASTER THAN ANY CAR
BUT TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH WITHOUT MY PARENTS THERE I WAS PRETTY NERVOUS
I GUESS IT WAS BECAUSE THE PLANE WAS SO LOUD AND I DIDN'T KNOW ANYONE
I WAS STARTING
SIL
THINKING WE MIGHT CRASH
SIL
OH I STARTED THINKING WE MIGHT CRASH
SIL
<br> I DIDN'T LIKE TO THINK ABOUT THAT BUT I COULDN'T HELP IT THAT'S WHEN I MISSED MY PARENTS THE MOST
ONCE THE PLANE WAS IN THE AIR I WAS PRETTY GOOD
MY MOM GAVE ME A COLORING BOOK OF COOL LOOKING DRAGONS TO KEEP ME BUSY I COLORED THE DRAGON PICTURES ALL GREEN SO IT DIDN'T TAKE VERY LONG
I ONLY USED THE GREEN CRAYON BECAUSE
SIL
IT WAS
SIL
BECAUSE IT WAS THE TALLEST AND I WANTED IT TO CATCH UP TO THE RED BROWN BLUE YELLOW PURPLE AND BLACK ONES
SIL
ONE THING ABOUT BEING BY YOURSELF ON AN AIRPLANE
IS THAT THE FLIGHT ATTENDANTS ARE VERY NICE TO YOU
I HAD SEVEN COLA'S AND FOUR GINGER ALE'S BY THE TIME
SIL
WAIT
SIL
WHICH MADE ME HAVE TO GO TO THE BATHROOM EIGHT TIMES
I WAS GLAD THAT THERE WASN'T ANYONE NEXT TO ME
THE PERSON NEXT TO ME WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY ANNOYED
SIL
EVEN THE FLIGHT ATTENDANT SEEMED A LITTLE ANNOYED THAT I HAD TO GO TO THE BATHROOM SO MUCH BUT IT WAS HER FAULT
FOR SOME REASON SHE KEPT TRYING TO GIVE ME PEANUTS
BUT I TOLD HER THAT I WOULD LIKE A BANANA SPLIT INSTEAD
SHE SAID THEY DON'T HAVE ANY BANANA BANANA SPLITS ON THE PLANE BUT SOMETIMES PEOPLE LIKE TO EAT PEANUTS ON THEIR BANANA SPLITS
I TOLD HER THAT IT WAS THE PEANUTS THAT WERE MAKING ME SO THIRSTY IN THE FIRST PLACE
AND THAT IF SHE WOULD
GET ME A BANANA SPLIT I WOULDN'T HAVE TO GO THE BATHROOM SO MUCH
SHE TOLD ME TO BE QUIET AND WATCH THE MOVIE
I TRIED TO WATCH THE MOVIE
BUT I HAD ALREADY SEEN THAT ONE SO IT WAS BORING
THE FLIGHT ATTENDANT GAVE ME A DECK OF CARDS BUT SHE WOULDN'T PLAY GO FISH WITH ME
SHE SAID THAT SHE HAD TO HELP OTHER PASSENGERS
SIL
I HAD A GAME BOY IN MY BACKPACK MY BACKPACK WAS IN THE OVERHEAD THINGY
SIL
I TRIED TO PUSH THE BUTTON THAT LIGHTS UP SO THE FLIGHT ATTENDANT WOULD COME BUT GUESS WHAT I WAS TOO SHORT TO REACH THE BUTTON
SO I STARTED YELLING HEY PEANUT LADY HEY PEANUT LADY
SHE DIDN'T LIKE BEING CALLED PEANUT LADY
BUT SHE DID GET ME MY GAME BOY
SHE TOLD ME TO CALL HER JENNIFER INSTEAD
I PLAYED ON MY GAME BOY UNTIL I GOT MY NEW HIGH SCORE
THEN JENNIFER CAME UP TO ME AND SAID SHE HAD A SURPRISE I THOUGHT GREAT MORE PEANUTS
BUT IT WASN'T PEANUTS IT WAS SOMETHING REALLY COOL
SHE SAID THE CAPTAIN WAS INVITING ME TO SEE THE COCKPIT I THOUGHT AWESOME
I ALSO BROUGHT MY DECK OF CARDS IN CASE THE PILOT WAS BORED AND WANTED TO PLAY GO FISH
JENNIFER TOOK ME INTO THE COCKPIT PIT AND THERE
SIL
AND THERE WERE LIKE A MILLION BUTTONS AND LEVERS AND KNOBS AND STUFF
SUDDENLY I THOUGHT WOW LOOK AT ALL OF THOSE BUTTONS
THEN I THOUGHT THERE'S NO WAY THAT ANYONE CAN REMEMBER TO PUSH ALL THOSE BUTTONS AT THE RIGHT TIME
WE ARE GOING TO CRASH
SIL
THE WAY I FIGURED IT MY GAME BOY
ONLY HAS FIVE BUTTONS AND I CAN'T GET PAST LEVEL THREE
IMAGINE HOW HARD IT WOULD BE TO WORK ALL THOSE MILLIONS OF BUTTONS AND EAT PEANUTS AND GO TO THE BATHROOM
THE PILOT TOLD ME THAT IT WASN'T REALLY THAT HARD ONCE YOU PRACTICED
THEN HE TOLD ME THAT HE ONCE PLAYED A GAME
AND I H
I HAD ON MY GAME BOY AND HE COULDN'T EVEN PASS LEVEL ONE
I SAID IF YOU CAN'T GET PAST LEVEL ONE
AND YOU CAN BE A PILOT THEN I COULD BE A PILOT TOO SINCE I'M MUCH BETTER AT PUSHING BUTTONS THAN YOU ARE
HE LAUGHED EVEN THOUGH I WASN'T JOKING
<br> HE SAID HE THOUGHT I WOULD MAKE A GREAT PILOT SOMEDAY IF I WANTED TO BE
HE WAS REALLY NICE BUT HE WOULDN'T PLAY GO FISH WITH ME
FINALLY WE LANDED
THAT'S ALWAYS SCARY BECAUSE IT SEEMS LIKE EVEN THOUGH YOU ARE
WE WERE ON THE
WE ARE ON THE GROUND
BUT THE PLANE IS GOING TO
F
IS GOING TOO FAST TO EVER STOP
SIL
FINALLY WE LANDED
THAT'S ALWAYS SCARY BECAUSE IT SEEMS LIKE EVEN THOUGH WE WERE
ON THE GROUND
THAT THE PLANE IS GOING TOO FAST TO EVER STOP
BUT IT DID
WHEN I GOT OFF THE AIRPLANE THERE WAS GRANDPA WAITING FOR ME HE SAID HOW WAS YOUR FLIGHT
I SAID SOMEDAY I'M GOING TO BE A PILOT
AND I'LL ONLY SERVE BANANA SPLITS ON MY PLANE
<br> GRANDPA LAUGHED THEN TOOK ME STRAIGHT TO THE ICE CREAM SHOP
IT WAS WORTH THE WHOLE TRIP JUST TO EAT A BANANA SPLIT WITH GRANDPA
THE STORY'S ABOUT UHM THIS BOY AND HE'S GOING ON THE AIRPLANE FOR THE FIRST TIME ALONE <br>
AND UHM <br> HE TALKS ABOUT HOW THE FLIGHT ATTENDANT KEEPS ON TRYING TO GIVE HIM PEANUTS INSTEAD OF WHAT HE WANTS A BANANA SPLIT
AND UHM HE'S KIND OF BORED HE COLORS AND
AND TRI AND HE PLAYS HIS GAMEBOY BUT HE DOESN'T HE ISN'T ABLE TO GET TO THE HIGHEST LEVEL ONLY LEVEL THREE <br>
AND THEN UHM HE GETS TO GO INTO THE COCKPIT AND TALK <br> TO THE PILOT AND UHM <br>
HE WANTS THE PILOT TO PLAY WITH HIM GO FISH BUT <br> THE PILOT CAN'T PLAY <br>
AND UHM AND THEN WHEN HE FINALLY LANDS HE'S REALLY SCARED ABOUT THE LANDING BUT THEN IT'S OVER AND HE MEETS HIS GRANDPA AND TELLS HIM HE WANTS TO BE A PILOT WHEN HE'S OLDER AND
THEN HE GOES TO THE ICE CREAM SHOP AND GETS A BANANA SPLIT <br>
AFTER THE USUAL CEREMONIES THE PRINCE PRESENTED <unk> HIS PROPOSAL <unk>
RATHER WOULD F I FACE THREE STRONG MEN THAN ONE YOUNG DAMSEL
I WOULD LOVE DEARLY TO HEAR THESE PEOPLE DESCRIBE THEIR TRAVELS
SIL
THROUGHOUT THESE CONVERSATIONS SAM HODGE SELDOM SPOKE
NOW HE HAS GONE OFF AGAIN FOR THE GAME IS GETTING SCARCE
YES MY LORD SAID THE MAN HIS SUNBURNED FACE REDDENING
EVEN IF THERE HAS BEEN SOME LITTLE MISTAKE WHAT COULD I DO NOW TO FIX IT
FOR SEVERAL DAYS THIS STRANGELY ASSORTED PAIR ROAMED THE JUNGLE TOGETHER
THE EARL LOOKED AT IT AND THE CORNERS OF HIS MOUTH TWITCHED
FOR YOU AND ME THERE IS NOTHING TO HOPE FOR NOTHING BEYOND WHAT WE HAVE
IF GOD SPARES BETH I NEVER WILL COMPLAIN AGAIN M WHISPERED MEG EARNESTLY
THESE THOUGHTS HAUNTED HIM ALL DAY AND HE DREAMT THEM ALL NIGHT
FOR NOTHING BRINGS JOY TO THE HEART LIKE THE COMING OF SPRING
SHE COULD SEE NOTHING EXCEPT THE MORNING GLORIES WHICH COVERED THE SIDE OF THE PORCH
WE NEVER KNEW THAT SUCH STRANGE PEOPLE EXISTED ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD
SHE MUST BEGIN WITH THE CHINESE DYNASTY <unk> AND THE END IT JAPAN WITH JAPAN
IN THE DEEP GLOOM SHE COULD NOT SEE THE ANGER WHICH DARKENED HIS FACE
DIANA SEARCHED FAITHFULLY BUT NO AXE WAS TO BE FOUND IN THE WHOLE WOODSHED
SHE WANTS TO GIVE THAT BOY AN EXTREMELY BAD OPINION OF ME
SIL
I KNOW THE COUNTY STOCK LAW JUST AS WELL AS YOU DO
HOW STRANGE THAT A LIVE ANIMAL SHOULD GROW ON A STALK LIKE A FLOWER
I GUESS I'LL BUY A FEW SNAKES SINCE THEY LOOK SO FUNNY COILING OUT
SIL
SEE THE WISDOM OF MY CHOICE HE SAID HOLDING UP THE LARGE LEAF OF GOLD
BUT I AM TOO OLD TO ENDURE YOUR SHAME AND MISERY MUCH LONGER
SIL
ROOSTER JOHN
BEFORE I TELL YOU
HOW ROOSTER JOHN GOT HIS NAME
YOU SHOULD KNOW A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE TOWN OF FRANKSVILLE
<br> FRANKSVILLE WAS A TOWN THAT SEEMED TO HAVE ONE PROBLEM AFTER THE OTHER
<br> THEIR PROBLEMS STARTED WHEN THEY RAN OUT OF WATER
<br> THANKFULLY WHEN SOMEONE WAS DIGGING A HOLE AND FOUND WATER
<br> BUT SOON AFTER THAT THEY STARTED TO GET FLIES
THEY GOT TONS AND TONS OF FLIES
THEN THE FLIES STOPPED
SIL
BUT JUST THEN A MAN MOVED TO TOWN PLAYING A FLUTE SO BADLY THAT THE PEOPLE WOULD RUN AWAY SCREAMING
SIL
WHY DON'T YOU
WHY DID THEY
SIL
EVER INVENT EARS
MAYBE A POORLY PLAYED FLUTE DOESN'T SOUND ALL THAT BAD
BUT JUST TRY TO IMAGINE SOMEONE SCRATCHING A CHALKBOARD
WITH A FORK AND THEN MULTIPLY THAT TIMES A HUNDRED
THAT'S HOW THE FLUTE SOUNDED WHEN THIS GUY PLAYED IT
<br> I'M SERIOUS
STILL IT'S NOT AS BAD AS A MILLION FLIES I SUPPOSE
THE FLUTE THE BAD FLUTE PLAYER WAS ROOSTER JOHN
IT WA HE WASN'T CALLED ROOSTER JOHN YET
THAT CAME LATER
HE WAS THE NEW TOWN DENTIST
HE WAS AN EXC EXCELLENT DENTIST
SIL
BUT HIS REAL LOVE WAS MUSIC
HE PLAYED MANY MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS SUCH AS THE GUITAR TUBA AND THE PIANO AND THE CLARINET
BUT FOR SOME REASON
THE WAY HIS MOUTH WAS SHAPED MADE THE FLUTE SOUND SO BAD THAT
HIS FISH WOULD JUMP OUT OF THEIR FISH BOWL
SIL
WE CAN'T LET YOU PLAY THE FLUTE ANYMORE JOHN SAID THE POLICE CHIEF SANDERS
THE NEIGHBORS ARE COMPLAINING AND THE CATS AND DOGS ARE TRYING TO CHEW OFF THEIR EARS
BUT I HAVE TO PLAY I WAS BORN TO DO IT I DON'T KNOW WHY
BUT I FEEL LIKE I HAVE TO OR ELSE I'M
ELSE SOMETHING BAD WILL HAPPEN
<br> LOOK JOHN I'VE HEARD YOU PLAY THE CLARINET YOU'RE QUITE GOOD
WHY DON'T YOU PLAY THAT INSTEAD THE POLICE SAID THE POLICE SANDERS
OH THAT'S A NICE INSTRUMENT BUT IT'S NOT THE FLUTE
I WROTE YOU A SONG WITH THE FLUTE CALLED
COPS AND ROBBERS THEN HE PLAYED THE SONG FOR POLICE SANDERS
THE POLICE HATED THE SOUND SO MUCH THAT HE THREW JOHN IN JAIL
<br> BUT THEY COULDN'T KEEP JOHN IN JAIL SINCE
SIL
THE
SIL
WASN'T REALLY BREAKING ANY
SIL
LAWS SO THERE WAS NOTHING
SIL
<unk> SO SHOULD I START HERE
SIL
<br> SINCE HE WASN'T REALLY BREAKING ANY LAWS
SO THERE IS NOTHING THAT THE POLICE COULD DO
BESIDES EVERYONE LOVED JOHN
SINCE HE HAD BECOME THE TOWN DENTIST EVERYBODY'S TEETH WERE MUCH WHITER AND CLEANER
AND NO ONE HAD ANY CAVITIES
<br> SO THERE IS A PROBLEM
IN THE LITTLE TOWN OF FRANKSVILLE WHAT SHOULD THEY DO
THEY COULDN'T KEEP JOHN IN JAIL
THEY DIDN'T WANT TO KICK HIM OUT OF THE TOWN BECAUSE THEY
ALL HAD SUCH NICE TEETH
SO THEY DECIDED THAT JOHN COULD PLAY THE FLUTE AND EVERYBODY ELSE WOULD HAVE TO WEAR EARPLUGS
<br> WELL I'M SURE YOU GUESSED THAT DIDN'T WORK
NO ONE COULD HEAR ANYTHING PEOPLE WERE GETTING INTO CAR ACCIDENTS AND
SIL
<unk> AND <unk>
EVERYBODY LOOKED REALLY SILLY AT DANCES
DANCING TO MUSIC THAT THEY COULDN'T REALLY HEAR
<br> THEY JUST COULDN'T READ LEAD A NORMAL LIFE
SIL
THEN THEY DECIDED TO LOWER HIM DOWN IN A WELL AND LET HIM PLAY WHERE NO ONE COULD HEAR HIM
JOHN THOUGHT THAT WAS AN OK IDEA BUT THERE IS S
AN ECHO IN THE WELL THAT MADE THE FLUTE SOUND LOUDER
WINDOWS WERE BREAKING AND ALL THE COWS IN TOWN STARTED TO MAKE SOUR MILK
<br> THE LOCAL
ESPECIALLY SHAPED FOR JOHN'S MOUTH THEN PERHAPS HE COULD PLAY THE FLUTE NORMALLY
GUESS WHAT IT WORKED
DOCTOR WRONG WRONG WAS
SIL
THE TOWN HERO
<br> THE FLUTE SOUNDED NORMAL AND IT TURNED OUT THAT JOHN COULD PLAY IT QUITE WELL
<br> THE PEOPLE IN THE TOWN DECIDED TO HAVE A GREAT BIG PARADE IN FRANKSVILLE TO CELEBRATE THE FACT THAT
FOR ONCE THERE WAS NO WATER PROBLEM NO FLY PROBLEM AND NO FLUTE PROBLEM
SIL
DOCTOR WRONG AND JOHN WERE THE STARS OF THE PARADE
SO THEY WERE ON THE MAIN FLOAT
<br> A BIG BAND BAND PLAYED AS THEY MARCHED UP AND DOWN MAIN STREET EVERYONE CHEERED
SIL
THEN SUDDENLY A FLY LANDED ON A LITTLE GIRL AND THEN
UHM ANOTHER ON A LIL ON A BIG GIRL
SIL
THEN ONE LANDED ON EVERYONE
SIL
THEN TWO LANDED ON EVERYONE
SOON T THEN SOON TONS OF FLIES
SIL
WERE LANDING ON EVERYONE
BEFORE THEY KNEW IT THE TOWN WAS FILLED WITH FLIES AGAIN
OH NO SAID THE POLICE SANDERS
JUST WHEN THINGS WERE GOING GOOD FOR FRANKSVILLE
<br> JOHN DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO SO HE KEPT PLAYING HIS FLUTE
THE FLIES WERE SO ANNOYING SO HE WOULD SWAT AT THEM WITH HIS HAND
SIL
OR EVEN
SIL
WITH HIS NEW FLUTE
HE STARTED SHAKING THE FLUTE TO GET THE FLIES OFF
AND ACCIDENTALLY SMASHED IT INTO PIECES HE WAS VERY UPSET AT FIRST THEN HE SAID OH WELL GOOD THING I BROUGHT MY OLD FLUTE AS A BACK UP
SIL
NO NO PLEASE DON'T PLAY YOUR OLD FLUTE BEGGED DOCTOR WRONG
BUT IT WAS TOO LATE JOHN HAD STARTED PLAYING
WHEN THE TOWNSFOLKS HEARD THE NOISE THEY COULDN'T EVEN SWAT AT THE FLIES ANYMORE
<br> THEY HAD TO COVER THEIR EARS FROM THE HORRIBLE SOUND
THE FLIES WOULD LAND ALL OVER THE PEOPLE AND THEY COULDN'T SWAT THEM OFF
IT WAS GROSS THEN SUDDENLY THE FLIES FLEW AWAY FAST AS THEY COULD
IT'S THE FLUTE SONG THE FLIES HATE
JOHN'S FLUTE PLAYING AS MUCH AS WE DO
SIL
JOHN WAS THE DENTIST JOHN THE DENTIST IS DRIVING AWAY THE FLIES
SIL
IT WAS THEN THE PEOPLE OF FRANKSVILLE REALIZED THAT THEY HAD
WOULD HAVE TO TAKE THE GOOD WITH THE BAD
BECAUSE AS BAD AS THE FLUTE SOUNDED IT WAS A LOT BETTER THAN THE THOUSANDS OF FLIES CRAWLING ON THEM
FROM THEN ON JOHN WOULD WAKE UP AT SUNRISE LIKE A ROOSTER AND PLAY TO KEEP THE FLIES AWAY
UHM WELL IN ROOSTER JOHN THEY UHM THE GUY PLAYED THE FLUTE REALLY BADLY
AND SO THE FLIES WENT AWAY AND THEN AND EVERYBODY HATED THE FLUTE SO THEY HAD TO PLUG THEIR EARS AND THEN UHM
ONE DAY DOCTOR WONG FOUND A WAY TO MAKE THE FLUTE SOUND BETTER AND THEN ALL THE FLIES CAME BACK
AND UHM ROOSTER JOHN
SIL
BROKE HIS NEW FLUTE AND SO HE PLAYED AND OLD ONE AGAIN AND ALL THE FLIES WENT AWAY
SO EVERYBODY WAS HAPPY THAT FLIES WENT AWAY BUT NOT EXACTLY HAPPY WITH THE SOUND SO THEN UHM HE JUST UHM WOKE UP EVERY MORNING LIKE A ROOSTER TO PLAY HIS FLUTE TO MAKE THE FLIES GO AWAY
SIL
UHM THEY WANTED THEY DECIDED THAT EVERYONE SHOULD WEAR EARPLUGS BUT THAT DIDN'T REALLY WORK BECAUSE THEN THEY COULDN'T REALLY HEAR THE MUSIC THEY WERE DANCING TO <br>
AND THEN THEY ALSO PUT JOHN IN JAIL BUT THAT DIDN'T WORK CAUSE HE COULDN'T REALLY BE IN JAIL FOR PLAYING A FLUTE BADLY
AND SO UHM THEY DIDN'T REALLY WORK I DON'T KNOW
<br> THE RED LEAVES WERE BURNER BLOWN AROUND IN MILLIONS BY THE WIND
BEHIND LAY THE SHIP A PICTURE NOT WITHOUT ITS LIGHTER SIDE

<br> YOU GO HIGHER THAN ANY MOUNTAIN AND YOU GO FASTER THAN ANY CAR
<br> BUT TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH WITHOUT MY PARENTS THERE I WAS PRETTY NERVOUS
<br> I GUESS IT WAS BECAUSE THE PLANE WAS SO LOUD AND I DIDN'T KNOW ANYONE
<br> I STARTED THINKING WE MIGHT C CRASH I DIDN'T LIKE TO THINK ABOUT THAT BUT I COULDN'T HELP IT
<br> THAT'S WHEN I MISSED MY PAR PARENTS THE MOST
ONCE THE PLANE WAS IN THE AIR I WAS PRETTY GOOD
SIL
<br> MY MOM GAVE ME A COLORING BOOK OF COOL LOOKING DRAGONS TO KEEP ME BUSY

CRAYON BECAUSE IT WAS THE TALLEST AND I WANTED IT TO CATCH UP W
SIL
I WANTED IT TO CATCH UP TO THE RED BROWN BLUE YELLOW PURPLE AND BLACK ONES
SIL
<br> ONE THING ABOUT BEING BY YOURSELF ON AN AIRPLANE IS THAT THE
SIL
I HAD SEVEN COLA'S AND FOUR GINGER ALE'S WHICH MADE ME HAVE TO GO TO THE BATHROOM EIGHT TIMES
I WAS GLAD THAT THERE WASN'T ANYONE NEXT TO ME THE PERSON NEXT TO ME WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY ANNOYED
SIL
EVEN THE FLIGHT
SIL
ATTENDANT SEEMED A LITTLE ANNOYED THAT I HAD TO GO TO THE BATHROOM SO MUCH
<br> BUT IT WAS HER FAULT
FOR SOME REASON SHE KEPT TRYING TO GIVE ME PEANUTS BUT I TOLD HER THAT I WOULD LIKE A BANANA SPLIT INSTEAD
<br> SHE SAID THEY DON'T HAVE ANY BANANA SPLITS ON THE PLANE BUT SOMETIMES PEOPLE LIKE TO EAT P PEANUTS ON THEIR BANANA SPLITS
<br> I TOLD HER THAT IT WAS THE PEANUTS THAT WERE MAKING ME SO THIRSTY IN THE FIRST PLACE AND THAT IF SHE'D
THAT IF SHE WOULD GET ME A
BANANA SPLIT I WOULDN'T HAVE TO GO THE BATHROOM SO MUCH
SIL
<br> SHE TOLD ME TO BE QUIET AND WATCH THE MOVIE

SUDDENLY I THOUGHT WOW LOOK AT ALL THOSE BUTTONS THEN I THOUGHT THERE'S NO WAY ANYONE CAN REMEMBER TO PUSH ALL THOSE BUTTONS AT THE RIGHT TIME
WE ARE GOING TO CRASH
SIL
THE WAY I FIGURED IT MY GAME BOY
HAS ONLY FIVE BUTTONS AND I CAN
CAN'T GET PAST LEVEL THREE IMAGINE HOW HARD IT WOULD BE TO WORK ALL THOSE MILLIONS
OF BUTTONS AND EAT PEANUTS A AND GO TO THE BATHROOM
THE PILOT TOLD ME THAT IT WASN'T REALLY HARD ONCE YOU PRA ONCE YOU PRACTICED

WHEN I GOT OFF THE AIRPLANE THERE WAS GRANDPA WAITING FOR ME
HE SAID HOW WAS YOUR FLIGHT AND I SAID SOMEDAY I'M GOING TO BE P
PI A PILOT AND UH I'LL ONLY SERVE BANANA SPLITS ON MY PLANE
SIL
GRANDPA LAUGHED AND THEN TOOK ME STRAIGHT TO THE ICE CREAM SHOP IT WAS WORTH THE WHOLE TRIP JUST TO EAT A BANANA SPLIT WITH GRANDPA
UHM I THOUGHT THE STORY WAS LIKE KIND OF FUNNY IN THAT HE HE WANTED A BANANA SPLIT ON THE AIRPLANE
AND THAT HE UH CALLED THE LADY A PEANUT LADY AND WANTED TO KNOW IF THE PILOT WOULD HAVE TIME TO PLAY GO FISH EVEN THOUGH HE WAS FLYING THE PLANE TO MAKE SURE IT DIDN'T CRASH WHICH HE WAS AFRAID OF
SIL
AND UH
SIL
<br> THIS KID GETS ON THE PLANE
AND HE'S KIND OF SCARED THAT IT MIGHT CRASH AND THE FLIGHT ATTENDANT IS KIND OF NICE EVEN THOUGH SHE GETS ANNOYED THAT HE HAS TO GO TO THE BATHROOM
HE HAS TO GO TO HE BATHROOM A LOT CAUSE HE'S GIVING HER A LOT OF PEANUTS PEANUTS AND THE PEANUTS ARE MAKING HIM THIRSTY
<br> SO HE DRANK LIKE FOUR COKES AND THREE GINGER ALES OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
AND THEN THE FLIGHT ATTENDANT GAVE GAVE HIM A DECK OF CARDS AND HE WANTED HER TO PLAY GO FISH WITH HER BUT HE WOULDN'T

SIL
PEANUT LADY BUT UH AND SHE SHE CAME OVER AND WAS LIKE DON'T CALL ME PEANUT LADY MY NAME IS JENNIFER

THE EARL'S NEXT SPEECH DASHED THAT HOPE INTO A THOUSAND FRAGMENTS
SIL
THE NEXT MOMENT HE CHANGED THE SUBJECT BECAUSE IT SEEMED THE BEST THING TO DO
HARRISON CHUCKLED A IF HE CHUCKLED AT ALL IN PRIVATE AND AND WAS ALL SYMPATHY OUTWARD
SIL
HEARING THO HEARING THESE WORDS JIM RESOLVED TO CONQUER HIS ALARM BY HIMSELF
<br> THEN HE SEEMED TO BREATHE MORE FIERCELY AND RECOVERED SOME OF HIS JAUNTY IMP IMPUDENCE
SIL
THEN THE ROPES WERE ATTACHED AND EVERYBODY PULLED VIGOROUSLY
NOT EVEN HER WRATH AT THE GIRL'S INSOLENCE COULD WHOLLY OVERCOME HER WONDER
THE MISTRESS STOOD STOCK TALL HOLDING HER HANDS LEVEL AT LEVEL WITH HER THROAT
THE WOMEN REPLIED ONLY BY VANISHING AS THOUGH SUDDENLY MIXED WITH A THE AIR
SHE LOOSENED THE SHE HAD LOOSENED THE LID AND THEN SHE LAU LAUGHINGLY SAT ON IT

SIL
THIS LITTLE JOHN DID THOUGH WITHOUT DISTURBING HIS MASTER OR RISING FROM WHERE HE SAT
SIL
BEFORE I TELL YOU HOW ROOSTER JOHN GOT HIS NAME
YOU SHOULD KNOW A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE TOWN OF FRANKSVILLE
FRANKSVILLE WAS A TOWN THAT SEEMED TO HAVE ONE PROBLEM AFTER THE OTHER
THEIR PROBLEMS STARTED WHEN THEY RAN OUT OF WATER
THANKFULLY SOMEONE WAS DIGGING A HOLE AND FOUND WATER
BUT SOON AFTER THAT THEY STARTED TO GET FLIES
THEY GOT TONS AND TONS OF FLIES
THEN THE FLIES STOPPED
BUT JUST THEN A MAN MOVED INTO TOWN
WHO PLAYED THE FLUTE SO BADLY THAT
PEOPLE W WOULD RUN AWAY SCREAMING
SIL
WHY
OH TH
TH WHY DID THEY EVER INVENT EARS
SIL
MAYBE A POORLY PLAYED FLUTE DOESN'T SOUND ALL THAT BAD
BUT JUST TRY TO IMAGINE SOMEONE SCRATCHING A CHALKBOARD WITH A FORK
AND THEN MULTIPLY THAT TIMES A HUNDRED
THAT'S HOW
SIL
THAT'S HOW THE FLUTE SOUNDED WHEN THIS GUY PLAYED IT
I'M SERIOUS
STILL IT'S NOT AS BAD AS MILLIONS OF FLIES I SUPPOSE
SIL
THE BAD FLUTE PLAYER WAS ROOSTER JOHN
SIL
HE WASN'T CALLED ROOSTER JOHN YET THAT CAME LATER
SIL
HE WAS THE NEW TOWN DENTIST
HE WAS AN EXCELLENT DENTIST BUT HIS REAL LOVE WAS MUSIC
SIL
HE PLAYED MANY MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS
SUCH AS THE GUITAR
THE TUBA THE PIANO AND THE CLARINET
BUT FOR SOME REASON
THE WAY HIS <unk> THE WAY HIS MOUTH WAS SHAPED
SIL
MADE A FLUTE SOUND AS SO BAD THAT HIS FISH WOULD JUMP OUT OF THEIR FISH BOWL
SIL
WHY CAN'T
SIL
WE CAN'T LET YOU PLAY THE FLUTE ANYMORE JOHN SAID POLICE CHIEF SANDERS
SIL
THE NEIGHBORS ARE COMPLAINING AND CATS
THE CATS AND DOGS ARE TRYING TO CHEW OFF THEIR EARS
SIL
BUT I HAVE TO PLAY

SAID POLICE CHIEF SANDERS
OH THAT'S A NICE INSTRUMENT BUT IT'S JUST NOT THE FLUTE
SIL
I WROTE YOU A SONG ON THE FLUTE IT'S CALLED COPS AND ROBBERS
THEN HE PLAYED THE SONG FOR POLICE CHIEF SANDERS
THE POLICE CHIEF HATED THE SOUND SO MUCH THAT HE THREW JOHN IN JAIL
SIL
BUT THEY COULDN'T KEEP
SIL
JOHN IN JAIL SINCE HE WASN'T REALLY BREAKING ANY LAWS SO THERE WAS NOTHING THE POLICE COULD DO
BESIDES EVERYBODY LOVED JOHN
SINCE HE
SIL
BE <unk>
SINCE HE HAD BECOME THE TOWN DENTIST EVERYBODY'S TEETH WERE MUCH WHITER AND CLEANER AND NOBODY <unk> AN
NO ONE HAD ANY CAVITIES
SIL

WHAT SHOULD THEY DO
SIL
THEY COULD KEEP <unk> THEY COULDN'T KEEP JOHN IN JAIL
AND THEY DIDN'T WANT TO KICK HIM OUT OF TOWN BECAUSE THEY ALL HAD SUCH NICE TEETH
SO THEY DECIDED THAT
SIL
JOHN COULD PLAY THE FLUTE AND EVERYONE ELSE WOULD HAVE <unk>
TO WEAR EARPLUGS
SIL
WELL I'M SURE
YOU GUESSED THAT DIDN'T WORK
NO ONE COULD HEAR ANYTHING PEOPLE WERE GETTING IN CAR ACCIDENTS AND
SIL
<unk> EVERYBODY LOOKED REALLY SILLY AT DANCES
DANCING TO MUSIC THEY COULDN'T HEAR <unk>
THEY JUST COULDN'T LEAD A NORMAL LIFE <unk>
SIL
THEN THEY DECIDED TO LOWER HIM DOWN A WELL AND LET HIM PLAY
WHERE DOWN WHERE NO ONE COULD HEAR HIM JOHN THOUGHT THAT WAS AN OKAY IDEA
BUT THERE WAS AN ECHO IN THE WELL THAT MADE THE FLUTE SOUND LOUDER
SIL
WINDOWS WERE BREAKING
SIL
AND ALL THE
SIL
COWS IN TOWN STARTED TO MAKE SOUR MILK
SIL
THE LOCAL SCIENTIST
DOCTOR WONG CAME UP WITH AN IDEA
HE THOUGHT THAT
SIL
HE THOUGHT IF HE MADE A NEW <unk> MOUTHPIECE ESPECIALLY SHAPED FOR JOHN'S MOUTH PERHAPS HE COULD PLAY THE FLUTE NORMALLY
AND GUESS WHAT
IT WORKED DOCTOR WONG WAS THE TOWN HERO
THE FLUTE SOUNDED NORMAL AND IT TURNED OUT JOHN COULD PLAY IT QUITE WELL
THE PEOPLE IN THE TOWN DECIDED TO HAVE A GREAT PARADE IN FRANKSVILLE AND CELEBRATE THE FACT THAT THERE WAS NO WATER PROBLEM
NO FLY PROBLEM
AND NO FLUTE PROBLEM
DOCTOR WONG AND JOHN WERE THE S STARS OF THE PARADE SO THEY
WERE ON THE MAIN FLOAT
SIL
A A BIG BAND PLAYED AS THEY MARCHED UP AND DOWN THE STREET

OH NO SAID POLICE CHIEF SANDERS JUST WHEN THINGS WERE GOING GOOD FOR FRANKSVILLE
SIL
JOHN DIDN'T KNOW WHAT
TO DO SO HE JUST KEPT ON PLAYING HIS FLUTE
THE FLIES WERE ANNOYING
SO HE WOULD SWAT AT AT THEM WITH HIS HAND OR EVEN HIS NEW FLUTE
HE STARTED SHAKING THE FLUTE TO GET THE FLIES OFF AND ACCIDENTALLY SMASHED IT INTO PIECES
SIL
HE WAS VERY UPSET AT FIRST <unk>
THEN HE SAID
OH WELL GOOD THING I BROUGHT MY OLD FLUTE AS A BACK UP
SIL

BEGGED TO DOCTOR WONG
IT WAS TOO LATE
JOHN HAD STARTED PLAYING
WHEN THE TOWNSFOLK <unk> HEARD THE NOISE THEY COULDN'T EVEN SWAT AT THE F
SIL
FLIES ANYMORE
THEY HAD TO COVER THEIR EARS FROM THE HORRIBLE SOUND
THE FLIES WOULD LAND ALL OVER THE PEOPLE AND THEY COULDN'T SWAT THEM OFF IT WAS GROSS
THEN SUDDENLY
SIL
THE FLIES FLEW AWAY AS FAST AS THEY COULD
SIL
DOCTOR WONG <unk> THOUGHT FOR A SECOND THEN PRONOUNCED
IT'S THE FLUTE SOUND
THE FLIES HATE
JOH <unk>
JOHN'S FLUTE PLAYING AS MUCH AS WE DO
JO <unk> JOHN THE DENTIST IS DRIVING THE FLIES AWAY
SIL
IT WAS
THEN WHEN THE PEOPLE OF FRANKSVILLE REALIZED THAT THEY
WOULD HAVE TO TAKE THE GOOD WITH THE BAD
SIL
BECAUSE <unk> AS BAD AS THE FLUTE SOUNDED
IT WAS A LOT BETTER THAN <unk> THOUSANDS OF FLIES CRAWLING ON THEM
FROM THEN ON
JOHN WOULD WAKE UP AT SUNRISE LIKE A ROOSTER AND PLAY TO KEEP THE FLIES AWAY
SO THAT STORY WAS ABOUT A GUY NAMED ROOSTER JOHN HE GOT HIS NAME FROM <unk> FROM HIS FLUTE PLAYING BECAUSE HE DID IT EVERY MORNING
AT FIRST THE PEOPLE DIDN'T LIKE HIS FLUTE PLAYING SINCE IT SOUNDED AWFUL BECAUSE OF THE ODD SHAPE OF HIS MOUTH
BUT THEY FINALLY DECIDED TO LIKE IT BECAUSE IT KEPT THE FLIES AWAY AND THAT WAS A LOT BETTER THEN HAVING LOTS OF FLIES CRAWLING ON THEM
SIL
I'M GOING TO TELL YOU ABOUT ROOSTER JOHN BUT I'LL HAVE TO START FIRST WITH THE TOWN OF FRANKSVILLE
IN FRANKSVILLE THEY JUST DIDN'T SEEM TO STOP HAVING PROBLEMS THE FIRST PROBLEM WAS WATER
THEY RAN OUT OF WATER LUCKILY SOMEONE FOUND DUG A HOLE IN THE GROUND AND FOUND WATER
THEN FLIES CAME MILLIONS OF FLIES

SIL
THE PEOPLE EVERYONE TRIED TO MAKE JOHN STOP FLUTES STOP PLAYING THE FLUTE
POLICE CHIEF SANDERS EVEN THREW HIM IN JAIL BUT HE HAD TO LET HIM GO SINCE HE WASN'T SINCE JOHN WASN'T ACTUALLY BREAKING A LAW
SIL
BUT THEN A SCIENTIST NAMED DOCTOR WONG
DISCOVERED UH HOW TO MAKE A MOUTH MOUTH PIECE FOR JOHN THAT WOULD MAKE HIS FLUTE SOUND NORMAL
SO HE PLAYED THE FLUTE RATHER WELL
BUT THE FLIES CAME BACK
SIL
THEN HIS N HE SMASHED HIS NEW FLUTE ON THE WALL TRYING TO SWAT A FLY SO HE GOT HIS OLD ONE OUT AND PLAYED IT BUT IT DIDN'T HAVE THE SPECIAL MOUTHPIECE SO
SIL
SO IT SOUNDED AWFUL EVERYONE HAD TO COVER THEIR EARS

SIL
ROOSTER JOHN
SIL
BEFORE I TELL YOU HOW ROOSTER JOHN GOT HIS NAME YOU SHOULD KNOW A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE TOWN OF F FRANKSVILLE
SIL
<br> FRANKSVILLE WAS A TOWN THAT SEEMED TO HAVE ONE PROBLEM AFTER THE OTHER
SIL
THEIR PROBLEMS STARTED WHEN
THEY RAN OUT OF WATER THANKFULLY SOMEONE WAS DIGGING A HOLE AND FOUND WATER
SIL
BUT
SOON AFTER THEY STARTED GETTING FLIES
SIL
THEY GOT TONS AND TONS OF FLIES
SIL
THEN THE FLIES STOPPED
SIL
BUT JUST THEN A MAN MOVED IN TOW
TO TOWN WHO PLAYED THE FLUTE SO BADLY THAT PEOPLE WOULD RUN AWAY SCREAMING
WHY OH WHY DID
SIL
THEY EVER INVENT EARS
<br> MAYBE A POORLY PLAYED FLUTE DOESN'T SOUND ALL THAT BAD
BUT JUST TRY TO IMAGINE SOMEONE SCRATCHING A CHALKBOARD WITH A FORK
SIL
THEN MULTIPLY THAT B TIMES A HUNDRED
SIL
THAT'S HOW THE FLUTE SOUNDED WHEN THIS GUY PLAYED IT
FLIES I SUPPOSE
<br>
THE BAD
SIL
BAD FLUTE PLAYER WAS ROOSTER JOHN
SIL
HE WASN'T CALLED ROOSTER JOHN YET
BUT
SIL
THAT CAME LATER
SIL
HE WAS SIL THE NEW TOWN DENTIST HE WAS A VERY EXCELLENT
DE
DENTIST BUT HIS REAL LOVE WAS MUSIC
SIL
HE PLAYED MA
MANY MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS SUCH AS THE GUITAR TUBA THE PIANO
AND THE CLARINET
<br> BUT FOR SOME REASON
SIL
THE WAY HIS MOUTH
WAS SHAPED MADE THE FLUTE SOUND SO BAD
<br> THAT HIS FISH WOULD JUMP AT OF THEIR FISH BOWL
SIL
WE CAN'T LET YOU PLAY THE FLUTE ANYMORE JOHN SAID THE POLI
SAID POLICE CHIEF SANDERS
THE NEIGHBORS ARE COMPLAINING AND THE CATS AND DOGS ARE TRYING TO CHEW OFF THEIR EARS
SIL
BUT I HAVE TO PLAY I WAS BORN TO DO IT
I DON'T KNOW WHY BUT I FEEL LIKE
SIL
I HAVE TO OR ELSE
SIL
BAD THINGS WILL HAPPEN
LOOK JOHN I'VE HEARD YOU PLAY THE CLARINET YOU'RE QUITE GOOD
WHY DON'T YOU PLAY THAT INSTEAD
SIL
SAID POLICE
SIL
CHIEF SANDERS
SIL
OH THAT'S A NICE INSTRUMENT BUT IT'S NOT THE FLUTE
SIL
I WROTE A SONG F
ON THE FLUTE IT'S CALLED COPS AND ROBBERS
HE PLAY SIL THE SONG FOR POLICE CHIEF SANDER
SIL
THE POLICE CHIEF HATED THE SOUND SO MUCH THAT HE THREW JOHN IN JAIL
SIL
BUT THEY COULDN'T KEEP JOHN IN JAIL SINCE
SIL
THE
SIL
HE <unk> WASN'T REALLY BREAKING ANY LAWS
<br> SO THERE WAS NOTHING
SIL
THAT THE POLICE COULD DO
BESIDES EVERYBODY LOVED JOHN
SINCE HE HAD
COME TO TO BE THE TOWN'S
SIL
DENTIST EVERYBODY'S TEETH WERE SO MUCH WHITER AND CLEANER
SIL
AND NO ONE HAD ANY CAVITIES
SIL
SO THERE WAS NO
SIL
W WAS A PROBLEM IN THE LITTLE TOWN OF FRANKSVILLE
SIL
WHAT SHOULD THEY DO
THEY COULDN'T KEEP JOHN IN JAIL
AND THEY DIDN'T WANT TO KICK HIM OUT OF TOWN BECAUSE THEY ALL HAD SUCH NICE TEETH
<br> SO THEY DECIDED THAT JOHN COULD PLAY THE FLUTE
SIL
UHM AND EVERYBODY ELSE WOULD HAVE TO WEAR EARPLUGS
SIL
WELL I'M SURE YOU GUESSED THAT DIDN'T WORK
SIL
NO ONE COULD HEAR ANYTHING
SIL
PEOPLE WERE GETTING INTO CAR ACCIDENTS AND EVERYBODY LOOKED REALLY SILLY A
AT DANCES DANCING TO MUSIC TH
THEY COULDN'T HEAR
SIL
THEY JUST COULDN'T LEAD A NORMAL LIFE
SIL
THEN THEY DECIDED TO LOWER HIM DOWN A WELL AND LET HIM PLAY DOWN THERE
SIL
N WHERE NO ONE COULD HEAR HIM
SIL
JOHN THOUGHT THAT WAS AN OKAY IDEA BUT THERE WAS
SIL
AN ECHO IN THE WELL THAT MADE THE FLUTE SOUND LOUDER
WINDOWS WERE BREAKING AND ALL THE COWS IN TOWN
STARTED TO MAKE SOUR MILK
SIL
THE LOCAL SCIENTIST DOCTOR WONG CAME UP WITH AN IDEA
SIL
HE THOUGHT IF TH
IF HE MADE A NEW MOUTHPIECE ESPECIALLY SHAPED
FOR JOHN'S MOUTH THEN PERHAPS HE COULD PLAY THE FLUTE NORMALLY
<br> AND GUESS WHAT IT WORKED
DOCTOR WONG WAS THE TOWN HERO
THE FLUTE SOUNDED NORMAL AND IT TURNED OUT THAT JOHN COULD PLAY QUI
PLAY IT QUITE WELL
<br> THE PEOPLE IN T
THE TOWN DECIDED TO HAVE A GREAT BIG PARADE
SIL
IN FRANKSVILLE
TO CELEBRATE THE <unk> THAT FOR ONCE THERE WAS NO
WATER PROBLEM NO FLY PROBLEM AND NO FLUTE PROBLEM
DOCTOR WONG AND JOHN WERE THE STARS OF THE PARADE
SIL
THEY WERE ON THE MAIN FLOAT
A BIG BAND PLAYED AS THEY MARCHED
SIL
UP AND DOWN MAIN STREET
EVERYBODY CHEERED
SIL
THEN SUDDENLY A FLY
SIL
LANDED ON A LITTLE GIRL THEN ANOTHER ONE ON A BIG GIRL
SIL
THEN
SIL
ONE LANDED ON EVERYONE
SIL
THEN TWO LANDED ON EVERYONE
SIL
PRETTY THEN PRETTY SOON TONS OF FLIES WERE LANDING ON EVERYONE
SIL
BEFORE THEY KNEW IT THE TOWN WAS FILLED WITH FLIES AGAIN
SIL
OH NO SAID POLICE CHIEF SANDERS
SIL
JUST WHEN THINGS WERE GOING GOOD FOR FRANKSVILLE
SIL
JOHN DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO
SIL
SO HE JUST KEPT ON PLAYING HIS FLUTE
THE FLIES WERE ANNOYING SO HE CO
SIL
WOULD SWAT THEM WITH HIS HAND
<br> AND EVEN HIS NEW FLUTE
<br> HE STARTED SHAKING THE FLUTE TO GET THE FLIES OFF
AND ACCIDENTALLY SMASHED IT INTO PIECES
HE WAS VERY UPSET AT FIRST THEN
SIL
OH WELL <unk> GOOD THING I BROUGHT A
MY OLD FLUTE
AS BACK UP
NO NO PLEASE DON'T PLAY YOUR OLD FLUTE D
BEGGED DOCTOR WONG
SIL
JOHN HAD STARTED PLAYING
WHEN THE TOWNSFOLKS HEARD THE NOISE THEY <unk>
COULDN'T EVEN SWAT AT THE FLIES ANYMORE THEY HAD TO COVER THEIR EARS FROM THE HORRIBLE SOUND
<br> THE FLIES WOULD LAND ALL OVER THE PEOPLE
SIL
<unk>
SIL
THAT COULDN'T SWAT THEM OFF
IT WAS GROSS THEN SUDDENLY THE FLIES FLEW AWAY FAST AS THEY COULD
<br> DOCTOR WONG FOR A SECOND
THEN PRONOUNCED IT'S THE FLUTE SOUND
SIL
THE FLIES HATE JOHN'S FLUTE PLAYING AS MUCH AS WE DO JOHN D
THE DENTIST IS DRIVING THE FLIES AWAY
SIL
IT WAS THEN THAT THE PEOPLE OF FRANKSVILLE REALIZED THAT IT
SIL
THEY WOULD HAVE TO TAKE
SIL
THE GOOD WITH THE BAD
<br> BECAUSE AS THE BAD AS
AS BAD AS THE FLUTE SOUNDED
IT WAS A LOT BETTER THAN THOUSANDS OF FLIES CLA CRAWLING ON THEM
SIL
FROM THEN ON JOHN WOULD WAKE UP AT SUNRISE LIKE A ROOSTER
AND PLAY TO KEEP THE FLIES AWAY
WELL IN ROOSTER JOHN
SIL
IT WAS A TOWN THAT HAD LOTS OF PROBLEMS
AND SO ONE OF THEIR PROBLEMS WAS A A PERSON WHO COULDN'T PLAY THE FLUTE VERY WELL
<br> SIL
AND SO THEY MADE HIM S HE THEY MADE HIM A FLUTE THAT HE COULD PLAY WELL
SIL
AND UHM THEN ONE OF THEIR OLD PROBLEMS GAVE BACK AND THAT WAS LOTS OF FLIES
AND UHM
SIL
SO TH AND THEN HE BROKE HIS NEW FLUTE THAT WORKED FOR HIM
AND SO HE HAD TO PLAY HIS OLD FLUTE AND IT DROVE THE FLIES AWAY
SIL
UHM THEY TRIED THROWING HIM IN JAIL UHM AND THEY ALSO TRIED
SIL
EARPLUGS AND THEY ALSO TRIED PUTTING HIM IN A WELL
SIL
AND THEN THEY TRIED A NEW MOUTHPIECE FOR THE FLUTE
AND STILL SHE SAT AND STILL SHE REELED AND STILL SHE WISHED FOR COMPANY

AYE I KNOW SAID THE DAME GENTLY FEARING TO INTERRUPT THE STORY
YOU CERTAINLY ARE AN ABLE MINDED YOUNGSTER HIRAM HE OBSERVED
AFTER DINNER JORDAN CREPT UP BY W WAY OF THE BACK STAIRS TO SEE HER

THY SWORD CANNOT STAND AGAINST AN OAKEN STAFF SUCH AS MINE
FOR YOU NEVER KNEW EXACTLY WHAT THIS MAN MIGHT SAY OR DO

HE TILED HE TILTED HIS HAT BRIM TO SHADE HIS FACE AND LOOKED FOR HIS CHICKENS
NAN RECEIVED A SEWING MACHINE TO REMIND HER OFF THE REMIND HER OFF THE FRESH AIR WORK
THE POOR PERSECUTED <unk> COUNTRY PEOPLE BELIEVED THAT THE NEW FOREST WAS ENCHANTED
YOUR LORDSHIP IS GREATLY TO BE CONGRATULATED HE SAID WARMLY
IF I WERE AS BIG AS YOU ARE JIM I'D FIGHT THESE MISERABLE TURNIP ROOTS
IT WAS THAT DAY WHEN YOU GOT YOUR TOE POUNDED ADDED DAVIE LOOKING AT JOEL
WE ALL LOOKED AT EACH OTHER TRYING TO GLEAN SOMETHING EACH <unk> FROM THE OTHER
DIANA SHOOK HER HEAD GLEEFULLY HER BLACK EYES DANCING WITH MERRIMENT
THEN HE PULLED THE HOOD OFF HIS CLOAK OVER HIS EARS AND OVER HIS BROW
WHICH OF YOU BOYS PLACED THIS STONE SIGNAL ASKED THE YOUNG EXPLORER
THEY SHOOK THE FLOUR OFF HER AND SET HER DOWN ON THE KITCHEN FLOOR
I BEG YOUR PARDON SAID THE LEARNED MAN IT IS AN OLD HABIT WITH ME
SHE SAW THAT SHE WAS ON THE GRASS AND THE BROKEN WHEEL BESIDE HER
SIL
SIL
THE AIRPLANE RIDE
SIL
THE FIRST TIME I EVER TOOK AN AIRPLANE RIDE
SIL
BY MYSELF
IT WAS FUN AND SCARY
SIL
I DIDN'T KNOW ANYONE AT ALL AND HAD TO GO ALL THE WAY
FROM NEW YORK TO TEXAS WITHOUT MY PARENTS
I WAS GOING THERE TO SEE MY GRANDFATHER
SIL
WE WERE GOING TO GO FISHING
SIL
I ALWAYS I'VE ALWAYS THOUGHT FLYING WAS FUN
SIL
YOU GO HIGHER THAN ANY MOUNTAIN AND YOU GO FASTER THAN ANY CAR
SIL
BUT YOU
BUT TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH
SIL
WITHOUT MY PARENTS THERE I WAS PRETTY NERVOUS
I GUESS IT WAS BECAUSE THE PLANE WAS SO LOUD AND I DIDN'T KNOW ANYONE
SIL
I STARTED THINKING WE MIGHT CRASH
I DIDN'T LIKE TO THINK ABOUT THAT BUT
SIL
I COULDN'T HELP IT
SIL
THAT'S WHEN I MISSED MY PARENTS THE MOST
SIL
ONCE THE PLANE WAS IN THE AIR I WAS PRETTY GOOD
SIL
MY MOM GAVE ME A COLORING BOOK OF COOL LOOKING DRAGONS TO KEEP ME BUSY
SIL
I COLORED THE DRAGON
PICTURES ALL GREEN SO IT DIDN'T TAKE VERY LONG
SIL
I ONLY USED THE GREEN CRAYON BECAUSE IT WAS THE TALLEST AND I WANTED
SIL
IT TO CATCH UP TO THE RED
BROWN BLUE YELLOW
PURPLE AND BLACK ONES
SIL
ONE THING
SIL
BEING
ABOUT BEING BY YOURSELF ON AN AIRPLANE IS THAT THE FLIGHT ATTENDANTS ARE VERY NICE TO YOU
SIL
I HAD SEVEN COLA'S AND FOUR GINGER ALE'S
SIL
WHICH MADE ME <unk> HAVE TO GO TO THE BATHROOM EIGHT TIMES
I WAS GLAD THAT THERE WASN'T ANYONE NEXT TO ME
THE PERSON NEXT TO ME WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY ANNOYED
SIL
EVEN THE FLIGHT ATTENDANT SEEMED A LITTLE ANNOYED THAT I HAD TO GO TO THE BATHROOM SO MUCH
BUT IT WAS HER FAULT
FOR SOME REASONS SHE KEPT TRYING TO GIVE ME SIL PEANUTS
BUT I TOLD HER THAT <unk> I WOULD LIKE A BANANA SPLIT INSTEAD
SHE SAID THEY DON'T HAVE ANY BANANA SPLITS ON A
THE PLANE
BUT SOMETIMES PEOPLE LIKE TO EAT
SIL
PEANUTS ON THEIR BANANA SPLITS
SIL
I DON'T
SIL
I TOLD HER THAT IT WAS THE PEANUTS THAT WERE MAKING ME SO THIRSTY
SIL
IN THE FIRST PLACE AND THAT IF SHE WOULD
SIL
GET ME A BANANA SPLIT I WOULDN'T HAVE TO GO THE BATHROOM SO MUCH
SIL
SHE TOLD ME
TO BE QUIET AND WATCH THE MOVIE I TRIED TO WATCH THE MOVIE BUT I HAD ALREADY SEEN THAT ONE SO IT WAS BORING
SIL
THE FLIGHT ATTENDANT GAVE ME A DECK OF CARDS BUT SHE WOULDN'T PLAY GO FISH WITH ME
SIL
SHE S SAID THAT SHE HAD
TO HELP OTHER PASSENGERS
SIL
I HAD A GAME BOY IN MY BACKPACK
MY BACKPACK WAS IN THE OVERHEAD THINGY
SIL
I TRIED TO PUSH THE BUTTON THAT LIGHTS UP SO THE
FLIGHT ATTENDANT WOULD COME
BUT GUESS WHAT
IT WAS TOO SHORT TO REACH THE BUTTON
I WAS TOO SHORT TO REACH THE BUTTON
SIL
SO
SIL
I
STARTED YELLING HEY PEANUT LADY HEY PEANUT LADY
SIL
SHE DIDN'T LIKE BEING CALLED PEANUT LADY BUT SHE DID
SIL
GET ME MY GAME BOY
SHE TOLD ME TO CALL HER JENNIFER INSTEAD
I PLAYED ON MY GAME BOY UNTIL I GOT MY NEW HIGH SCORE
THEN JENNIFER GA
CAME UP TO ME
AND SAID SHE HAD A SURPRISE
I THOUGHT GREAT MORE PEANUTS
SIL
BUT IT SIL WASN'T PEANUTS
SIL
IT WAS SOMETHING REALLY COOL SHE SAID THE CAPTAIN WAS
INVITING ME TO SEE THE COCKPIT
SIL
I THOUGHT AWESOME
SIL
I ALSO BROUGHT MY DECK OF CARDS IN CASE THE PILOT WAS
BORED AND WANTED TO PLAY
SIL
GO FISH
SIL
JENNIFER TOOK ME INTO THE COCKPIT AND THERE WERE LIKE A MILLION BUTTONS AND
SIL
LEVERS AND KNOBS AND STUFF
SIL
SUDDENLY I THOUGHT WOW LOOK AT ALL THOSE BUTTONS
SIL
THEN I THOUGHT THERE'S NO WAY THAT ANYONE CAN REMEMBER TO PUSH ALL THOSE BUTTONS AT THE RIGHT TIME
SIL
WE ARE GOING TO CRASH
SIL
THE WAY I FIGURED IT MY GAME BOY ONLY
HAS FIVE BUTTONS AND I CAN'T GET PAST
THREE
LEVEL THREE
IMAGINE HOW HARD IT WOULD BE TO WORK
ALL THOSE MILLIONS OF BUTTONS
AND EAT PEANUTS AND GO TO THE BATHROOM
THE PILOT TOLD ME
SIL
THAT IT WAS
IT WASN'T REALLY THAT HARD ONCE YOU PRACTICED
SIL
THEN HE TOLD ME THAT
SIL
HE ONCE PLAYED THE GAME I HAD ON MY GAME BOY
AND HE COULDN'T EVEN PASS LEVEL ONE
SIL
I SAID IF YOU CAN'T GET PAST LEVEL ONE AND YOU CAN BE A PILOT THEN I
COULD BE A PILOT TOO SINCE I'M MUCH BETTER
AT PUSHING BUTTONS THAN YOU ARE
SIL
HE LAUGHED
SIL
EVEN THOUGH I WASN'T JOKING HE
SIL
SAID HE THOUGHT I WOULD MAKE A GREAT PILOT SOMEDAY IF I W WANTED TO BE
<unk>
HE WAS REALLY NICE BUT HE WOULDN'T PLAY GO FISH WITH ME
FINALLY WE LANDED
SIL
THAT'S ALWAYS SCARY BECAUSE IT SEEMS LIKE EVEN THOUGH WE ARE
ON THE GROUND
THAT THE PLANE IS GOING TOO FAST
TO EVER STOP
BUT IT DID
SIL
WHEN I GOT OFF THE AIRPLANE
THERE WAS GRANDPA WAITING FOR ME
HE SAID HOW WAS YOUR FLIGHT
AND
AND I SAID SOMEDAY I'M GOING TO BE A PILOT
AND I'LL ONLY SERVE BANANA SPLITS ON MY PLANE
SIL
GRANDPA LAUGHED AND THEN
TOOK ME STRAIGHT TO THE
ICE CREAM SHOP
IT WAS WORTH THE WHOLE TRIP JUST TO EAT A BANANA SPLIT WITH GRANDPA
WELL UHM
SIL
HE WENT ON THE AIRPLANE AND UHM HE WAS GOING TO SEE HIS GRANDPA AND HE UHM
SIL
HE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO EXPECT EXPECT BECAUSE HE UHM
WASN'T WITH HIS PARENTS ON THE PLANE AND UHM THE FLIGHT ATTENDANT KEPT GIVING HIM PEANUTS AND UHM COKE AND SO HE HAD TO GO TO THE BATHROOM A LOT
AND UHM THAT ANNOYED THE FLIGHT ATTENDANT AND THEN UHM SHE TOOK HIM UP TO SEE THE PILOT IN THE FRONT
AND UHM HE WAS SCARED THAT THEY WERE GOING TO CRASH BECAUSE HE DIDN'T THINK THE PILOT COULD CONTROL ALL THE BUTTONS
SIL
AND UHM
THEN THEY LANDED AND HE
SAW HIS GRANDPA AND THEY WENT TO GET A BANANA SPILT TOGETHER
SIL
WELL HE UHM TRIED TO PLAY A GAME WITH CARDS
HE PLAY HIS GAME BOY AND UHM HE WENT TO THE BATHROOM
THE RED LEAVES WERE BLOWN AROUND IN MILLIONS BY THE WIND
BEHIND LAY THE SHIP A PICTURE <unk> NOT A PICTURE NOT WITHOUT ITS LIGHTER SIDE
AND MEANWHILE BY THE FUR FURTHER RIVER BANK CAME ROSALIND WITH MUSHROOMS IN HER SKIRT
NOW GO AND ANSWER YOUR NOTES AND LET ME FINISH THIS SPLENDID STORY
MORE COURAGE THAN MY POOR BROTHER WHO STANDS THERE LIKE A COWARD
SHE RUSHED FRANTICALLY ACROSS THE APARTMENT SEIZED HER HOOD AND RAN FROM THE COTTAGE
THEY CARRY THEMSELVES AS IF THEY HAD BEEN DRILLED BOTH MEN AND WOMEN
I FEAR THAT WE SHALL HAVE ANOTHER SMART GALE HOWEVER IT WON'T LAST LONG
OF COURSE THERE'S NOTHING VERY INTI ENTERTAINING HERE FOR YOU
THE DAY ETHEL BROWN WAS SEVEN YEARS OLD SHE HAD A TEA PARTY
THE YOUNGSTER LINGERED FOR A MOMENT OR TWO WATCHING MYLES AT HIS WORK
THESE WORDS CRIED DESTROYED THE HOPE THAT OF A LATE HAD BEEN GROWING WITHIN HER
ITS FLAVOR WHEN COOKED IS MORE EXQUISITE FAR THAN MUTTON OR OYSTERS OR EGGS
I'M IN I'M IN EARNEST HUCK JUST AS EARNEST AS EVER I WAS IN MY LIFE
HUMOR AND PATHOS <unk> MAKE IT ALIVE AND YOU HAVE FOUND YOUR STYLE AT LAST
THE SEAGRAVE KNELT BY HIS SIDE TOOK HIS HAND AND BURST INTO TEARS
NAN SAID IT WOULDN'T GROW IN OUR GARDEN BUT I BROUGHT SOME HOME TO TRY IT
HIS BOOTS CREAKED TOO SO LOUDLY BUT STILL HE WAS NOT AT ALL AFRAID
SHE WILL BE GLAD TO SEE YOU BUT SHE HAS BEEN VERY BADLY FRIGHTENED
HE TURNED HIS BACK ON THE BOY AND CONFERRED ASIDE WITH LAWRENCE
I DESIRE IT SO MUCH THAT I WILL TAKE NO REFUSAL
AND THE PRIZE CUP GREW CLEARER AND NEARER TO HER MENTAL VISION
SIL
THE SLOWEST TURTLE
EVERY FOUR YEARS TURTLE FROM ALL OVER THE LAND WOULD C WOULD CRAWL TO GREAT POND
IT WOULD TAKE SOME TURTLES FROM FAR AWAY VILLAGES T TWO WHOLE WEEKS JUST TO GET THERE
WHEN ALL TURTLES ARRIVED THERE
SIL
TURTLES COULD CATCH UP WITH FRIENDS THEY HAD NOT SEEN SINCE THE LAST FESTIVAL
EVERYTHING ABOUT THE FESTIVAL WAS FUN BUT THE MAIN EVENT WAS THE GREAT TURTLE RACE
THE WINNER OF THE GREAT TURTLE RACE WAS SO IMPORTANT THAT THE WINNER DIDN'T HAVE TO MOVE FOR FOUR YEARS UNTIL THE NEXT FESTIVAL
SIL
THE LESS A TURTLE MOVES THE BIGGER THEY GET AND THE LONGER THEY LIVE
SO YOU CAN SEE THE WINNING SO YOU CAN SEE WINNING THE GREAT RACE IS A GREAT HONOR
THE TURTLE CUP WAS THE TROPHY THAT THE WINNER COULD TAKE HOME TO THEIR VILLAGE
THE TURTLE CUP WAS IN A SLUDGE WAS IN SLUDGE POND FOR OVER FIFTY YEARS THAT'S BECAUSE NO ONE COULD EVER BEAT THE TURTLE FROM THERE
SIL
HE WAS THE SLOWEST TURTLE OF ALL TIME
IMAGINE HE HADN'T HE HADN'T HAD TO MOVE FOR OVER FIFTY YEARS
<br> HE WAS THE BIGGEST MOST RESPECTED AND ONE OF THE TRICKIEST TURTLES IN HISTORY
THERE WAS THERE WERE MANY LEGENDS ABOUT HIM IT WAS RUMORED HE WAS SO SLOW HIS HEART WOULD ONLY B WOULD ONLY BEAT ONCE A DAY
HIS NAME WAS MUD AND HE WAS THE GREATEST CHAMPION IN THE HISTORY OF THE SH SHELL DWELLERS FESTIVAL HE WAS UNBEATABLE
WHEN MUD WAS IN HIS PRIME THERE WAS A NEW TURTLE BORN IN BLUE POND
THIS TURTLE'S WAS NAMED SWISH
WHEN SWISH WAS BORN EVERYONE THOUGHT HE WAS A LITTLE SLOW BUT AS HE GOT A OLDER THE TURTLES BEGAN TO REALIZE THAT SWISH WAS REALLY REALLY REALLY SLOW
ONCE HIS MOTHER CALLED HIM FOR DINNER HE DIDN'T MAKE IT HOME UNTIL BREAKFAST THE NEXT MORNING AND HE WAS ONLY A FOOT AWAY
BLUE POND WAS LOCATED ABOUT THREE DAYS CRAWL FROM GREAT POND
MOSTLY NICE TURTLES
SIL
LIVE IN BLUE POND
BUT THEY ALL FELT A LITTLE SAD BECAUSE THEY HADN'T HELD THE TURTLE CUP IN OVER SEVEN HUNDRED YEARS
SO WITH SWISH THEY THOUGHT MAYBE JUST MAYBE HE COULD BRING BACK THE TURTLE CUP
EVERYONE TREATED SWISH DIFFERENTLY
FOR EXAMPLE MISTER PEEKS THE LOCAL SHELL CLEANER WOULD SAY HEY THERE SWISH DO YOU WANT A FREE SHELL WAXING TODAY
HE WE ALL WANT YOU TO LOOK GOOD F WHEN YOU BRING HOME THE CUP
SIL
MRS SNAPPER WOULD SAY HI SWISHY DO YOU WANT SOME YUMMY PIE TO FILL YOU UP AND SLOW YOU DOWN FOR THE BIG RACE A FAT TURTLE IS A SLOW TURTLE
MRS SNAPPER WAS NEVER NICE TO ANYONE BUT HE WAS BUT HE WAS BEING NICE TO SWISH
MISTER PEEKS WOULD NEVER DO ANYTHING FOR FREE BUT HE WAS GIVING SWISH A FREE SHELL WAXING
AND THE EXTRA ATTENTION MADE SWISH VERY UNCOMFORTABLE
SURE THEY ARE NICE TO ME NOW BECAUSE THEY THINK I CAN WIN THE RACE BUT IF I LOSE THEY'LL BE DISAPPOINTED AND MAD AT ME
I NEVER PROMISED THAT I WOULD WIN THE RACE I CAN'T BEAT MUD ANYWAY I HEARD ONCE IT TOOK HIM THREE DAYS JUST TO YAWN
SO ONE DAY HE TOLD HIS PARENTS I DON'T WANT TO RACE
ALL THE TURTLES IN BLUE POND HELD A MEETING TO DISCUSS THE PROBLEM
THE MAYOR DOCTOR SOFTSHELL SAID THIS IS RIDICULOUS SWISH HAS TO RACE <unk> HE'S THE SLOWEST TURTLE I'VE EVERY SEEN
SIL
UHM EXCEPT FOR MUD OF COURSE BUT WITHOUT HIM WE DON'T HAVE A CHANCE
SIL
BUT HE DOESN'T WANT TO BE TREATED SPECIAL HE JUST WANTS TO BE NORMAL AND HE DOESN'T WANT EVERYBODY TO HATE HIM IF HE CAN'T BEAT MUD
SIL
YOU HAVE TO
SIL
REMEMBER THAT EVEN THOUGH HE'S GIFTED AT BEING SLOW HE'S STILL VERY YOUNG SAID SWISH'S FATHER
WE NEVER THOUGHT OF THAT THEY AGREED
THEN THE TOWN PROMISED TO TREAT SWISH LIKE A NORMAL TURTLE AND AFTER A WHILE SWISH DECIDED THAT HE WOULD BE PROUD TO RACE FOR HIS VILLAGE
WHEN THE TIME OF THE FESTIVAL DREW NEAR ALL THE TURTLES ALL OVER THE LAND STARTED THEIR CRAWL TOWARD GREAT POND
SWISH HAD TO BE CARRIED ON HIS FATHER'S BACK SINCE IT WOULD HAVE TAKEN HIM YEARS TO GET TO GREAT POND BY HIMSELF
FINALLY AFTER THE LONG JOURNEY ALL THE TURTLES ARRIVED AT GREAT POND
THIS WAS SWISH'S FIRST EVER SHELL DWELLERS FESTIVAL HE THOUGHT IT WAS THE MOST WONDERFUL THING HE EVER SAW
THERE WERE THOUSANDS OF TURTLES OF MANY DIFFERENT SPECIES ALL HAVING A GREAT TIME
LOOK THERE'S YOUR COUSIN PEEK A BOO FROM BIG PUDDLE VILLAGE SAID SWISH'S MOTHER YOU'LL GET TO MEET ALL SORTS OF NEW TURTLES
SWISH WAS SUDDENLY VERY EXCITED HE TOLD HIS MOM
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M GOING TO WIN THIS RACE I KNOW IT AND ALL THESE TURTLES WILL KNOW THAT BLUE POND RULES IM NOT AFRAID OF MUD
SWISH'S MOM SMILED AND SAID
I KNOW THAT YOU CAN WIN SWISH BUT WE'LL BE PROUD OF YOU EVEN IF YOU DON'T WIN IT'S AN HONOR JUST TO GET TO RACE SAID SWISH'S MOM
SWISH SAW A BIG ROCK IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FESTIVAL AND WONDERED ABOUT IT
HOW COME THEY DON'T MOVE THAT BIG ROCK OUT OF THE MIDDLE OF THE FIELD IT SEEMS TO BE IN EVERYONE'S WAY SAID SWISH
THAT'S NOT A ROCK SWEETIE SAID HIS MOM <unk> THAT'S MUD
SWISH MADE A LOUD GULP SOUND
SWISHES FATHER SAID SON DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT YOU KNOW MY GRANDFATHER RACED MUD ONCE
HE WASN'T AS SLOW AS YOU BUT HE DID TEACH ME A THING OR TWO
<unk> THEN HE TOLD SWISH ALL OF MUD'S DIRTY TRICKS SO THAT SWISH WOULD BE READY FOR THEM
AFTER SEVEN DAYS OF PLAYING AND DANCING AND BUG EATING FINALLY THE DAY OF THE RACE CAME
THE MAYOR OF GREAT POND MRS TORT PASSED THE RULES OF THE RACE FOR EVERYONE TO SEE
THE RULES WERE NAILED TO THE TREE FOR ALL TO SEE
THEY READ RULE NUMBER ONE THE GREAT RACE BEGINS AT SUNRISE AND ENDS AT SUNSET
RULE NUMBER TWO ALL TURTLES MUST RUN AS FAST AS THEY CAN AND THE TURTLE THAT IS CLOSEST TO THE STARTING LINE WINS
SIL
RULE NUMBER THREE NO TURTLE MAY PRETEND TO BE GOING AS FAST AS THEY CAN BUT GO SLOW INSTEAD
ALL TURTLE MUST GO AS FAST AS THEY CAN AT ALL TIMES SINCE TURTLES NEVER CHEAT THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT RULE
TO BREAK THIS RULE WOULD MEAN AN END TO THE GREAT TURTLE RACE FOREVER
RULE NUMBER FOUR NO TURTLE MAY FALL ASLEEP SINCE IF YOU ARE ASLEEP YOU AREN'T RUNNING AS FAST AS YOU CAN
SWISH ALREADY
SIL
SWISH READ THE RULES EVEN THOUGH HE KNEW THEM BY HEART
THEN HE HEARD THE MAYOR SAY RUNNERS PLEASE TAKE YOUR POSITIONS
THE SLOWEST TURTLES FROM EACH POND WERE CARRIED TO THE STARTING LINE BY MEMBERS OF THEIR VILLAGES
THERE WERE ABOUT THREE HUNDRED TURTLES RACING
THE TURTLES STRETCHED AND THOUGHT REALLY SLOW THOUGHTS AS THEY AS THEY DID THE SKY TURNED FROM BLACK TO DARK BLUE
THEY LOOKED AT THE HORIZON AND SAW THE SUN WAS STARTING THE RISE
JUST THEN THE MAYOR SAID READY SET SLOW AND OFF THEY WENT
<unk> ALL THE TURTLES WERE VERY VERY SLOW
SO IT TOOK SOME TIME BEFORE ANYONE COULD FIGURE OUT WHICH TURTLES WERE THE SLOWEST
BUT AFTER A FEW HOURS MOST OF THE TURTLES HAD GONE A FEW FEET ALL EXCEPT TWO
SIL
SWISH AND MUD WERE BOTH BACK AT THE STARTING LINE IT LOOKED AS IF NEITHER OF THEM HAD MOVED AT ALL
THEY WERE BOTH MOVING OF COURSE BUT THEY WERE SO SLOW IT WAS HARD TO TELL
AFTER SIX HOURS MUD AND SWISH WERE STILL TIED AND HAD ONLY MOVED A FEW INCHES
BY NOW ALL THE TURTLES WERE WAY AHEAD OF MUD BUT THIS TIME SWISH WAS JUST AS SLOW
MUD KNEW THAT THIS WOULD BE HIS CLOSEST RACED EVER AND HE WAS ACTUALLY GETTING A LITTLE BIT SCARED OF THIS SWISH KID
WHO IS THIS YOUNG PUNK HE THOUGHT TO HIMSELF
SIL
MUD SAID TO SWISH THERE'S NO WAY THAT A TURTLE AS YOUNG AS YOU CAN BE SO SLOW
<br> EVEN I WAS FASTER THAN YOU WHEN I WAS YOUR AGE YOU'RE CHEATING YOU'RE GOING TO RUIN THE GREAT RACE FOREVER
BUT SWISH WOULDN'T LET MUD SCARE HIM
YOU'RE JUST TRYING TO MAKE ME QUIT I'M NOT GOING TO FALL FOR YOUR TRICKS HE SAID HE SAID TURTLES NEVER CHEAT AND I'M A TURTLE WITH HONOR
THEN MUD TRIED ANOTHER TRICK HE STARTED SINGING IN A SOFT BEAUTIFUL LULLABY SWISH STARTED YAWNING
HE WAS TIRED FROM RACING AND THOUGHT THAT IT WOULD BE NICE TO JUST LISTEN TO MUD'S SWEET VOICE AND FALL ASLEEP
THEN HE SNAPPED OUT OF IT AND REMEMBERED HIS FATHER TOLD HIM ABOUT THIS TRICK GAVE HIM EARPLUGS
SIL
HE PUT THE EARPLUGS IN HIS EARS AND COULDN'T HEAR MUD'S SINGING ANYMORE
MUD KEPT SINGING HIS LULLABY FOR A FEW HOURS BUT HE STOPPED RIGHT BEFORE SUNSET
THE CROWD THOUGHT HE MUST HAVE REALIZED THAT IT WASN'T WORKING
BUT THEN RIGHT AT THE END RIGHT BEFORE THE SUNSET
SIL
SWISH STARTED TO PULL AHEAD OF MUD
OH NO SHOUTED THE FANS MUD'S WINNING IT LOOKS LIKE MUD IS STILL THE GREATEST TURTLE OF THEM ALL
AND THEN WHEN THE SUN WENT DOWN MUD WAS THE CLOSEST TURTLE TO THE STARTING LINE
SWISH WAS SAD THAT HE LOST BUT ALL THE TURTLES FROM BLUE POND
SIL
CHEERED FOR SWISH
SIL
THEY WERE VERY PROUD HE GAVE MUD SUCH A CLOSE RACE
SWISH WAS JUST HAPPY TOO WAS JUST HAPPY TOO BUT DEEP DOWN INSIDE HE KNEW HE WAS JUST AS SLOW AS MUD
THE MAYOR OF PONDLAND WENT TO PRESENT TURTLE CUP TO SLUDGE POND AGAIN
<unk> SHE ANNOUNCED WELL MUD IT LOOKS LIKE YOU'VE DONE IT SLUDGE POND WINS THE TURTLE CUP AGAIN
THIS TIME IT WAS A BIT CLOSER THAN YOU WOULD HAVE LIKED I'LL BET
WHAT WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO SAY TO ALL THE TURTLES AT THE FESTIVAL
THE CROWD STARTED YELLING SPEECH SPEECH
MUD DIDN'T ANSWER
THE MAYOR TAPPED MUD ON THE SHELL AND SAID HELLO HELLO MUD
MUD STILL DIDN'T ANSWER IN FACT MUD WAS SOUND ASLEEP
MUD HAD ACTUALLY SUNG HIMSELF TO SLEEP
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN SAID MRS TROUT TORT
MUD FROM SLUDGE POND HAS BEEN DISQUALIFIED FOR SLEEPING DURING THE RACE
THIS MEANS THAT WE HAVE A NEW CHAMPION THE REAL WINNER IS SWISH SOFTBELLY AT BLUE POND THE CROWD WENT WILD
SIL
MS TORT WENT UP TO SWISH AND GAVE HIM THE TURTLE CUP
SHE SAID SWISH YOU ARE THE YOUNGEST WINNER OF THE GREAT TURTLE RACE THAT WAS THE MOST EXCITING FINISH WE'VE EVER HAD
I THINK THAT YOU WILL BE A GREAT CHAMPION FOR MANY YEARS SINCE ONLY TURTLES ONLY GET SLOWER WITH AGE
FOR THE FIRST TIME IN SIX HUNDRED YEARS I WOULD LIKE TO PRESENT THE TURTLE CUP TO BLUE POND THE CROWD WENT WILD AGAIN
SWISH TOOK THE CUP THAT DAY FOR THE FIRST TIME
HE WOULD TAKE IT MANY MORE TIMES AFTER THAT IT WAS BECAUSE OF SWISH THAT BLUE POND BECAME THE MOST RESPECTED POND IN THE LAND
HE WOULD NEVER LOSE THE TURTLE CUP FOR THE REST OF HIS LONG LIFE
BUT THOUGH HE BECAME THE GREATEST AND BIGGEST TURTLE OF ALL TIME
MUCH GREATER OR BIGGER THAN MUD HE ALWAYS MADE SURE THAT NO ONE TREATED HIM SPECIAL AND THAT HE TREATED EVERYBODY LIKE HE WANTED TO BE TREATED
LIKE A TURTLE WITH HONOR
ANOTHER TURTLE SHOWED HIM THAT CHEATING'S NOT THE MOST IMPORTANT THING AND WINNING ISN'T THE MOST IMPORTANT THING AND IT'S GOOD TO BE TREATED LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE
CAUSE EVEN THOUGH YOU'RE A WINNER YOU'RE STILL LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE
SIL

<br> THE AIRPLANE RIDE
THE FIRST TIME I EVER TOOK AN AIRPLANE BY MYSELF IT WAS FUN AND SCARY
I DIDN'T KNOW ANYONE AT ALL ALL AND HAD TO GO ALL THE WAY FROM NEW YORK TO TEXAS WITHOUT MY PARENTS
I WAS FLYING THERE TO SEE MY GRANDFATHER AND AND WE WERE GOING TO THE GO WE WERE GOING TO GO FISHING
I ALWAYS THOUGHT FLYING WAS FUN
YOU GO HIGHER AND THEN ANY MOUNTAIN HIGHER THAN ANY MOUNTAIN AND YOU GO FASTER THAN ANY CAR
BUT TO TELL YOUR THE BUT TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH WITHOUT MY PARENTS THERE I WAS PRETTY NERVOUS
I GUESS IT WAS BECAUSE THE PLANE WAS S SO LOUD AND I DIDN'T KNOW ANYONE
I STARTED THINKING HE MIGHT CRASH I DIDN'T LIKE TO THINK ABOUT THAT BUT I COULDN'T HELP IT
THAT'S WHEN I MISSED MY PARENTS THE MOST
SIL
BUT ONCE THE PLANE WAS IN THE CAR IN THE AIR I WAS PRETTY GOOD
<unk> MY MOM GAVE ME A COLORING BOOK AND A COOL LOOKING DRAGONS TO KEEP ME BUSY
A COL I COLORED THE DRAGON PICTURES ALL GREEN SO IT DIDN'T TAKE VERY LONG
I ONLY USED TO ONLY USED THE GREEN CRAYON BECAUSE IT WAS THE TALLEST AND I WANTED IT TO CATCH UP TO THE RED BROWN BLUE YELLOW PURPLE AND BLACK ONES
SIL
ONE THING ABOUT BEING BY YOURSELF ON AN AIRPLANE IS THAT THE FLIGHT ATTENDANTS ARE VERY NICE TO YOU
I HAD SEVEN COCA COL COLAS AND FOUR GINGER GINGER ALES
WHICH MADE ME HAVE TO GO TO THE BATHROOM EIGHT TIMES I WAS GLAD THAT THERE WASN'T ANYONE NEXT TO ME
THE PERSON NEXT TO ME WOULD BE WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY ANNOYED
SIL
UHM

SIL
EVENTUALLY THE FLIGHT FLIGHT ATTENDANT SEEMED TO GET A LITTLE ANNOYED THAT I HAD TO GO TO THE BATHROOM SO MUCH
BUT IT WAS HER FAULT
SHE WAS THE ONE WHO KEPT TRYING TO GIVE ME PEANUTS
SIL
I TOLD HER THAT I WANTED A BANANA SPLIT INSTEAD BUT SHE SAID THEY
SIL
THEY DON'T HAVE ANY BANANA SPLITS ON THE PLANE
BUT SOMETIMES PEOPLE LIKE TO EAT PEANUTS ON THEIR BANANA SPLITS
I TOLD HER THAT IT WAS THE PEANUTS THAT WERE MAKING ME SO THIRSTY IN THE FIRST PLACE IN THE FIRST PLACE AND THAT
SIL
AND THAT IF SHE WOULD GET ME A BANANA SPLIT I WOULDN'T I WOULDN'T HAVE TO GO THE BATHROOM SO MUCH
SHE TOLD ME TO BE QUIET AND WATCH THE MOVIE
I TRIED TO WATCH THE MOVIE BUT I HAD ALREADY SEEN THAT ONE SO IT WAS BORING
THE FLIGHT ATTENDANT GAVE ME A DECK OF CARDS BUT SHE WOULDN'T PLAY GO FISH WITH ME
<unk> SHE SAID THAT SHE HAD TO HELP OTHER PASSENGERS
I HAD A GAME BOY IN MY BACKPACK
BY MY BACKPACK WAS IN THE OVERHEAD THING THINGY
I TRIED TO PUSH THE BUTTON THAT LIGHTS UP OVER MY HEAD SO THE FLIGHT ATTENDANT WOULD COME BUT GUESS WHAT I WAS SO SHORT TO REACH THE BUTTON
SO I STARTED YELLING HEY PEANUT LADY HEY PEANUT LADY
SHE DIDN'T LIKE BEING CALLED PEANUT LADY BUT SHE DIDN'T GIVE ME MY GAME BOY
SHE TOLD ME TO CALL HER JENNIFER INSTEAD
I PLAYED ON MY GAME BOY UNTIL I GOT MY NEW HIGH SCORE
THEN JENNIFER CAME UP TO ME AND SAID SHE HAD A SURPRISE I THOUGHT GREAT I THOUGHT GREAT MORE PEANUTS
BUT IT WASN'T PEANUTS IT WAS SOMETHING REALLY COOL
SHE SAID THE CAPTAIN WAS INVITING ME TO SEE THE COCKPIT I THOUGHT AWESOME
I ALSO BROUGHT MY DECK OF CARDS IN CASE THE PILOT WAS BORED AND WANTED TO PLAY GO FISH
JENNIFER TOOK ME INTO THE COCKPIT AND THERE WERE A MILLION BUTTONS AND LEVERS AND KNOBS AND STUFF
AT FIRST I THOUGHT WOW LOOK AT ALL THOSE BUTTONS
THEN I THOUGHT THERE'S NO WAY THAT ANYONE CAN REMEMBER TO PUSH ALL THOSE BUTTONS AT THE RIGHT TIME
<br> WE ARE GOING TO CRASH
SIL
THE WAY I FIGURED IT MY GAME BOY MY GAME BOY ONLY WAS FIVE BUTTONS AND I
SIL
CAN'T GET PAST LEVEL THREE
IMAGINE HOW HARD IT WOULD BE TO WORK ALL THOSE MILLIONS OF BUTTONS AND EAT PEANUTS
THE PILOT TOLD ME THAT IT WASN'T REALLY THAT HARD ONCE YOU PRACTICED
<br> THEN HE TOLD ME THAT HE ONCE PLAYED THE GAME I HAD ON MY GAME BOY AND HE COULDN'T EVEN PASS LEVEL ONE
I SAID IF YOU CAN'T EVEN GET PAST LEVEL ONE AND YOU'RE A PILOT
THEN I COULD BE A PILOT TOO S PILOT TOO SINCE I'M MUCH BETTER AT PUSHING BUTTONS THAT YOU ARE PUSHING BUTTONS THAN YOU ARE
HE LAUGHED EVEN THOUGH I WAS JOKING HE SAID HE THOUGHT I WOULD MAKE A GREAT PILOT SOMEDAY IF I WANTED TO BE IF I WANTED TO BE
HE WAS READY REALLY NICE BUT HE WOULDN'T PLAY GO FISH WITH ME
FINALLY HE LANDED
SIL
THAT'S ALWAYS SCARY
IT SEEMED LIKE THE PLANE IN THE PLANE IS GOING
SIL
TOO FAST

TO EVER STOP BUT IT DOESN'T BUT IT DOES
WHEN I GOT OFF THE AIRPLANE THERE WERE WAS GRANDPA WAITING FOR ME HE SAID HOW WAS YOUR FLIGHT
I SAID SOMEDAY I'M GOING TO BE A PILOT AND I'LL ONLY SERVE BANANA SPLITS ON MY PLANE
GRANDPA LAUGHED AND TOLD AND TOOK ME STRAIGHT TO THE ICE CREAM SHOP

UHM IT WAS A DEEP DAZZLING LOVELY BLUE DEEPER THAN THE DEEPEST BLUE OF THE SKY
HE HAD GENTLE AND REFINED FEATURES AND HIS VOICE WAS SOFT AND PLEASANT IN TONE
ONE WOULD SUPPOSE THAT THEY KNEW NOTHING AT ALL ABOUT SCHOOL AFFAIRS BUT THEY DO
AT PRACTICALLY THE SAME INSTANT THE THIRD SHOT WHISTLED FROM THE EAST
A SHADOW THAT CHILLED HIS HEART SEEMED GRADUALLY TO FALL UPON HIM
IT NEVER OCCURRED TO HIM THAT HE MIGHT BE CHANGED CHANGED HERSELF
GOOD FRIENDS GOOD FRIEND SAID THE OTHER GENTLY I HAVE BUSINESS ELSEWHERE
THEREUPON I TOLD THE KING WITHOUT ANY RE RESERVE ALL THAT HAD HAPPENED
HANS WENT UP AND DOWN THE STREETS OF AMSTERDAM THAT DAY LOOKING FOR WORK
SIL

WORST DOSE <unk> I EVER ENDURED AND I'D NOTHING TO DO BUT SWELTER IN THAT HEAT
THE SHELVES WERE CROWDED WITH DUSTY UTENSILS OF ALL SORTS
SHE GATHERED UP THE MOSS AND THE REMAINS OF THE BEES WAX
HE HAS BROKEN NO WORD OF THE LAW OF THE JUNGLE
THAT'S A GOOD DOG ANYONE CAN TELL THAT
THE KING THOUGHT AND THOUGHT FROWNED HARD AND RUBBED HIS EAR
WHAT ARE THOSE FOOLISH BUNDLES IN THE BACK OF THIS SILLY CART
BUT I'M AWFULLY HUNGRY I WISH YOU'D GET ME SOMETHING TO EAT
MEN REJOICED OPENLY HOPING THAT IT WOULD SPREAD AND SEND THEM INTO CAMP
GREAT WAS THE INDIGNATION OF THAT NOBLE BIRD AS HE WATCHED THE SCENE BELOW
I THINK I SEE PEARLS AND DIAMONDS COME OUT OF THE GIRL'S MOUTH
WHAT IF I WHAT IF HE HAD BRAINS AND MILITARY SKILL AND ALL THAT SORT OF THING
SIL
YES SAID ANNE CAN CANDIDLY I'VE HEARD THAT YOU AND HE WERE ENGAGED ONCE
SIL
THE SLOWEST TURTLE
EVERY FOUR YEARS TURTLE FROM ALL OVER THE LAND WOULD CRAWL TO GREAT TO GREAT POND
IT WOULD T IT WOULD TAKE SOME TURTLES FROM FAR AWAY VILLAGES TWO WHOLE WEEKS JUST TO GET THERE
WHEN ALL THE TURTLES ARRIVED THERE WAS A SEVEN DAY FESTIVAL CALLED THE SHELL DWELLERS FESTIVAL WHERE THERE WAS LOTS OF EATING AND LAUGHING
TURTLES COULD CATCH UP WITH FRIENDS THEY HAD NOT SEEN SINCE THE LAST FESTIVAL
EVERYTHING ABOUT THE FESTIVAL WAS FUN BUT THE MAIN EVENT WAS THE GREAT TURTLE RACE
THE WINNER OF THE GREAT TURTLES RACE WAS SO IMPORTANT THAT HE OR SHE DIDN'T HAVE TO MOVE FOR FOUR YEARS UNTIL THE NEXT FESTIVAL
THE LESS A TURTLE MOVES THE BIGGER THEY GET AND THE LONGER THEY LIVE SO YOU CAN SEE
SIL
YOU CAN SEE WINNING THE GREAT RACE IS A GREAT HONOR
THE TURTLE CUP WAS A TROPHY THAT THE WINNER WOULD TAKE HOME TO THEIR VILLAGE
THE TURTLE CUP WAS IN SLUDGE POND FOR OVER FIFTY YEARS THAT'S BECAUSE NO ONE COULD EVER BEAT THE TURTLE FROM THERE
HE WAS THE SLOWEST TURTLE OF ALL TIME
IMAGINE HE HADN'T HAD TO MOVE FOR FIFTY YEARS
HE WAS THE BIGGEST MOST RESPECTED AND ONE OF THE TRICKIEST TURTLES IN HISTORY
SIL
THERE WERE MANY LEGENDS ABOUT HIM
IT WAS RUMORED
SIL
HE WAS WAS SO SLOW HIS HEART WOULD ONLY BEAT ONCE A DAY
HIS NAME WAS MUD AND HE WAS THE GREATEST CHAMPION IN THE HISTORY OF SHELL DWELLERS FESTIVAL HE WAS UNBEATABLE
WHEN MUD WAS IN HIS PRIME <unk> THERE WAS A NEW TURTLE BORN IN BLUE POND
THIS TURTLE WAS NAMED SWISH
WHEN SWISH WAS BORN EVERYONE THOUGHT HE WAS A LITTLE SLOW
BUT AS HE GOT A LITTLE OLDER THE TURTLES BEGAN TO REALIZE THAT SWISH WAS REALLY REALLY REALLY SLOW
ONCE HIS MOTHER CALLED HIM FOR DINNER AND HE DIDN'T MAKE IT HOME UNTIL BREAKFAST THE NEXT MORNING AND HE WAS ONLY A FOOT AWAY
BLUE POND WAS LOCATED ABOUT THREE DAYS CRAWL FROM THE GREAT POND
MOSTLY S NICE TURLES LIVED IN BLUE POND BUT THEY ALL FELT A LITTLE SAD BECAUSE THEY HADN'T <unk> HELD THE TURTLE CUP IN OVER SEVEN HUNDRED YEARS
SO WITH SWISH THEY THOUGHT MAYBE JUST MAYBE HE COULD BRING BACK THE TURTLE CUP
EVERYONE TREATED SWISH DIFFERENTLY FOR EXAMPLE MISTER PEEKS THE LOCAL SHELL CLEANER WOULD SAY
HEY THERE SWISH DO YOU WANT A FREE SHELL WAXING TODAY WE ALL WANT YOU TO GO TO LOOK GOOD WHEN YOU BRING HOME THE CUP
SIL
MR SNAPPER WOULD SAY HI SWISHY DO YOU WANT SOME YUMMY PIE TO FILL YOU UP AND SLOW YOU DOWN FOR THE BIG RACE A FAT TURTLE IS A SLOW TURTLE
MRS SNAPPER WAS NEVER NICE TO ANYONE BUT SHE WAS BEING NICE TO SWISH
MISTER PEEKS WOULD NEVER DO ANYTHING FOR FREE BUT HE WAS GOING TO GIVE SWISH A FREE SHELL WAXING
<unk> ALL THE ALL THE EXTRA ATTENTION MADE SWISH VERY UNCOMFORTABLE
SURELY THEY ARE NICE TO ME NOW BECAUSE THEY THINK I CAN WIN THE RACE BUT IF I LOSE THEY'LL BE DISAPPOINTED AND MAD AT ME
UH I NEVER PROMISED THAT I WOULD WIN THE RACE I CAN'T BEAT MUD ANYWAY
I HEARD ONCE IT TOOK HIM THREE DAYS JUST TO YAWN
SO ONE DAY HE TOLD HIS PARENTS I DON'T WANT TO RACE
ALL THE TURTLES IN BIG BLUE POND IN BLUE POND HELD A MEETING TO DISCUSS THE PROBLEM
THE MAYOR DOCTOR SOFTSHELL SAID THIS IS RIDICULOUS SWISH HAS TO RACE HE'S THE SLOWEST TURTLE I'VE EVERY SEEN EXCEPT FOR MUD OF COURSE
BUT WITHOUT HIM WE DON'T HAVE A CHANCE
BUT HE DOESN'T WANT TO BE TREATED SPECIAL HE JUST WANTS TO BE NORMAL AND HE DOESN'T WANT EVERYBODY TO HATE HIM IF HE CAN'T BEAT MUD
YOU HAVE
SIL
TO REMEMBER THAT EVEN THOUGH HE'S GIFTED HE'S STILL VERY YOUNG SAID SWISH'S FATHER
WE NEVER THOUGHT OF THAT THEY AGREED THEN THE TOWN AGREED TO TREAT SWISH LIKE A NORMAL TURTLE
AND AFTER A WHILE SWISH DECIDED THAT HE WOULD BE PROUD TO RACE FOR HIS VILLAGE
<unk> WHEN THE TIME OF THE FESTIVAL DREW NEAR ALL THE TURTLES IN THE LAND STARTED TOWARD GREAT POND
SWISH HAD TO BE CARRIED ON HIS FATHER'S BACK SINCE IT WOULD HAVE TAKEN HIM MONTHS TO GET TO GREAT POND BY HIMSELF
FINALLY AFTER THE LONG JOURNEY ALL THE TURTLES ARRIVED AT TH AT GREAT POND
THIS WAS SWISH'S FIRST EVER SHELL DWELLERS FESTIVAL
HE THOUGHT IT WAS THE MOST WONDERFUL THING HE HAD EVER SAW
THERE WERE THOUSANDS OF TURTLES MANY DIFFERENT SPECIES ALL HAVING A GREAT TIME
SIL
LOOK THERE'S YOUR COUSIN PEEK A BOO FROM BIG PUDDLE VILLAGE SAID SWISH'S MOTHER YOU'LL GET TO MEET ALL SORTS OF NEW TURTLES
I SWISH WAS SUDDENLY VERY EXCITED
HE TOLD HIS MOM YOU KNOW WHAT I'M GOING TO WIN THIS RACE I KNOW
SIL
I KNOW IT
AND ALL THESE TURTLES WILL KNOW THAT BLUE POND RULES I'M NOT AFRAID OF STUPID MUD
SWISH'S MOM SMILED AND SAID I KNOW THAT YOU CAN WIN SWISH BUT WE'LL BE PROUD OF YOU EVEN IF YOU DON'T WIN
IT'S AN HONOR JUST TO RA TO GET TO RACE SAID SWISH'S MOM
SWISH SAW A BIG ROCK IN THE MIDDLE OF THE BIG FESTIVAL AND WONDERED ABOUT IT
HOW CAN HOW COME THEY DON'T MOVE THAT BIG ROCK OUT OF THE FIELD IT SEEMS TO BE IN EVERYONE'S WAY SAID SWISH
THAT'S NOT A ROCK SWEETIE SAID HIS MOM THAT'S MUD
SWISH MADE A LOUD GULP SOUND
<unk> SWISH'S FATHER SAID SON DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT
YOU KNOW MY GRANDFATHER RACED MUD ONCE <unk> HE WASN'T AS SLOW AS YOU BUT HE DID TEACH ME A THING OR TWO
THEN HE TOLD SWISH ABOUT ALL OF THE MUD'S DIRTY TRICKS SO THAT SWISH WOULD BE READY FOR THEM
AFTER SEVEN DAYS OF PLAYING AND DANCING AND BUG EATING FINALLY THE DAY OF THE RACE CAME
SIL
THE MAYOR OF GREAT POND <unk> MRS TORT PASSED THE RULES OF THE RACE TO EVERYONE FOR TO SEE
THE RULES WERE NAILED TO A TREE TO TO A TREE FOR ALL TO SEE
THEY READ RULE NUMBER ONE THE GREAT RACE BEGINS AT SUNRISE AND ENDS AT SUNSET
RULE NUMBER TWO ALL TURTLES MUST RUN AS FAST AS THEY CAN AND THE TURTLE THAT IS CLOSEST TO THE STARTING LINE WINS
RULE NUMBER THREE NO TURTLE MAY PRETEND TO BE GOING AS FAST AS THEY CAN BUT GO SLOW INSTEAD
ALL TURTLE MUST GO AS FAST AS THEY CAN AT ALL TIMES
SINCE TURTLES NEVER CHEAT THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT RULE TO BREAK THIS RULE WOULD MEAN AN END TO THE GREAT TURTLE RACE FOREVER
RULE NUMBER FOUR <unk> NO TURTLE MAY FALL ASLEEP SINCE IF YOU ARE ASLEEP YOU AREN'T RUNNING AS FAST AS YOU CAN
SWISH READ THE RULES EVEN THOUGH HE KNEW THEM BY HEART
THEN HE HEARD THE MAYOR SAY RUNNER'S PLEASE TAKE YOUR POSITIONS
SIL
THE SLOWEST TURTLES FROM EACH POND WERE CARRIED TO THE STARTING LINE BY MEMBERS OF THEIR VILLAGES
THERE WERE ABOUT THREE HUNDRED TURTLES RACING
THEY WERE ALL THE SLOWEST OF SLOW
THE TURTLES ALL STRETCHED AND THOUGHT REALLY SLOW THOUGHTS
AND AS THEY DID N DID THE SKY TURNED FROM BLACK TO DARK BLUE
THEY LOOKED AT THE HORIZON AND SAW THE SUN WAS STARTING THE RISE JUST THEN THE MAYOR SAID READY SET SLOW AND OFF THEY WENT
ALL THE TURTLES WERE VERY VERY SLOW SO IT TOOK SOME TIME BEFORE ANYONE COULD FIGURE OUT WHICH TURTLES WERE THE SLOWEST
BUT AFTER A FEW HOURS MOST OF THE TURTLES HAD GONE A FEW FEET <unk> EXCEPT TWO
SWISH AND MUD WERE BOTH BACK AT THE STARTING LINE
IT LOOKED AS IF NEITHER OF THEM HAD MOVED AT ALL
THEY WERE BOTH MOVING OF COURSE OH OF COURSE BUT THEY WERE S SO SLOW THAT IT H WAS HARD TO TELL
AFTER SIX HOURS MUD AND SWISH WERE STILL TIED AND HAD ONLY MOVED A FEW INCHES
BY NOW ALL THE TURTLES WERE WAY AHEAD OF MUD BUT THIS TIME SWISH WAS JUST AS SLOW
MUD KNEW THAT THIS WOULD BE HIS CLOSEST RACE EVER AND HE WAS ACTUALLY GETTING A BIT SCARED OF SWISH KID OF THIS SWISH KID
WHO IS THIS YOUNG PUNK
SIL
HE THOUGHT TO HIMSELF
SIL
MUD SAID TO SWISH THERE'S THERE'S NO WAY THAT A TURTLE AS YOUNG AS YOU CAN BE SO SLOW
EVEN I WAS FASTER THAN YOU WHEN I WAS YOUR AGE YOU'RE CHEATING YOU'RE GOING TO RUIN THE GREAT RACE FOREVER
BUT SWISH WOULDN'T LET MUD SCARE HIM
YOU'RE JUST TRYING TO MAKE ME QUIT I'M NOT GOING TO FALL FOR YOUR TRICKS HE SAID
TURTLES NEVER CHEAT AND I'M A TURTLE WITH HONOR
THEN MUD TRIED ANOTHER TRICK
HE STARTED SINGING A SOFT BEAUTIFUL LULLABY
SWISH STARTED YAWNING
HE WAS TIRED FROM RACING BUT RACING AND THOUGHT THAT IT WOULD BE NI BE NICE J TO JUST LISTEN TO MUD'S SWEET VOICE AND FALL ASLEEP
THEN HE SNAPPED OUT OF IT AND REMEMBERED HIS FATHER TOLD HIM ABOUT THIS TRICK GA TRICK GAVE HIM EARPLUGS
SIL
HE PUT THE EARPLUGS IN
SIL
HIS EARS AND COULDN'T HEAR MUD'S SINGING ANYMORE
MUD KEPT SINGING HIS LULLABY FOR A FEW HOURS BUT HE STOPPED RIGHT BEFORE SUNSET
THE CROWD THOUGHT HE MUST HAVE REALIZED THAT IT WASN'T WORKING
BUT THEN RIGHT AT THE END RIGHT BEFORE THE SUNSET SWISH STARTED TO PULL AHEAD OF MUD
OH NO SHOUTED THE FANS MUD MUD'S WINNING IT LOOKS LIKE MUD IS STILL THE GREATEST TURTLE OF THEM ALL
AND WHEN THE SUN WENT DOWN MUD WAS THE CLOSEST TO THE STARTING LINE
SIL
SWISH WAS SAD
SIL
THAT HE HAD THAT HE LOST BUT ALL THE TURTLES FROM BLUE POND CHEERED FOR SWISH
THEY WERE VERY PROUD HE GAVE MUD SUCH A CLOSE RACE
SWISH WAS HAPPY T BUT BUT DEEP DOWN INSIDE HE KNEW HE WAS JUST AS SLOW AS MUD
THE MAYOR OF PONDLAND WENT TO PRESENT THE TURTLE CUP TO SLUDGE POND AGAIN
SHE ANNOUNCED WELL MUD IT LOOKS LIKE YOU'VE DONE YOU'VE DONE IT SLUDGE POND WINS THE TURTLE CUP AGAIN
THIS TIME IT WAS A BIT CLOSER THAN YOU WOULD HAVE LIKED I'LL BET
SIL
WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO SAY TO ALL THE TURTLES AT THE FESTIVAL THE CROWD STARTED YELLING SPEECH SPEECH
MUD DIDN'T ANSWER THE MAYOR TAPPED MUD ON THE SHELL AND SAID HELLO HELLO MUD
MUD STILL DIDN'T ANSWER IN FACT MUD WAS SOUND ASLEEP MUD HAD ACTUALLY SUNG HIMSELF TO SLEEP
SIL
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN SAID MS TORT
MUD FROM SLUDGE POND HAS BEEN DISQUALIFIED FOR SLEEPING DURING THE RACE
THIS MEANS THAT WE HAVE A NEW CHAMPION THE REAL WINNER IS SWISH SOFTBELLY OF BLUE POND THE CROWD WENT WILD
SIL
MS TORT WENT UP TO SWISH AND GAVE HIM THE TURTLE CUP
SHE SAID SWISH YOU ARE THE YOUNGEST WINNER OF THE GREAT TURTLE RACE THAT WAS THE MOST EXCITING FINISH WE'VE EVER HAD
I THINK THAT YOU'LL BE A GREAT CHAMPION FOR MANY YEARS SINCE TURTLES ONLY GET SLOWER WITH AGE
FOR THE FIRST TIME IN SIX HUNDRED YEARS I WOULD LIKE TO PRESENT THE TURTLE CUP TO BLUE POND THE CROWD WENT WILD AGAIN
SWISH TOOK THE CUP THAT DAY FOR THE FIRST TIME
HE WOULD TAKE IT MANY MORE TIMES AFTER THAT
SIL
IT WAS BECAUSE OF SWISH THAT BLUE POND BECAME THE MOST RESPECTED POND IN THE LAND
HE WOULD NEVER LOSE THE TURTLE CUP FOR THE REST OF HIS LONG LIFE
BUT THOUGH HE BECAME THE GREATEST AND BIGGEST TURTLE OF ALL TIME MUCH GREATER OR BIGGER THAN MUD
HE ALWAYS MADE SURE THAT NO ONE TREATED HIM SPECIAL AND THAT HE TREATED EVERYBODY LIKE HE WANTED TO BE TREATED LIKE A TURTLE WITH HONOR
SO THERE'S A TURTLE WHO IS REALLY YOUNG AND HE'S A REALLY SLOW TURTLE
AND THERE'S THIS ONE REALLY BIG SLOW TURTLE WHO'S THE SLOWEST TURTLE
AND SO THERE'S THIS RACE UHM FOR ALL THE DIFFERENT PONDS
AND THEY TRY TO FIND THE SLOWEST TURTLE FROM THE POND AND THEY ALL RACE AND THEY SEE WHICH IS THE SLOWEST TURTLE
AND THE SLOWEST TURTLE THEIR POND IS HONORED WITH A CUP AND SO SWISH IS REALLY YOUNG AND HE UHM RACES AGAINST MUD THE SLOWEST TURTLE FOR A LONG LONG TIME
AND PEOPLE START TREATING SWISH WITH UHM LIKE A LOT OF RESPECT AND THEY KEEP ON TREATING HIM SPECIALLY
AND SO UHM HE ASKES THEM NOT TO TREAT HIM SPECIALLY BECAUSE HE WON'T WANT TO RACE THEN
AND SO THEN THEY STOP TREATING HIM SPECIALLY AND HE RACES THE RACE AND HE DOESN'T WIN BUT
WHEN THE L LADY WHO MAKES THE RACE UHM WHEN SHE'S GIVING MUD THE UHM CUP UHM
SIL
HE FALLS ASLEEP AND SO THE MISS TORT WHO RUNS THE RACE UHM SHE SAYS MUD HAS BEEN DISQUALIFIED FOR SLEEPING THE REAL CHAMPION IS SWISH AND SWISH WINS AND IN THE END HE MAKES AND HE WINS AND HIS POND IS REALLY RESPECTED
AND HE MAKES SURE THAT NOBODY TREATS HIM SPECIALLY AND THAT EVERYBODY'S TREATED HOW HE HE IS TREATED
AFTER THE USUAL CEREMONIES THE PRINCE PRESENTED HIS PROPOSAL
NOW HE HAS GONE OFF AGAIN FOR THIS GAME IS GETTING SCARCE <unk> SCARCE S SCARCE
YES MY LORD S SAID THE MAN HE S HIS SUNBURNED FACE REDDENING
EVEN IF THERE HAS BEEN SOME LITTLE MISTAKE WHAT COULD I DO NOW TO FIX IT
FOR SEVERAL DAY DAYS THIS STRANGELY ASSORTED PAIR ROAMED THE JUNGLE TOGETHER
THE EARL LOOKED AT IT AND THE CORNERS OF HIS MOUTH TWITCHED A LITTLE
IF GOD SPARES BETH I'LL I NEVER WILL COMPLAIN AGAIN WHISPERED MEG EARNESTLY
FOR YOU AND ME THERE IS NOTHING TO HOPE FOR NOTHING BEYOND WHAT WE HAVE
SHE COULD SEE NOTHING EXCEPT THE MORNING GLORIES WHICH COVERED THE SIDE OF THE PORCH
WE NEVER KNEW THAT SUCH STRANGE PEOPLE EXISTED ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD
SHE MUST BEGIN WITH THE CHINESE DYNASTY <unk> AND END WITH JAPAN
IN THE DEEP GLOOM SHE COULD HEAR ER SHE COULD NOT SEE THE ANGER WHICH DARKENED HIS FACE
DIANA SEARCHED FAITHFULLY BUT NO AXE WAS TO BE FOUND IN THE WHOLE WOODSHED
SHE WANTS TO GIVE THAT BOY AN EXTREMELY BAD OPINION OF ME
I KNOW THE COUNTRY STOCK LAW JUST AS WELL AS YOU DO
HOW STRANGE THAT A LIVE LIVE ANIMAL SHOULD GROW ON A STALK LIKE A FLOWER
I GUESS I'LL BUY A FEW SNACKS SINCE THEY LOOK SO FUNNY COILING OUT
SEE THE WISDOM OF MY CHOICE HE SAID HOLDING UP THE LARGE LEAF OF GOLD
BUT I AM TOO OLD TO ENDURE YOUR SHAME AND MY MISERY MUCH LONGER
RATHER WOULD I FACE THREE STRONG MEN THAN ONE YOUNG DAMSEL
I WOULD LOVE DEARLY TO HEAR THESE PEOPLE DESCRIBE THEIR TRAVELS
SIL
ROOSTER JOHN
BEFORE I TELL YOU HOW ROOSTER JOHN GOT ITS NAME GOT HIS NAME YOU SHOULD KNOW A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE TOWN OF FRANKSVILLE
FRANKSVILLE WAS A TOWN THAT SEEMED TO HAVE ONE P ONE PROBLEM AFTER THE OTHER
THEIR PROBLEMS STARTED WHEN THEY RAN OUT OF WATER
THANKFULLY SOMEONE WAS DIGGING A HOLE AND FOUND WATER
BUT SOON AFTER THEY GOT AFTER THAT THEY STARTED TO GET F FLIES
THEY GOT TONS AND TONS OF FLIES THEY THEN THE FLIES STOPPED
BUT JUST THEN A MAN MOVED INTO TOWN WHO PLAYED THE FLUTE SO BADLY THAT PEOPLE WOULD RUN AWAY SCREAMING
MAYBE A POORLY PLAYED FLUTE DOESN'T SOUND ALL THAT BAD
BUT JUST TRY TO IMAGINE SOMEONE SCRATCHING A CHALKBOARD WITH A F FORK AND THEN MULTIPLY THAT TIMES A HUNDRED
THAT'S HOW THE FLUTE SOUNDED WHEN H WHEN THIS GUY PLAYED IT
I'M SERIOUS WHAT STILL IT'S STILL UH STILL IT'S NOT AS BAD AS MILLIONS OF FLIES I SUPPOSE
THE BAD FLUTE PLAYER WAS ROOSTER JOHN
HE WASN'T CALLED ROOSTER JOHN YET THAT CAME LATER
HE WAS THE NEW TOWN DENTIST HE WAS AN EXCELLENT DENTIST BUT HIS REAL LOVE WAS MUSIC
HE PLAYED MANY MUSICS MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS SUCH AS THE GUITAR THE TUBA THE PIANO AND THE CLARINET
HOWEVER FOR THE SAME R REASON THE WAY HIS MOUTH WAS SHAPED MADE HIS FLUTE SOUND AWFUL
SIL
WE CAN'T LET YOU PLAY THE FLUTE ANYMORE JOHN SAID POLICE CHIEF S SANDERS
THE NEIGHBORS ARE COMPLAINING AND THE CATS AND DOGS ARE TRYING TO CHEW OFF THEIR EARS
BUT I HAVE TO PLAY I WAS BORN TO DO IT
I DON'T KNOW WHY BUT I FEEL LIKE I HAVE TO DO I HAVE TO OR ELSE BAD THINGS WILL HAPPEN
LOOK JOHN I'VE HEARD YOU PLAY THE CLARINET YOU'RE QUITE GOOD WHY DON'T YOU PLAY THAT INSTEAD SAID THE CHIEF SANDERS
OH THAT'S A NICE INSTRUMENT BUT THAT'S JUST NOT THE FLUTE
I I EVEN WROTE YOU A SONG CHIEF SANDERS IT'S CALLED COPS AND ROBBERS
<unk> THEN HE PLAYED THE SONG THE POLICE CHIEF HATED THE SOUND SO MUCH THAT HE THREW JOHN IN JAIL
BUT THEY COULDN'T KEEP JOHN IN JAIL SINCE HE WASN'T REALLY BREAKING ANY LAWS SO THERE W THERE WAS NOTHING THAT NOTHING THE POLICE COULD DO
BESIDES EVERYBODY LOVED JOHN SINCE HE HAD BECOME THE TOWN DENTIST
EVERYBODY'S TEETH WERE SO MUCH TEETH WERE MUCH WHITER AND CLEANER AND NO ONE HAD ANY CAVITIES
SO THERE WAS A PROBLEM IN THE LITTLE TOWN OF FRANKSVILLE
SIL
WHAT SHOULD THEY DO THEY COULDN'T KEEP JOHN IN JAIL AND THEY DIDN'T WANT TO KI KICK HIM OUT OF TOWN BECAUSE THEY ALL H HAD SUCH NICE TEETH
SO THEY DECIDED THAT JOHN COULD PLAY THE FLUTE AND EVERYBODY ELSE WOULD HAVE TO WEAR EARPLUGS
WELL I'M SURE YOU GUESSED THAT DIDN'T WORK
NO ONE COULD HEAR ANYTHING
PEOPLE WERE GETTING INTO CAR ACCIDENTS AND EVERYBODY LOOKED REALLY SILLY AT DANCES DANCING TO MUSIC THEY COULDN'T HEAR
THEY JUST COULDN'T LEAD THE LEAD A NORMAL LIFE <unk>
TH <unk> THEN THEY DECIDED TO LOWER HIM DOWN A WELL AND LET HIM PLAY DOWN WHERE NO ONE COULD HEAR HIM
JOHN THOUGHT THAT THAT WASN'T AN
SIL
OK IDEA
BUT THERE WAS AN AN ECHO IN THE WELL THAT MADE THE FLUTE SOUND LOUDER
WINDOW WERE BREAKING AND ALL COWS IN TOWN STARTED TO MAKE SOUR MILK
HE THOUGHT THAT IF HE MADE A NEW MOUTHPIECE THAT ESPECIALLY SHAPED FOR JOHN'S MOUTH THAT THEN PERHAPS HE COULD PLAY THE FLUTE NORMALLY
AND GUESS WHAT IT WORKED
DOCTOR WONG WAS THE TOWN HERO
THE FLUTE SOUNDED NORMAL AND IT TURNED OUT JOHN COULD PLAY IT QUITE WELL
<br> THE PEOPLE IN THE TOWN DECIDED TO HAVE A GREAT BIG PARADE IN FRANKSVILLE
TO CELEBRATE THE FACT THAT FOR ONCE THERE WAS NO WATER PROBLEM NO FLY PROBLEM AND NO FLUTE PROBLEM
DOCTOR WONG AND JOHN WERE S THE STARS OF THE PARADE
THEY WERE UP T THEY WERE UP ON THE MAIN FLOAT
A BIG BAND PLAYED AS THEY MARCHED UP AND DOWN MAIN STREET EVERYONE CHEERED
SIL
<unk> THEN SUDDENLY A FLY LANDED ON A LITTLE GIRL
THEN THE FLY LANDED ON SOMEONE ELSE THEN THE THEN SOME LANDED ON A BUNCH OF PEOPLE
THEN PRETTY SOON TONS OF FLIES WERE LANDING ON EVERYONE BEFORE THEY KNEW IT THE TOWNS TOWN WAS FILLED WITH FLIES AGAIN
OH NO SAID SAID CHIEF SANDERS JUST WHEN THINGS WERE GO GOING GOOD IN FRANKSVILLE
JOHN DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO SO HE JUST KEPT ON PLAYING HIS FLUTE
THE FLIES WERE ANNOYING SO HE WOULD S SWAT AT THEM WITH HIS HAND OR EVEN HIS NEW FLUTE
SIL
HE STARTED SHAKING THE FLUTE S TO GET THE FLIES OFF AND ACCIDENTALLY SMASHED IT INTO PIECES
HE WAS VERY UPSET AT FIRST THEN HE SAID OH WELL GOOD THING I BROUGHT MY OLD FLUTE BACK AS BACK UP
NO NO PLEASE DON'T P DON'T PLAY YOUR OLD FLUTE BEGGED DOCTOR WONG
BUT IT WAS TOO LATE JOHN HAD STARTED PLAYING
WHEN THE TOWNSFOLK HEARD THE NOISE THEY COULDN'T EVEN SWAT AT THE FLIES ANYMORE
THEY HAD TO COVER THEIR EARS FROM HORRIBLE SOUND
THE FLIES WOULD LAND ALL OVER THE PEOPLE AND THEY COULDN'T SWAT SWAT THEM OFF
IT WAS GROSS THEN SUDDENLY THE FLIES FLEW AWAY FAST AS THEY COULD
DOCTOR WONG THOUGHT FOR A SECOND THEN P PRONOUNCED
IT'S THE FLUTE SOUND THE
SIL
THE FLIES HATE JOHN'S FLUTE PLAYING AS MUCH AS WE DO
JOHN THE DENTIST IS DRIVING THE F FLIES AWAY
IT WAS THEN THAT THE PEOPLE OF FRANKSVILLE REALIZED THAT THEY WOULD HAVE TO TAKE THE GOOD WITH THE BAD

BUT IT WAS HER FAULT
SHE WAS THE ONE WHO KEPT TRYING TO GIVE ME PEA PEANUTS
I TOLD HER THAT I WANTED A BANANA SPLIT INSTEAD BUT SHE SAID THEY DON'T HAVE BANANA SPLITS ON THE PLANE
SIL
BUT SOMETIMES PEOPLE LIKE TO EAT PEANUTS ON THEIR BANANA SPLITS SO I TOLD HER THAT
SIL
IT WAS THE PEANUTS THAT WERE MAKING ME SO THIRSTY IN THE FIRST PLACE
AND THAT IF
SIL
SHE WOULD GET ME A BANANA SPLIT I WOULDN'T HAVE TO GO THE BATHROOM SO MUCH
SHE TOLD ME TO BE QUIET AND WATCH THE MOVIE
I TRIED TO WATCH THE MOVIE BUT I HAD ALREADY SEEN THE ONE SO IT WAS BORING
THE FLIGHT ATTENDANT GAVE ME A DECK OF CARDS BUT SHE WOULDN'T PLAY GO FISH WITH ME
SHE SAID SHE HAD TO
SIL
UHM SHE HAD TO HELP OTHER PASSENGERS
I HAD A GAME BOY IN MY BACKPACK
MY PACK MY BACKPACK WAS IN
SIL
WAS IN THE OVERHEAD THINGY
I TRIED TO PUSH THE BUTTON THAT LIGHTS UP OVER THE H OVER MY HEAD SO THE FLIGHT ATTENDANT WOULD COME
BUT GUESS WHAT I WAS TOO SHORT TO REACH THE BUTTON SO I STARTED YELLING HEY PEANUT LADY HEY PEANUT LADY
SIL
SHE LIKED BEING CALLED PEANUT LADY
SH
OH SHE DIDN'T LIKE BEING CALLED PEANUT LADY
SIL
BUT SHE DID GET ME
SIL
MY GAME BOY
SIL
SHE TOLD ME TO CALL HER JENNIFER INSTEAD
I PLAYED ON MY GAME BOY UNTIL I GOT MY NEW HIGH SCORE
THEN JENNIFER CAME UP TO ME AND SAID SHE HAD A SURPRISE I THOUGHT GREAT MORE PEANUTS
BUT IT WASN'T PEANUTS IT WAS SOMETHING REALLY COOL
SHE SAID THE CAPTAIN WAS INVITING ME TO S SEE THE COCKPIT
I THOUGHT AWESOME
SIL
I ALSO BROUGHT MY DECK OF CARDS IN CASE THE PILOT WAS BORED AND WANTED TO PLAY GO FISH
SIL
JENNIFER TOOK
SIL
ME INTO THE COCKPIT AND THERE WAS THERE WERE A MILLION BUTTONS AND LEVERS AND KNOBS AND STUFF
SIL
AT FIRST I THOUGHT WOW LOOK AT ALL THESE BUTTONS THEN I THOUGHT
SIL
THERE'S NO WAY THAT ANYONE CAN REMEMBER TO PUSH TH ALL THESE BUTTONS AT THE RIGHT TIME WE ARE GOING TO CRASH
SIL
THE WAY I FIGURED IT MY GAME BOY ONLY WAS FIVE
SIL
FIVE BUTTONS AND I
SIL
CAN'T GET PAST THREE LEVELS
IMAGINE HOW HARD IT WOULD BE TO WORK WITH MILLIONS OF BUTTONS AND GET AND EAT PEANUTS
THE PILOTS TOLD ME THAT
SIL
IT WASN'T REALLY HARD ONCE YOU PRACTICED
THEN HE TOLD ME THAT
SIL
HE ONCE PLAYED THE GAME I HAD ON MY GAME BOY AND HE COULDN'T EVEN PASS LEVEL ONE
I SAID IF YOU CAN'T EVEN GET PAST LEVEL ONE AND YOU'RE A PILOT THEN COULDN'T
SIL
BE THEN I COULD BE A PILOT TOO SINCE I'M MUCH BETTER AT PUSHING BUTTONS THAN YOU ARE
HE LAUGHED EVEN THOUGH I WASN'T JOKING
SIL
HE SAID HE THOUGHT
SIL
I WOULD MAKE A GREAT PILOT SOMEDAY IF I WANTED TO BE
HE WAS REALLY NICE BUT HE WOULDN'T PLAY GO FISH WITH ME
FINALLY WE LANDED
THAT'S ALWAYS SCARY IT SEEMED LIKE THE PLANE
SIL
IS GOING TOO FAST TO EVER STOP BUT IT DOES
SIL
WHEN I GOT OFF THE AIRPLANE
<unk>
THERE WAS GRANDPA WAITING FOR ME HE SAID HOW WAS YOUR FLIGHT
I SAID SOMEDAY I'M GOING TO BE A PILOT AND I'LL ONLY SERVE BANANA SPLITS ON THE PLANE
GRANDPA LAUGHED AND TOOK ME STRAIGHT TO THE ICE CREAM SHOP
IT WAS WORTH THE WHOLE TRIP JUST TO EAT A BANANA SPLIT WITH GRANDPA
UHM THERE WAS A KID AND IT WAS HIS FIRST TIME RIDING AN AIRPLANE
SIL
UHM
SIL
SO AT FIRST HE WAS REALLY SCARED
SIL
AND HIS MOM GAVE HIM A COLORING BOOK SO TO KEEP HIM BUSY AND HE WAS ON THIS PLANE BY HIMSELF SO
SIL
HE GOT REALLY SCARED AFTER AWHILE AND UHM
SIL
<unk>
BUT THE GOOD THING HE SAID ABOUT BEING ALONE UHM
SIL
THE
SIL
LIKE THE
SIL
CAR THE
SIL
UHM
SIL
CAN'T REMEMBER IT'S LIKE SORT OF THE WAITRESS ON THE PLANE AND UHM
SIL
SHE LIKE REALLY TOOK CARE OF HIM AND GAVE HIM LOTS OF DRINKS AND PEANUTS AND ALL SORTS OF STUFF AND HE HAD TO KEEP GOING TO THE BATHROOM CAUSE HE DRANK SO MUCH
AND TOWARDS THE END UHM THE PILOT LET HIM SEE THE COCKPIT
SIL
AND
SIL
HE
SIL
HE SAID HE WANTED TO BE A PILOT SOMEDAY AND THEN AFTER HE GOT OFF THE PLANE HIS GRANDPA TOOK HIM TO GET A BANANA SPLIT
IT WAS A DEEP DAZZLING LOVELY BLUE DEEPER THAN THE DEEPEST BLUE OF THE SKY
YES SAID ANNE CANDIDLY <unk> I'VE HEARD THAT YOU AND HE WERE ENGAGED ONCE
HE HAD GENTLE AND REFINED FEATURES AND HIS VOICE WAS SOFT AND PLEASANT IN TONE
ONE WOULD SUPPOSE THAT THEY KNEW NOTHING AT ALL ABOUT SCHOOL AFFAIRS BUT THEY DO
AT PRACTICALLY THE SAME INSTANT THE THIRD SHOT WHISTLED FROM THE EAST
A SHADOW THAT CHILLED HIS HEART SEEMED GRADUALLY TO FALL UPON HIM
IT NEVER OCCURRED TO HIM THAT SHE MIGHT BE CHANGED HERSELF
GOOD FRIEND SAID THE OTHER GENTLY I HAVE BUSINESS ELSEWHERE
THEREUPON I TOLD THE KING WITHOUT ANY RESERVE ALL THAT HAPPENED
HANS WENT UP AND LOOKED AT THE STREETS OF AMSTERDAM THAT DAY LOOKING FOR WORK
YES SAID BEN IMMENSELY RELIEVED TO FIND THAT NO OFFENSE HAD BEEN TAKEN
WORST DOSE I EVER ENDURED AND I I'D NOTHING TO DO BUT SWELTER IN THAT HEAT
THE SHELVES WERE CROWDED WITH DUSTY UTENSILS OF ALL SORTS
SHE GATHERED UP THE MOSS AND THE REMAINS OF THE BEES WAX
HE HAD BROKEN NO WORD OF THE LAW O OF THE JUNGLE
THAT'S A GOOD DOG ANYONE CAN TELL THAT
THE KING THOUGHT AND THOUGHT FROWNED HARD AND RUBBED HIS EAR
WHAT ARE THOSE FOOLISH BUNDLES IN THE BACK OF THAT SILLY CART
BUT I'M AWFULLY HUNGRY I WISH YOU'D GET ME SOMETHING TO EAT
MEN REJOICED OPENLY HOPING THAT IT WOULD SPREAD AND SEND THEM INTO CAMP
MARCO ONLY STOOD QUITE STILL AND LOOKED AT HIM WITH UNDERSTANDING AND GRAVITY
SIL
GREAT WAS THE INDIGNATION <unk> OF THE NOBLE BIRD AS HE WATCHED THE SCENE BELOW
I THINK I SEE PEARLS AND DIAMONDS COME OUT OF THE GIRL'S MOUTH
WHAT IF HE HAD BRAINS AND MILITARY SCHOOL AND ALL THAT SORT OF THING
SIL
<br>
ROOSTER JOHN
BEFORE I TELL YOU HOW ROOSTER JOHN GOT HIS NAME YOU SHOULD KNOW A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE T TOWN OF FRANKSVILLE
FRANKSVILLE WAS A TOWN THAT SEEMED TO HAVE ONE PROBLEM AFTER THE OTHER
THEIR PROBLEMS STARTED WHEN THEY RAN OUT OF WATER
THANKFULLY SOMEONE WAS DIGGING A HOLE AND FOUND WATER BUT SOON AFTER THAT THEY STARTED TO GET FLIES
THEY GOT TONS AND TONS OF FLIES THEN THE FLIES STOPPED
BUT JUST THEN A MAN MOVED INTO TOWN WHO PLAYED THE FLUTE SO BADLY THAT PEOPLE WOULD RUN AWAY SCREAMING
MAYBE A POORLY PLAYED FLUTE DOESN'T SOUND ALL THAT BAD
BUT JUST TRY TO IMAGINE SOMEONE SCRATCHING ON A CHALKBOARD WITH A FORK AND THEN MULTIPLY THAT TIMES A HUNDRED
THAT'S HOW THE FLUTE SOUNDED WHEN THIS GUY PLAYED IT I'M SERIOUS
STILL IT'S NOT AS BAD AS MILLIONS OF FLIES I SUPPOSE
THE BAD FLUTE PLAYER WAS ROOSTER JOHN
HE WASN'T CALLED ROOSTER JOHN YET THAT CAME LATER
HE PLAYED MANY MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS SUCH AS THE GUITAR THE TUBA THE PIANO AND THE CLARINET
HOWEVER FOR SOME REASON THE WAY HIS MOUTH WAS SHAPED MADE HIS FLUTE SOUND AWFUL
SIL
WE CAN'T LET YOU PLAY THAT FLUTE ANYMORE JOHN SAID POLICE CHIEF SANDERS
THE NEIGHBORS ARE COMPLAINING AND THE CATS AND DOGS ARE TRYING TO CHEW OFF THEIR EARS
BUT
SIL
I HAVE TO PLAY I WAS BORN TO DO IT
I DON'T KNOW WHY BUT I FEEL LIKE I HAVE TO DO TO OR ELSE BAD THINGS WILL HAPPEN
LOOK JOHN I'VE HEARD YOU PLAY THE CLARINET YOU'RE QUITE GOOD WHY DON'T YOU PLAY THAT INSTEAD SAID CHIEF SANDERS
OH WHY THAT'S A NICE INSTRUMENT BUT IT'S JUST NOT THE FLUTE
I EVEN EVEN WROTE YOU A SONG CHIEF SANDERS IT'S CALLED COPS AND ROBBERS
THEN HE PLAYED THE SONG
THE POLICE CHIEF HATED THE SOUND SO MUCH THAT HE THREW JOHN IN JAIL
BUT THEY COULDN'T KEEP JOHN IN JAIL SINCE HE WASN'T REALLY BREAKING ANY LAWS SO THERE WAS NOTHING THE POLICE COULD DO
BESIDES EVERYBODY LOVED JOHN SINCE HE HAD BECOME THE TOWN DENTIST EVERYBODY'S TEETH WERE MUCH WHITER AND CLEANER AND NO ONE HAD ANY CAVITIES
SO THERE WAS A PROBLEM IN THE LITTLE TOWN OF FRANKSVILLE
WHAT SHOULD THEY DO THEY SHOULDN'T KEEP JOHN IN JAIL AND THEY DIDN'T WANT TO KICK HIM OUT OF TOWN BECAUSE THEY ALL HAD SUCH NICE TEETH
SO THEY DECIDED THAT JOHN COULD PLAY THE FLUTE AND EVERYBODY ELSE WOULD HAVE TO WEAR EARPLUGS
WELL I'M SURE YOU GUESSED THAT DIDN'T WORK
NO ONE COULD HEAR ANYTHING PEOPLE WERE GETTING INTO CAR ACCIDENTS AND EVERYBODY LOOKED REALLY SILLY AT DANCES DANCING TO MUSIC THEY COULDN'T HEAR
THEY JUST COULDN'T LEAD A NORMAL LIFE
THEN THEY DECIDED TO LOWER HIM DOWN INTO A WELL AND LET HIM PLAY DOWN WHERE NO ONE COULD HEAR HIM
JOHN THOUGHT THAT WAS AN OK IDEA BUT THERE WAS AN ECHO IN THE WELL THAT MADE HIS FLUTE SOUND LOUDER
WINDOWS WERE BREAKING AND ALL THE COWS IN TOWN STARTED TO MAKE SOUR MILK
THE LOCAL D SCIENTIST DOCTOR WONG CAME UP WITH AN IDEA
HE THOUGHT THAT IF HE MADE A NEW MOUTHPIECE ESPECIALLY SHAPED FOR JOHN'S MOUTH
THEN THE TOWN DECIDED TO HAVE A GREAT BIG PARADE IN FRANKSVILLE
TO CELEBRATE THE FACT THAT FOR ONCE THERE WAS NO WATER PROBLEM NO FLY PROBLEM AND NO FRUIT FLUTE PROBLEM
DOCTOR WONG AND JOHN WERE ALL THE STARS OF THE PARADE
THEY WERE UP IN ON THE MAIN FLOAT
A BIG BAND BAND PLAYED AS THEY MARCHED UP AND DOWN MAIN STREET EVERYONE CHEERED
THEN SUDDENLY A FLY LANDED ON A LITTLE GIRL
THEN A FLY LANDED ON SOMEONE ELSE THEN SOME LANDED ON A BUNCH OF PEOPLE THEN PRETTY SOON TONS OF FLIES WERE LANDING ON EVERYONE
BEFORE THEY KNEW IT THE TOWN WAS FILLED WITH FLIES AGAIN
OH NO SAID CHIEF SANDERS JUST WHEN THINGS WERE GOING GOOD FOR FRANKSVILLE
JOHN DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO SO HE JUST KEPT ON PLAYING HIS FLUTE
THE FLIES WERE ANNOYING SO HE WOULD SWAT AT THEM WITH HIS HAND OR EVEN HIS NEW FLUTE
HE STARTED SHAKING THE FLUTE TO GET THE FLIES OFF AND ACCIDENTALLY SMASHED IT INTO PIECES
HE WAS VERY UPSET AT FIRST THEN HE SAID OH WELL GOOD THING I BOUGHT BROUGHT MY OLD FLUTE AS AS BACK UP
NO NO PLEASE DON'T PLAY YOUR OLD FLUTE BEGGED DOCTOR WONG
BUT IT WAS TOO LATE JOHN HAD STARTED PLAYING
WHEN THE TOWNSFOLK HEARD THE NOISE THEY COULDN'T EVEN SWAT AT THE FLIES ANYMORE
THEY HAD TO COVER THEIR EARS FROM THE HORRIBLE SOUND
THE FLIES WOULD LAND ALL OVER THE PEOPLE AND THEY COULDN'T SWAT AT THEM IT WAS GROSS THEN SUDDENLY THE FLIES FLEW AWAY FAST AS THEY COULD
DOCTOR WONG THOUGHT FOR A SECOND THEN PRONOUNCED IT'S THE FLUTE SOUND THE FLIES HATE JOHN'S FLUTE PLAYING AS MUCH AS WE DO
JOHN THE DENTIST IS DRIVING THE FLIES AWAY
IT WAS THEN THAT THE PEOPLE OF FRANKSVILLE REALIZED THAT THEY WOULD HAVE TO TAKE THE GOOD WITH THE BAD
BECAUSE AS BAD AS THE FLUTE SOUNDED IT WAS A LOT BETTER THAN THOUSANDS OF FLIES CRAWLING ON THEM
<unk> FROM THEN ON JOHN WOULD WAKE UP AT SUNRISE LIKE A ROOSTER AND PLAY TO KEEP THE FLIES AWAY
OK WELL UHM THIS STORY WAS ABOUT ROOSTER JOHN AND HE PLAYED THE FLUTE AND THE CLAIRINET AND ANOTHER INSTRUMENT
AND UHM WELL THE FLUTE SOUNDED REALLY BAD WHEN HE PLAYED IT AND HE DIDN'T WANT TO PLAY THE OTHER INSTRUMENTS EVEN THOUGH THEY SOUNDED GOOD
AND THEY DIDN'T WANT TO KICK HIM OUT OF THE TOWN BECAUSE HE WAS A REALLY GOOD DENTIST AND HE KEPT THEIR TEETH CLEAN
AND UHM HE THEN AT THE PARADE THEY GOT HIM A NEW FLUTE AND DOCTOR WONG MADE IT THE SCIENTIST OF THE TOWN TO FIT HIS LIPS
AND SO UHM IT SOUNDED REALLY GOOD BUT THEN ALL THESE FLIES STARTED COMING
SO SO HE TRIED TO SWAT AT THEM WITH HIS FLUTE BUT IT BROKE TO PIECES
SO HE STARTED PLAYING HIS OLD FLUTE AND ALL THE FLIES LEFT SO NOW UHM THEY CAN
SIL
HE JUST PLAYS HIS FLUTE AND FLIES GO AWAY
SIL
THEY UHM PLUGGED THEIR EARS AND THEY THREW HIM IN THE WELL AND THEY THREW HIM IN JAIL
SIL
SHE SAW THAT SHE WAS ON THE GRASS AND THE BROKEN WHEEL BESIDE HER
SIL
KNOW NOW THEN THAT THAT IF I TELL YOU THE REASON I SHALL INSTANTLY DIE
AH I KNOW SAID THE DAMN THE DAME GENTLY FEARING TO INTERRUPT THE STORY
YOU CERTAINLY ARE AN ABLE MINDED YOUNGSTER HERMAN HIRAM <unk> HE OBSERVED
AFTER DINNER JORDAN CREPT UP BY WAY OF THE BACK STAIRS TO SEE HER
THEN THEY JOURNEYED ONWARDS TILL THEY ALMOST REACHED THE MOUNTAINS
THEY SWORD THE S THY SWORD CANNOT STAND AGAINST AN OAKEN STAFF SUCH AS MINE
FOR YOU NEVER KNEW NEVER KNEW EXACTLY WHAT THIS MAN MIGHT SAY OR DO
AND STILL SHE SAT AND STILL SHE REELED AND STILL SHE WISHED FOR COMPANY
DON'T MAKE ANY OF YOUR ABRUPT REMARKS OR DO ANYTHING ODD WILL YOU
HE TITLED HIS HAT BRIM TO SHADE HIS FACE AND LOOK FOR HIS CHICKENS
THE POOR PERSECUTED <unk> COUNTRY PEOPLE BELIEVED THAT THE NEW FOREST WAS ENCHANTED
TOM'S COSTUME WAS A SPLENDID IMITATION OF A COWBOY
YOUR LORDSHIP IS GENTLE TO BE CONGRATULATED HE SAID WARMLY
IT WAS THAT DAY WHEN YOU GOT YOUR TOE POUNDED ADDED DAVE DAVIE LOOKING AT JOEL
SIL
NAN RECEIVED A SEWING MACHINE TO REMIND HER OF THE FRESH AIR WORK
WE ALL LOOKED AT EACH OTHER TRYING TO GLEAN SOMETHING EACH FROM THE OTHER
DIANA SHOOK HER HEAD GLEEFULLY HER BLACK EYES DANCING WITH MERRIMENT <unk>
THEN HE PULLED THE HOOD OF HIS CLOAK OVER HIS EARS AND OVER HIS BROW
WHICH OF YOU BOYS PLACED THIS STONE SINGLE ASKED THE YOUNG EXPLORER
THEY SHOOK THE FLOOR OFF THEY SHOOK THE FLOUR OFF HER AND SET HER DOWN ON THE KITCHEN FLOOR
I BEG YOUR PARDON SAID THE LEARNED MAN IT IS AN OLD HABIT OF ME
<br>
THE PANDA
IT IT WAS FRED'S IDEA SO LET'S BEGIN WITH FRED
FRED FED THE PANDA BEARS THE TIGERS AND TURTLES
THE TURTLES WERE SO BAD BUT
SIL
WEREN'T SO BAD BUT AS FOR THE TIGERS HE HE WASN'T SO SURE
<br> HE DIDN'T MIND HANDLING THE RAW MEAT HE HAD TO FEED TO THE TIGERS HIS MAIN OBJECT WAS TO BE WAS TO BEING EATEN
NO ONE COULD BLAME FRED REALLY SINCE NO ONE REALLY WANTS TO BE EATEN
SOME PEOPLE DO LIKE TO BITE THEIR FINGER NAILS BUT FRED WASN'T A NAIL BITER SO BEING EATEN WAS DEFINITELY NOT SOMETHING HE LOOKED FORWARD TO EACH AFTERNOON AT THREE O'CLOCK WHEN IT WAS TIME TO FEED THE TIGERS
BUT THE POINT IS THAT HE WAS VERY FOND OF FEEDING THE PANDAS
<br> THERE WERE THREE PANDAS AND THEY WERE KNOWN AS THE PAN FAMILY
THERE WERE THEY WERE IN ORDER OF CUTENESS YIN YIN THE YOUNG DAUGHTER POO POO THE MOTHER AND MOO MAN THE GENTLE AND ALWAYS
SIL
SLEEPY FATHER
MANY PEOPLE KNOW KNOW THAT PANDAS EAT BAMBOO A LOT OF IT
A LOT OF BAMBOO CAN GET QUITE HEAVY SO BECAUSE OF THE PANDAS FRED BECAME VERY STRONG AND WAS IN TERRIFIC SHAPE
THE ONL THE OTHER REASON WAS THAT ANYONE WHO GETS WITHIN THREE FEET OF A PANDA AUTOMATIC AUTOMATICALLY FALLS IN LOVE WITH THEM
IT'S A LAW OF NATURE AF AT FUTURE AT FURTHER DISTANCE PANDAS HAVE A STRANGE ALMOST MAGICAL EFFECT ON HUMAN BEINGS WHICH MAKES US WANT TO HUG AND SQUEEZE THINGS
FRED WAS NOT ALLOWED TO ACTUALLY HUG THE PANDA BEARS SINCE THAT COULD BE DANGEROUS SO ALL THE OTHER PEOPLE AT THE ZOO WOULD KNOW THAT THE PANDAS HAD JUST BEEN FED WHEN THEY SAW FRED HUGGING THE RATHER UN CUDDLY PALM TREE OUTSIDE OF THE PANDA'S HOME <unk>
SIL
IT IS INTERESTING TO POINT OUT AT THIS TIME THAT MORE STUFFED PANDA BEARS ARE SOLD
SIL
SOLD AT ZOO GIFT SHOPS THEN ALL OF THE OTHER STUFF ANIMALS COMBINED
THIS CAN ALMOST CERTAINLY BE ACCOUNTED FOR BY THE STRANGE ALMOST MAGICAL EFFECT THAT THE PANDAS POSSESS
BUT EVERYTHING WAS NOT ALL BAMBOO AND HUGS AT THE ZOO
ONE MORNING FRED WAS FEEDING YIN YIN AND SAID OH YIN YIN I WISH THAT MORE PEOPLE WOULD COME TO VISIT THE ZOO
I KNOW I SHOULDN'T BE TELLING YOU THIS BUT WE MIGHT HAVE TO SELL YOU AND YOUR FAMILY TO THE BIG ZOO IN SAN ANGELES
SIL
IF WE DON'T GET MORE MONEY IT'S NOT THAT YOU AREN'T S SELLING ENOUGH STUFFED STUFFED PANDA BEARS
IT'S JUST THAT THERE HAVEN'T BEEN ENOUGH PEOPLE COMING TO SEE YOU IN THE FIRST PLACE
I THINK WHAT THE ZOO NEEDS IS A GREAT ADVERTISING CAMPAIGN
FRED WAS STANDING TO STARTING TO FEEL THE UNCOMFORTABLE URGE TO HUG THE PANDA
SO BEFORE HE RAN OFF TO HUG THE PALM TREE QUICKLY QUI TRI TREE QUICKLY SAID ITS COSTS SO MUCH TO FEED Y YOU PANDA BEARS I WOULD HATE IT IF Y IF YOU HAD TO LEAVE US
<unk> AFTER ALL IT'S THE ONLY HOME YOU KNOW BESIDES IF YOU LEAVE I'LL GET TERRIBLY OUT OF SHAPE
NOW IF YOU EXCUSE ME I NEED TO SQUEEZE SOMETHING BEFORE I SCREAM SCREAM
SIL
BUT YIN YIN THE YOUNG PANDA WAS NOT LISTENING TO FRED SHE WAS TALKING TO HER BEST FRIEND MAGGIE THE MAGPIE ABOUT GOING TO THE MOON
YES THE BIG ONE IN THE SKY THAT IS MOST LIKELY NOT MADE OF CHEESE AND MOST CERTAINLY NOT MADE OF BAMBOO
YIN YIN SAID H AND HER BEST FRIEND MAGGIE THE MAGPIE WHO LOOKED A LOT LIKE A PANDA WOULD LOOK IF PANDA
SIL
PANDA WOULD LOOK IF PANDAS WERE BIRDS
HER MOTHER AND H AND FATHER KNEW WHAT THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT SINCE THEY HAD THOUGHT OR TALKED OF SUCH ELSE SINCE YIN YIN SAID I WANT TO GO THERE AND P AND POINTED TO THE MOON
ENOUGH OF THE NONSENSE UH NONSENSE SAID YIN YIN'S MOTHER POO POO
WHAT SORT OF NONSENSE IS THIS FOR A YOUNG PAPA FOR A YOUNG PANDA BEAR GOING TO THE MOON INDEED NONSENSE
YOUR JOB IS TO BE CUT IS TO BE CUTE SO PEOPLE WANT TO RUN TO THE GIFT SHOP AND BUY PANDA BEAR DOLLS
IT'S SIMPLE ECONOMICS LIKE IT OR NOT WE ARE SPOKESPEOPLE FOR THE PANDA STUFFED ANIMALS
SIL
ANIMAL INDUSTRY W WHICH YOUNG LADY HELPS PAY FOR THE BAMBOO THAT YOU EAT
SUCH NONSENSE GOING TO THE MOON SAID HER MOTHER POO POO
<br> BUT I JUST LEARNED NOW HOW TO MAKE MYSELF INTO A BALL AND ROLL TWO DAYS AGO AND I'M BECOMING VERY GOOD AT IT
I DON'T THINK IT WILL TAKE THAT LONG TO ROLL THERE SAID YIN YIN
YIN YIN'S FATHER MOO MAN DIDN'T THINK IT WAS A VERY P PROPER OR WISE FOR A YOUNG PANDA BEAR TO GO ROLLING OFF TO PLACES WHERE THERE WASN'T ANY BAMBOO
BUT <unk> HE WAS SUPPORTIVE OF HIS YOUNG DAUGHTER AND SHOWED HIS SUPPORT BY TAKING A NAP
BUT BEFORE HE FELL ASLEEP HE DID MANAGE TO SAY I BELIEVE ROLLING IS A DECIDEABLE
SIL
DECIDEALLY ROUND ABOUT WAY TO GO
IF YOU MUST GO IT
SIL
IT WOULD BE BEST TO FLY
NONSENSE SAID THE MOTHER
I'M SO MAD I'M GOING TO LOOK AT AT A LADY OVER THERE AND MAKE HER WANT TO SQUEEZE HER SON CHEEKS
<unk> SHE WAS SPIT SPITEFUL
SIL
SPITEFULLY
AN INSTANT LATER A YOUNG BOY WAS HEARD SAYING OUCH MOM CUT THAT OUT
<unk> YIN YIN WAS ALWAYS ONE TO TAKE GOOD ADVICE FROM HER FATHER AND LESS THAN A WEEK LATER YIN YIN AND MAGGIE HAD BUILT A ROCKET SHIP OUT OF BAMBOO
BAMBOO IS VERY WORKABLE SUB SUBSTANCE AND PANDAS TEND TO HANDLE BAMBOO A LOT A LOT SO THIS IS ITSELF WAS NOT THAT ASTONISHING AT LEAST TO YIN YINS PARENTS
FRED WAS IMPRESSED THOUGH
THE THE MAIN OBSTACLE IT TURNS OUT WAS GETTING THE ROCKET SHIP OFF THE GROUND
MAGGIE FIGURED THAT IF HER AND THREE OF THE STRONGEST MAGPIE FRIENDS WERE TO EACH GRAB HOLD OF THE CORNER OF THE ROCKET SHIP THEY COULD ALL FLY TO THE MOON
<unk> SO THEY TRIED
ONE TWO THREE TO THE MOON THEY SAID TOGETHER PULLING
SIL
PULLING WITH ALL THEIR MIGHT
I SEE YOUR WINGS FLAPPING BUT WE DON'T SEEM TO BE GOING ANYWHERE SAID YIN YIN
HMM HEAVIER THAN I THOUGHT I THINK WE WILL NEED MORE MAGPIES SAID MAGGIE
YES BUT HOW MANY MORE YIN YIN SAID
I'M NOT EXACTLY QUI I'M NOT SURE EXACTLY REPLIED MAGGIE
THE FATHER WATCHING THIS I THIS IS ALL THROUGH ONE EYE FOR HE ALWAYS HAD AT LEAST ONE EYE ASLEEP AT ALL TIMES
SAID IT TE WOULD BE BEST TO ASK THE OWL THEN CLOSED HIS EYES HIS EYE
SO MAGGIE FLEW TO THE OLD OWL AND ASKED FOR HIS ADVICE
OH WISE OWL I HAVE A QUESTION THAT I FEAR ONLY YOU CAN ANSWER SHE SAID
HOW TO TURN
SIL
TURN YOUR HEAD ALL THE WAY AROUND WITHOUT GETTING A TERRIBLE PAIN IN YOUR NECK SAID THE OWL
NO HOW MANY MAGPIES WOULD BE NEEDED TO FLY A FOUR HUNDRED POUND PANDA BEAR AND ONE HUNDRED POUND BAMBOO ROCKET SHIP TO THE MOON SAID MAGGIE
THE OWL INTI INSTANTLY REPLIED TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND AND SIX AND SEVENTY SIX GIVE IT OR TAKE TWO
SIL
A WEEK LATER MAGGIE MANAGED TO ROUND UP TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND AND SEVENTY EIGHT MAGPIE
SIL
SHE COULD BE A VERY PERSUASIVE LITTLE BIRD WHEN SHE WANTED
SIL
<br> A WEEK LATER DESPITE MUCH FLAPPING THERE WERE STI THEY THEY WERE STILL TRYING AND TO GET THE ROCKET IN THE AIR
IT TURNS OUT THAT THE OWL DIDN'T TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION THAT ONCE YOU GET OVER ONE THOUSAND MAGPIE TOGETHER THEY TEND TO FIGHT AND CAN'T AGREE O ON A SINGLE THING
NOW WHILE ALL THIS WAS GOING ON WHAT DO YOU SUPPOSE FRED WAS DOING
WHY HE WAS FEEDING THE PANDAS LIKE HE WAS SUPPOSED TO
SO ONE DAY AFTER FRED FRED HAD FED THE PANDAS AND WAS HUGGING THE PALM TREE THE ZOO MANAGER CAME UP TO HIM AND SAID
WHAT IS GOING ON WITH YOUR PANDAS FRED I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT
OH WELL THAT MAKES SENSE THEN SAID THE MANAGER
DO YOU KNOW THAT SINCE THE LITTLE PANDA BUILT THAT BAMBOO ROCKETSHIP AND THOSE MAGPIE'S STARTED FLUTTERING ABOUT THAT
SIL
THAT THE ZOO'S PROFITS HAVE GONE UP FOUR THOU FOUR THOUSAND PERCENT
THIS IS JUST THE TYPE OF EXPOSURE WE NEED THOSE PANDAS WILL BE WITH US FOR A LONG TIME
FRED THOUGHT ABOUT IT YOU KNOW I THINK WE SHOULD RENAME YIN YIN COLUMBUS
THE ZOO KEEPER SAID GOOD HEAVENS MAN THAT IS A GREAT IDEA
NOW NO WAIT A SECOND I DON'T UNDERSTAND
WELL SIR WHEN COLUMBUS SET
SIL
OUT ON HIS SHIP HE WAS REALLY TRYING TO FIND A QUICK QUICKER WAY TO GET AROUND EUROPE IN ORDER TO IMPROVE TRADE
HE WANTED TO BE A BUSINESS MAN BUT INSTEAD BECAME BECAME A GREAT EXPLORER
YES BUT WHAT DOES THAT HAVE TO DO WITH THE PANDAS NA PANDAS PANDAS MAN SAID THE ZOO MANAGER
WELL IT SEEMS TO ME SIR THAT YIN YIN WANTED TO BE A GREAT EXPLORER AND INSTEAD BECAME A BUSINESS WOMAN
I SEE FRED ONE MORNING ONE MORE THING SIR
SIL
ABOUT THOSE MAGPIES FLYING ABOVE THE PANDAS DO YOU THINK THAT THE ZOO COULD PURCHASE ME A LARGE SIZE UMBRELLA
THE ZOO MANAGER LAUGHED AND WALKED AWAY BUT DID PURCHASE A FASHIONABLE YELLOW UMBRELLA FOR FRED THE NEXT DAY
BACK IN THE PANDA'S HOME THE MOTHER PANDA POO POO WAS VERY PROUD OF HER DAUGHTER AFTER ALL
SIL
IF IT WEREN'T FOR YIN YIN THEY WOULD HAVE HAD TO MOVE FROM THEIR WONDERFUL HOME
<br> BUT LATER WHEN FRED WALKED INTO THE PANDA'S HOME UNDER HIS NEW
SIL
YELLOW UMBRELLA ALL SHE COULD THINK OF WAS NONSENSE
AS FOR YIN YIN SHE WAS VERY PROUD TO BE RENAMED AFTER A FAMOUS EXPLORER <unk> AND SHE AND MAGPIE NEVER STOPPED TRYING TO GET TO THE MOON
THE PANDA IS ABOUT THIS <unk>
SIL
OK UHM THE PANDA THE STORY OF THE PANDA IS ABOUT A PANDA NAMED YIN YIN AND HER FRIEND UHM MAGPIE AND THEY WANT TO GO TO THE MOON
AND SO THEY MADE THIS ROCKETSHIP OUT OF BAMBOO AND MAGPIE HAD TO COLLECT UHM <br> I THINK IT WAS TWO THOUSAND UHM SEVENTY FIVE MAGPIES TO CARRY THE BAMBOO ROCKET AND THE PANDA TO GO TO THE MOON
AND THEY FOUND OUT THAT THAT MANY MAGPIES KEEP FIGHTING AND THEY NEVER AGREE SO THAT DIDN'T WORK
AND THE ZOOKEEPER <br> UHM <br> HIS NAME WAS FRED
WHEN HE WENT INTO THE CAGE TO FEED THE PANDA'S HE WOULD GET ALL WARM INSIDE AND HE WASN'T ALLOWED TO HUG THE PANDA'S SO HE'D RUN OUTSIDE AND HUG A PALM TREE
OUTSIDE THE CAGE AND SINCE UH THE PANDA AND HER FRIEND THE MAGPIE BUILT THE ROCKETSHIP THE <br> UHM PER
THE ZOO KEPT GETTING MORE MONEY AND SO THE FRED UHM <br> LET'S SEE SO AND FRED DECIDED WELL MAYBE WE CAN GET EVEN MORE PEOPLE IF WE RENAME THE PANDA'S NAME COLOMBUS
UHM F RENAME IT COLUMBUS AND SO THEY NAMED YIN YIN THE PANDA COLUMBUS BECAUSE THEY THOUGHT THAT COLUMBUS WOULD BE A GOOD NAME FROM COLUMBUS THE EXPLORER
BECAUSE THEY WERE TRYING TO MAKE A ROCKETSHIP AND GO TO THE MOON AND TRYING TO EXPLORE
SIL
BUT AND SHE DIDN'T WANT HER TO BE AN EXPLORER
UP IN AND SHE DIDN'T WANT HER TO GO TO THE MOON
AND THE DAD WAS SORT OF SUPPORTIVE OF HIS DAUGHTERS IDEAS BUT HE WAS ALWAYS SLEEPING AND SO
THE RED LEAVES WERE BLOWN AROUND IN MILLIONS BY THE WIND
BEHIND LAY THE SHIP A PICTURE NO NOT WITHOUT HIS LIGHTER SIDE
AND MEANWHILE BY THE FURTHER RIVER BANK CAME ROSALIND WITH MUSHROOMS IN HER SKIRT
NOW GO AND ANSWER YOUR NOTE AND LET ME FINISH THIS SPLENDID <unk> STORY
MORE COURAGE THAN MY POOR BROTHER WHO STANDS LIKE A COWARD
SHE RUSHED FRANTICALLY ACROSS THE APARTMENT SEIZED HER HOOD AND RAN FROM THE COTTAGE
SIL
THEY CARRY THEMSELVES AS FAST AS THEY HAD BEEN DRILLED BOTH MEN AND WOMEN
I FEAR THAT WE SHALL HAVE ANOTHER SMART GALE HOWEVER IT WON'T LAST LONG
THE DAY ETHEL BROWN WAS SEVEN YEARS OLD SHE HAD A TEA PARTY
<br>
OF COURSE THERE'S NOTHING VERY ENTERTAINING HERE FOR YOU
THE YOUNGER LINGERED FOR THE MOMENT OR TWO WATCHING MYLES AT WORK
THESE WORDS QUITE DESTROYED THE HOPE THAT OF THE LATE HAD BEEN GROWING WITHIN HER
ITS FLAVOR WHEN COOKED IS MORE EXQUISITE <unk> FAR THAN MOTION OR OYSTERS OR EGGS
I'M EAST EARNEST HUCK AS EARNEST AS EVER I WAS IN MY LIFE
HUMOR SAID PATHOS <unk> MAKE IT LIVE AND YOU HAVE FOUND YOUR STYLE AT LAST
SEAGRAVE KNELT BY HIS SIDE TOOK HIS HAND AND BURST INTO TEARS
NAN SAID IT WOULDN'T GROW IN OUR GARDEN BUT I BROUGHT SOME HOME TO TRY
HIS BOOTS CREAKED TOO SO LOUDLY BUT STILL HE WAS NOT AFRAID AT ALL
SHE WILL BE GLAD TO SEE YOU BUT HIS BUT SHE HAS BEEN VERY BADLY FRIGHTENED
HE TURNED HIS BACK ON THE BOY AND CONFERRED <unk> ASIDE WITH LAWRENCE
I DES <unk> DESIRED IT SO MUCH THAT I WOULD TAKE NO REFUSAL
AND THE PRIZE CUP GREW CLEARER AND NEARER TO HER METAL VISION
SIL
SIL
ROOSTER JOHN
BEFORE I TELL YOU HOW THE ROOSTER JOHN GOT HIS NAME YOU SHOULD KNOW A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE TOWN FRANKSVILLE
FRANKSVILLE WAS A TOWN THAT SEEMED TO HAVE ONE PROBLEM AFTER ANOTHER
THE PROBLEM STARTED WHEN THEY RAN OUT OF WATER THANKFULLY SOMEONE WAS DIGGING A HOLE AND FOUND
SIL
THEY GOT TONS AND TONS OF FLIES
THEN THE FLIES STOPPED BUT JUST THEN A MAN MOVED INTO
SIL
TOWN WHO PLAYED THE FLUTE SO BADLY THAT PEOPLE WOULD RUN AWAY SCREAMING
<br>
MAYBE A POORLY P PLAYED FLUTE DOESN'T SOUND ALL THAT BAD BUT JUST TRYING TO IMAGE SOMEONE SCREACHING AN A CHALKBOARD WITH A FORK AND THEN MULTIPLY THAT A HUNDRED T TIMES A HUNDRED
THAT'S HOW THE FLUTE SOUNDED WHEN IT WHEN THIS GUY PLAYED IT
I'M SERIOUS STILL IT'S NOT A BAD AS BAD AS MILLIONS OF FLIES I SUPPOSE
<br> THE BAD FLUTE PLAYER WAS ROOSTER JOHN HE WASN'T CALLED ROOSTER JOHN YET
<br>
THAT CAME LATER HE JUST NEW
SIL
NEW TOWN DENTIST
HE WAS EX AN EXCELLENT DENTIST BUT REAL LOVE WAS MUSIC
HE PLAYED MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS SUCH AS THE GUITAR THE TUBA THE PIANO AND THE CLARINET
HOWEVER FOR SOME REASON THE WAY HIS MOUTH WAS SHAPED MADE HIS FLUTE SOUND AWFUL
SIL
WE CAN'T LET YOU PLAY WITH THE FLUTE ANYMORE JOHN SAID THE POLICE CHIEF SANDERS
THE NEIGHBORS ARE COMPLAINING AND THE CATS AND DOGS ARE TRYING TO CHEW OFF THEIR EARS
BUT I HAVE TO PLAY I WAS BORN TO DO IT I KNOW WHY BUT I FEEL LIKE I HAVE TO OR ELSE BAD THINGS WILL HAPPEN
LOOK JOHN I'VE HEARD YOU PLAY THE CLARINET YOU QUI YOU'RE QUITE GOOD WHY DON'T YOU PLAY THE THAT INSTEAD THE CHIEF S SAID CHIEF SANDERS
OH THAT'S NICE INSTRUMENT BUT THAT'S NOT THE FLUTE
I EVEN WROTE A SONG
SIL
CHIEF SANDERS I CALLED IT COPS AND ROBBERS
THEN HE PLAYED THE SONG THE POLICE CHIEF HATED THE SOUND SO MUCH THAT HE THREW JOHN IN JAIL BUT HE COULDN'T KEEP JOHN IN JAIL SINCE HE WAS ALREADY BREAKING ANY LAWS
SO THERE WAS NOTHING THE POLICE COULD DO BESIDES EVERYBODY LOVED JOHN SINCE HE HAD BECOME THE TOWN DENTIST EVERYBODY'S TEETH WERE MUCH WHITER AND CLEANER AND NO ONE HAD ANY CAVITIES
<br> SO THERE WAS A PROBLEM IN THE T LITTLE TOWN OF FRANKSVILLE
WHAT WOULD THEY DO THEY COULDN'T KEEP JOHN IN JAIL AND THEY COULDN'T WANT TO KICK HIM OUT OF THE TOWN BECAUSE THEY ALL HAD SUCH NICE TEETH
SO THEY DECIDED THAT JOHN COULD PLAY THE FLUTE AND EVERYBODY ELSE WOULD HAVE TO WEAR EARPLUGS
WELL I'M SURE YOU GUESSED THAT IT DIDN'T WORK SO NO ONE COULD HEAR ANYTHING
PEOPLE WERE GETTING INTO CARS CAR ACCIDENTS AND EVERYBODY LOOKED REALLY SILLY AT DANCES DANCING TO MUSIC THEY COULDN'T HEAR THEY JUST COULDN'T
SIL
LEAD A NORMAL LI LIFE
<br> THEN THEY DECIDED TO LOWER HIM DOWN A WELL <unk> LET HIM PLAY WHERE THERE WERE NO ONE COULD HEAR HIM
JOHN THOUGHT HE WAS ASK AN OK IDEA BUT THE LOUDER THE ECHO THAT WELL MADE THE FLUTE SOUNDED LOUDER
WINDOWS WERE BREAKING AND ALL THE COWS IN THE TOWN STARTED TO MAKE SOUR MILK
THOUGH LOCAL DENTIST DOCTOR WRONG CAME UP WITH AN IDEA HE TAUGHT HE THOUGHT THAT IF HE MADE A NEW MOUTHPIECE ESPECIALLY SHAPED FOR JOHN'S MOUTH THEN PERHAPS HE COULD PLAY THE FLUTE NORMALLY
AND GUESS WHAT IT WORKED DOCTOR WONG IN THE TOWN HERO
THE FLUTE SOUNDED NORMAL AND IT TURNED OUT JOHN COULD PLAY IT QUITE WELL
THE PEOPLE IN FRANKTOWN DECIDED TO HAVE A GREAT BIG PARADE IN FRANKVILLE SO CELEBRATED IN FACT FOR ONCE THERE WAS NO WATER PROBLEM NO NO FLY PROBLEM AND NO FLUTE PROBLEM
DOCTOR WONG AND JOHN WERE STARS OF THE PARADE
THEY WERE UP IN THE MAIN FLOAT AS BIG BAND PLAYED AS THEY MARCHED UP AND DOWN MAIN STREET
EVERYONE CHEERED
<br>
THEN SUDDENLY A FLY LANDED ON A LITTLE GIRL THEN A FLY LANDED ON SOMEONE ELSE THEN SOME LANDED ON A BUNCH OF PEOPLE
IT WAS PRETTY SOON THERE WERE TONS OF FLIES LANDING ON EVERYONE FOR THEY KNEW IT
SIL
BUT THE TOWN WAS FILLED WITH FLIES AGAIN
SIL
OH NO SAID THE CHIEF SANDERS JUST WHEN THINGS WERE GOING GOOD FOR FRANKSVILLE
SIL
JOHN DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO SO HE KEPT PLAYING HIS FLUTE
THE FLIES WERE ANNOYING SO HE WOULD SWAT THEM WITH HIS HAND OR EVEN A F HIS NEW FLUTE
HE STARTED SHAKING THE FLUTE TO GET THE FLIES OFF AND ACCIDENTALLY SMASHED INTO PIECES
HE WAS VERY UPSET AT FIRST THEN HE SAID OH WELL GOT GOOD THING I BROUGHT MY OLD FLUTE BACK UP
NO NO PLEASE DON'T PLAY THE OLD FLUTE BEGGED DOCTOR WONG
THEY HAD TO COVER THEIR EARS FROM THE HORRIBLE SOUND
THE FLIES WOULD LAND ALL OVER THE PEOPLE THEY COULDN'T SWAT THEM OFF IT WAS GROSS
THEN SUDDENLY THE FLIES FLEW AWAY AS FAST AS THEY COULD
DOCTOR WONG THOUGHT FOR A SECOND THEN PRONOUNCED IT'S THE FLUTE SOUND THE FLIES HATE JOHN'S FLUTE PLAYING HAS MUCH AS WE DO
JOHN THE DENTIST WAS TRYING TO DRIVING THE FLIES AWAY
IT WAS THEN <unk> THAT PEOPLE OF FRANKSVILLE REALIZED THAT THEY WOULDN'T HAVE TO TAKE GOD GOOD WITH THEM THE BAD
BECAUSE AS BAD AS THE FLUTE SOUNDED IT WAS A LOT BETTER THAN THOUSANDS OF FLIES CRAWLING ON THEM FROM
SIL
THEN ON JOHN WOULD WAKE UP AT SUNRISE LIKE A ROOSTER AND PLAY TO KEEP THE FLIES AWAY
SIL
OK SO THE STORY WAS MAINLY ABOUT TH THIS GUY NAMED JOHN AND HIS FLUTE
BUT WHEN HE PLAYED IT IT SOUNDED REALLY BAD SO BUT THERE WAS ALL THESE PROBLEMS LIKE THERE WAS NO WATER FLIES WERE WERE WAS TONS OF FLIES EVERYWHERE
AND SO THEN HE
SIL
PLAYED HIS FLUTE AND IT'D DRIVE THEM AWAY AND THEN HE GOT A NEW FLUTE SO IT DIDN'T SOUND AS BAD AND THE FLIES LIKED IT SO THEY CAME BACK
BUT THEN HE HIS FLUTE BROKE TRYING TO SWAT FLIES IN THE PARADE
SO HE UHM WAS LUCKY THAT HE BROUGHT HIS OTHER FLUTE AND HE PLAYED IT AND DRIVES ALL THOSE FLIES AWAY
THAT'S PRETTY MUCH WHAT IT'S ABOUT
SIL
THEY TRIED TO GET EARPLUGS SO THEY COULDN'T HEAR IT BUT THEN THERE'S CAR ACCIDENTS AND PEOPLE WERE GETTING HURT AND SO DOCTOR WONG TRIED TO HE MADE A NEW FLUTE
FOR HIM AND IT DIDN'T SOUND BAD
SIL
AND THE POLICE CHIEF DIDN'T LIKE IT SO HE THREW HIM IN JAIL BUT HE HAD TO TAKE HIM OUT CAUSE HE WASN'T DISOBEYING ANY LAWS SO HE TOOK HIM OUT
OK THE EARL'S NEXT SPEECH DASHED THAT HOPE INTO A THOUSAND FRAGMENTS
SIL
GRACIOUS AIN'T THAT A LOT OF AW AN AWFUL LOT OF MONEY EXCLAIMED DAVY CROCKETT
SIL
THIS LITTLE JOHN DID THOUGH WITHOUT DISTURBING HIS MASTER OR RISING FROM WHERE HE SAT
SIL
THE NEXT MOMENT HE CHANGED THE SUBJECT BECAUSE IT SEEMED THE BEST THING TO DO
HARRISON CHUCKLED IF HE CHUCKLED AT ALL IN PRIVATE IT WAS ALL SYMPATHY OUTWARDLY
SIL
HEARING THESE WORDS JIM RESOLVED TO CONQUER HIS ALARM BY HIMSELF
SIL
THE WOMEN REPLIED ONLY BY VANISHING AS THOUGH SUDDENLY MIXED WITH THE AIR
THEN HE SEEMED TO BREATHE MORE FREELY AND RECOVERED FROM HI RECOVERED SOME OF HIS JAUNTY IMPUDENCE <unk>
SIL
THEN THE ROPES WERE ATTACHED AND EVERYBODY PULLED VIGOROUSLY
SIL
NOT EVEN HER WRATH AT THE GIRL'S INSOLENCE COULD WHOLLY OVERCOME HER WONDER
SIL
THE MISTRESS STOOD STOCK STILL HOLDING HER HANDS AT A LEVEL WITH HER THROAT
SIL
SHE HAD LOOSENED THE LID AND THEN SHE LAUGHINGLY SAT ON IT
I SHOULD THINK YOU HAD AN IMAGINATION SURE ENOUGH SHE LAUGHED
I SWORE TO BRING YOU THE TERRIBLE HEAD AND SEE HOW I KEEP MY OATH

SIL

SIL

SIL
DUSKY CRIMSON RUSHED MADLY OVER THE BOY'S FACE
SIL

SIL
ALL NIGHT THE BLIZZARD RAGED AND IN THE MORNING THE PLAINS WERE WHITE WITH SNOW
ISN'T HE KNOWN AS THE MOST BRILLIANT JOURNALIST IN NEW YORK
WHY I'M HARDLY ACQUAINTED WITH YOU CRIED ANNE INDIGNANTLY
SIL
SIL
SIL
NOW ALL THE PEOPLE REJOICED BECAUSE THE WICKED KING SHOULD RULE THEM NO LONGER
SIL
THE PANDA
SIL
WHY DID A PANDA WITH THE BEAUTIFUL GIRL NAME YIN YIN HAVE HER NAME CHANGED TO THE VERY UN BEAUTIFUL GIRL NAME COLUMBUS
<br> IT WAS FRED'S IDEA SO LET'S BEGIN WITH FRED
FRED FED THE PANDA BEARS THE TIGERS AND THE TURTLES
THE TURTLES WEREN'T SO BAD BUT AS FOR THE TIGERS HE WASN'T SO SURE
HE DIDN'T MIND HANDLING THE RAW MEAT HE HAD TO FEED TH TO THE TIGERS
HIS MAIN OBJECTION WAS BE TO BEING EATEN
SIL
NO ONE COULD BLAME FRED REALLY SINCE NO ONE REALLY WANTS TO BE EATEN
SOME PEOPLE DO LIKE TO BITE THEIR FINGER NAILS BUT FRED WASN'T A NAIL BITER SO BEING EATEN WAS DEFINITELY NOT SOMETHING HE LOOKED FORWARD TO
SIL
FRED WAIT EACH AFTERNOON AT THREE O'CLOCK WHEN IT WAS TIME TO FEED THE TIGERS
<unk> FOR FRED WHEN IT CAME TO THE PANDAS HE HAD A WARM SPOT IN HIS HEART
ACTUALLY IT WAS EIGHTY FIVE POINT FIVE DEGREE SPOT ON HIS LEFT KIDNEY BUT THE POINT WAS THAT HE WAS VERY FOND OF FEEDING THE PANDAS
THERE WERE THREE PANDAS AND THEY WERE KNOWN AS THE PAN FAMILY
THERE WERE THEY WERE IN ORDER OF CUTENESS YIN YIN THE YOUNGER DAUGHTER POO POO THE MOTHER AND MOO MAN THE GENTLE AND ALWAYS SLEEPY FATHER
SIL
MANY PEOPLE KNOW THE THAT PANDAS EAT BAMBOO A LOT OF IT AND A LOT OF BAMBOO CAN GET QUITE HEAVY
SO BECAUSE OF THE PANDAS FRED BECAME VERY STRONG AND WAS IN TERRIFIC SHAPE
<unk> BUT PHYSICAL FITNESS WAS NOT ONLY THE ONLY REASON THAT FRED LOVED THE PANDAS
THE OTHER REASON WAS THAT ANYONE WHO GETS WITHIN THREE FEET OF A PANDA AUTOMATICALLY FALLS IN LOVE WITH THEM IT'S A LAW OF NATURE
AS AT FUTHER DISTANCES PANDAS HAVE A STRANGE ALMOST MAGICAL EFFECT ON HUMAN BEINGS WHICH MAKES US WANT TO HUG AND SQUEEZE THINGS
FRED WAS NOT ALLOWED TO ACTUALLY HUG THE PANDA BEARS SINCE THAT COULD BE DANGEROUS
SO ALL THE OTHER PEOPLE IN THE ZOO WOULD KNOW THAT THE PANDAS HAD JUST BEEN FED WHEN THEY SAW FRED HUGGING THE RATHER UNCUDDLY PALM TREE OUTSIDE THE PANDAS HOME
<br> IT'S INTERESTING TO POINT OUT AT THIS TIME THAT MORE STUFFED PANDA BEARS ARE SOLD AT ZOO GIFT SHOPS THAN ALL OF THE OTHER STUFFED ANIMALS COMBINED
THIS CAN ALMOST CERTAINLY BE ACCOUNTED FOR BY THE STRANGE ALMOST MAGICAL EFFECT THAT THE PANDAS POSSESS
BUT EVERYTHING WAS NOT ALL BAMBOO AND HUGS AT THE ZOO
ONE MORNING FRED WAS FEEDING YIN YIN AND SAID OH YIN YIN I WISH THAT MORE PEOPLE WOULD COME AND VISIT THE ZOO
I KNOW I SHOULDN'T BE TELLING YOU THIS BUT WE MIGHT HAVE TO SELL YOU AND YOUR FAMILY TO THE BIG ZOO IN SAN SAN ANGELES IF WE DON'T GET MORE MONEY
IT'S NOT THAT YOU AREN'T SELLING ENOUGH STUFFED PANDA BEARS IT'S JUST THAT YOU HAVEN'T BEEN THERE HAVEN'T BEEN ENOUGH PEOPLE COMING TO SEE YOU IN THE FIRST PLACE
I THINK THAT THE ZOO NEEDS A GREAT ADVERTISING CAMPAIGN
SIL
FRED WAS STARTING TO FEEL THE UNCONTROLLABLE URGE TO HUG THE PANDA SO BEFORE HE RAN OFF TO HUG THE PALM TREE HE QUICKLY SAID
IT COSTS SO MUCH TO FEED YOU PANDA BEARS I WOULD HA I W I WOULD HATE IF YOU HAD TO LEAVE US
SIL
AFTER ALL IT'S ONLY HOME YOU KNOW IT'S THE ONLY HOME YOU KNOW
BESIDES IF YOU LEAVE I'LL GET TERRIBLY OUT OF SHAPE NOW IF YOU EXCUSE ME I NEED TO SQUEEZE SOMETHING BEFORE I SCREAM
BUT YIN YIN THE YOUNG PANDA WAS NOT LISTENING TO FRED SHE WAS TALKING TO HER BEST FRIEND MAGGIE THE MAGPIE ABOUT GOING TO THE MOON
YES THE BIG ONE IN THE SKY THAT IS MOST LIKELY NOT MADE OF CHEESE AND MOST CERTAINLY NOT MADE OF BAMBOO
YIN YIN AND HER BEST FRIEND MAGGIE THE MAGPIE WHO LOOKED A LOT LIKE A PANDA WOULD LOOK WOULD LOOK IF PANDAS WERE BIRDS WERE DISCUSSING ABOUT GOING TO THE MOON
HER MOTHER AND FATHER KNEW WHAT THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT SINCE THEY HADN'T THOUGHT OR TALKED OF MUCH ELSE SINCE YIN YIN SAID I WANT TO GO THERE AND POINTED TO THE MOON
ENOUGH OF THIS NONSENSE SAID YIN YIN'S MOTHER POO POO WHAT SORT OF NONSENSE IS THIS FOR A YOUNG PANDA BEAR GOING TO THE MOON INDEED MOON INDEED
NONSENSE
SIL
YOUR JOB IS TO BE CUTE SO PEOPLE WANT TO RUN TO THE GIFT SHOP AND BUY PANDA BEAR DOLLS
IT'S SIMPLE ECON ECONOMICS
<unk>
LIKE IT OR NOT WE ARE SPOKESPEOPLE FOR THE PANDA STUFFED ANIMAL INDUSTRY WHICH YOUNG LADY HELPS PAY FOR THE BAMBOO THAT YOU EAT
SUCH NONSENSE GOING TO THE MOON SAID HER MOTHER POO POO
<unk> BUT I JUST LEARNED HOW TO MAKE MYSELF INTO A BALL AND ROLL TWO DAYS AGO AND I'VE BECOME VERY AND I'M BECOMING VERY GOOD AT IT
I DON'T THINK IT WILL TAKE THAT LONG TO ROLL THERE SAID YIN YIN
YIN YIN'S FATHER MOO MAN DIDN'T THINK IT WAS VERY PROPER OR WISE FOR A YOUNG PANDA BEAR TO GO ROLLING OFF TO PLACES WHERE THERE WASN'T ANY BAMBOO
BUT HE WAS SUPPORTIVE OF HIS YOUNG DAUGHTER AND SHOWED SUPPORT BY TAKING A NAP
BUT BEFORE HE FELL ASLEEP HE DID MANAGE TO SAY I BELIEVE ROLLING IS DECIDEDLY ROUND ABOUT WAY TO GO IF YOU MUST GO T'WOULD BE NICE TO BE IT T'WOULD BE BEST TO FLY
NONSENSE SAID THE MOTHER I'M SO MAD I'M GOING TO LOOK AT THE LADY OVER THERE AND MAKE HER WANT TO SQUEEZE HER SON CHEEKS SHE SAID SPITEFULLY
AN INSTANT LATER A YOUNG BOY HEARD WAS HEARD SAYING OUCH MOM CUT THAT OUT
I'M SORRY TO SAY BUT MANY A BOY LITTLE BOY'S CHEEKS HAVE BEEN MADE RAW WHEN MOTHER POO POO PANDA WAS UPSET
<br> YIN YIN HAS WAS ALWAYS ONE TO TAKE GOOD ADVICE FROM HER FATHER
SIL
AND LESS THAN A WEEK LATER YIN YIN AND MAGGIE HAD BUILT A ROCKET SHIP OUT OF BAMBOO
BAMBOO IS VERY WORKABLE SUBSTANCE AND PANDAS TEND TO HANDLE BAMBOO A LOT SO THIS IN ITSELF WAS NOT THAT ASTONISHING <unk> AT LEAST TO YIN YINS PARENTS FRED SURE WAS IMPRESSED THOUGH
THE MAIN OBSTACLE IT TURNS OUT WAS GETTING THE ROCKET SHIP OFF THE GROUND
MAGGIE FIGURED IF SHE AND THE THREE OF HER STRONGEST MAGPIE FRIENDS WERE TO EACH GRAB HOLD OF A CORNER OF THE ROCKET SHIP THEY COULD ALL FLY TO THE MOON SO THEY TRIED
ONE TWO THREE TO THE MOON THEY SAID TOGETHER PULLING WITH ALL THEIR MIGHT
I SEE YOUR WINGS FLAPPING BUT WE DON'T SEEM TO BE GOING ANYWHERE SAID YIN YIN
HMM HEAVIER THAN I THOUGHT I THINK WE'LL NEED MORE MAGPIES SAID MAGGIE
YES BUT HOW MANY MORE YIN YIN SAID
SIL
I'M NOT SURE EXACTLY REPLIED MAGGIE
THE FATHER WATCHING THIS ALL THROUGH ONE EYE FOR HE ALWAYS HAD AT LEAST ONE EYE UHM ONE EYE ASLEEP AT ALL TIMES SAID T'WOULD BE BEST TO ASK THE OWL THEN CLOSED HIS EYE
SO MAGGIE FLEW TO THE OWL ASKED FOR HIS ADVICE
OH WISE OWL I HAVE A QUESTION THAT I FEAR ONLY YOU CAN ANSWER SHE SAID
NO HOW MANY MAGPIE'S WOULD BE NEEDED TO FLY A FOUR HUNDRED POUND PANDA BEAR TO AND A ONE HUNDRED POUND BAMBOO ROCKET SHIP TO THE MOON SAID MAGGIE
THE OWL INSTANTLY REPLIED TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND AND SEVENTY SIX GIVE OR TAKE TWO
A WEEK LATER MAGGIE MANAGED TO ROUND UP TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND SEVENTY EIGHT MAGPIE SHE COULD BE VERY PERSUASIVE LITTLE BIRD IF SHE WANTED
SIL
A WEEK LATER DESPITE MUCH FLAPPING THEY WERE STILL TRYING TO GET THE ROCKET IN THE AIR
IT TURNS OUT THAT THE OWL DIDN'T TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION THAT ONCE YOU GET OVER A THOUSAND MAGPIE TOGETHER THEY TEND TO FIGHT AND CAN'T AGREE ON A SINGLE THING
NOW WHILE ALL THIS WAS GOING ON WHAT DO YOU SUPPOSE FRED WAS DOING WHY HE WAS FEEDING THE PANDAS LIKE HE WAS SUPPOSED TO
SO ONE DAY AFTER FRED HAD FED THE PANDAS AND WAS HUGGING THE PALM TREE THE ZOO MANAGER CAME UP TO HIM AND SAID WHAT IS GOING ON WITH YOUR PANDA FRED I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT
IT'S TAKEN ME A COUPLE OF WEEKS TO FIGURE IT OUT BUT I THINK YIN YIN WANTS TO GO TO THE MOON AND THE MAGPIES WANT TO TAKE HER THERE SAID FRED
OH WELL THAT MAKES SENSE THEN SAID THE MANAGER DID YOU KNOW THAT SINCE THE LITTLE PANDA BUILT THAT BAMBOO ROCKET SHIP THOSE MAGPIE'S STARTED FLUTTERING ABOUT AND THE ZOO'S PROFITS HAVE GONE UP FOUR THOUSAND PERCENT
THIS IS JUST THE TYPE OF EXPOSURE WE NEEDED THOSE PANDAS WILL BE WITH US FOR A LONG TIME
SIL
FRED THOUGHT ABOUT IT AND SAID YOU KNOW I THINK WE SHOULD RENAME YIN YIN COLUMBUS
THE ZOO KEEPER SAID GOOD HEAVENS TH THAT IS A GREAT IDEA NO WAIT A SECOND I DON'T UNDERSTAND
WELL SIR WHEN COLUMBUS SET OUT ON HIS SHIP HE WAS REALLY TRYING TO FIND A QUICKER WAY TO GET AROUND EUROPE IN ORDER TO IMPROVE TRADE HE WANTED TO BE A BUSINESS MAN BUT INSTEAD BECAME A GREAT EXPLORER
YES BUT WHAT DOES THAT HAVE TO DO WITH THE PANDAS MAN SAID THE ZOO KEEP MANAGER
WELL IT SEEMS TO ME SIR THAT YIN YIN WANTED TO BE A GREAT EXPLORER INSTEAD OF A BUSINESS WOMAN
I SEE FRED ONE MORE THING SIR ABOUT THOSE MAGPIES FLYING ABOVE THE PANDAS DO YOU THINK THAT THE ZOO COULD PURCHASE ME A LARGE SIZED UMBRELLA
BACK AT THE PANDA'S HOME THE MOTHER PANDA POO POO WAS VERY PROUD OF HER DAUGHTER AFTER ALL IF IT WEREN'T FOR YIN YIN THEY WOULD HAVE HAD TO MOVE FROM THEIR WONDERFUL HOME
BUT LATER WHEN FRED WALKED INTO THE PANDA'S HOME UNDER A HIS NEW YELLOW UMBRELLA ALL SHE COULD THINK WAS TO SAY WAS NONSENSE
<br> AS FOR YIN YIN SHE WAS VERY PROUD TO BE RENAMED AFTER A FAMOUS EXPLORER AND SHE AND MAGGIE NEVER STOPPED TRYING TO GET TO THE MOON
OK WELL UHM THERE'S THREE PANDA'S A FAMILY OF PANDA THERE'S THE DAD AND THE MOM AND THE LITTLE GIRL NAMED YIN YIN AND SHE WANTS TO GO TO THE MOON
SIL
AND HER BEST FRIEND IS A MAGPIE AND THEY TRY TO GO TO THE MOON AND THEY BUILD A ROCKETSHIP OUT OF BAMBOO BUT THEY CAN'T REALLY GET TO THE MOON AND THEN THEY HAVE TO GET A WHOLE BUNCH MORE OF THE MAGPIES AND THEY STILL CAN'T GET TO THE MOON
BUT THE PROBLEM WAS THE PANDA'S WERE TRYING THEY WERE THEY THE PEOPLE WERE T NOT COMING TO THE ZOO SORT OF AND SO THEY WANTED TO THEY MIGHT HAVE TO GET RID OF THE PANDA'S AND SEND THEM TO A BIGGER ZOO
BECAUSE THEY WEREN'T MAKING ENOUGH OF A PROFIT
AND THE KEEPER FOR THE PANDA'S WAS FRED AND HE DIDN'T WANT THAT TO HAPPEN AND SO HE HE HE KIND OF LIKED THAT THEY WERE DOING THAT AND SO YIN YIN DECIDED TO DO THAT AND
SHE'S STILL TRYING BUT SHE CAN'T REALLY GET TO THE MOON
BUT IT DID INCREASE THE POPULARITY
SO LOTS MORE PEOPLE COMING NOW AND SO THEY COULD KEEP THE PANDA BEARS
SIL
AND THAT'S ABOUT IT
SIL
OKAY FRED HE WAS THE ZOO KEEPER FOR THEM HE ALSO TOOK CARE OF THE TIGERS AND ONE OTHER ANIMAL THAT I FORGOT
AND HE UHM LIKED THE PANDA'S THE BEST THOUGH
BUT WHENEVER HE GOT CLOSE TO THEM HE WANTED TO HUG THEM SO HE'D HAVE TO GO AWAY REALLY QUICK
AND HUG THE PALM TREE OUTSIDE OF THEIR CAGES AND SO IT MUST HAVE LOOKED KIND OF WEIRD
AND HE REALLY LIKED THE PANDA'S AND
SIL
HE GOT REALLY REALLY STRONG FROM CARRYING THEIR BAMBOO CAUSE IT WEIGHED A LOT
AND THEY HAD TO EAT A LOT OF IT SO HE GOT REALLY STRONG CARRYING ALL THEIR BAMBOO AND SO HE'S REALLY FIT
SIL
I THINK I SEE PEARLS AND DIAMONDS COME OUT OF THE GIRL'S MOUTH
WHAT IF HE HAD BRAINS AND MILITARY SKILLS AND ALL THAT SORT OF THING
SIL
SIL
YES SAID ANNE CANDIDLY <unk> I'VE HEARD THAT YOU AND HE WERE ENGAGED ONCE
SIL
HE HAD GENTLE AND REFINED FEATURES AND HIS VOICE WAS SOFT AND PLEASANT IN TONE
SIL
ONE WOULD SUPPOSE THAT THEY KNEW NOTHING AT ALL ABOUT SCHOOL AFFAIRS BUT THEY DO
IT WAS A DEEP DAZZLING LOVELY BLUE DEEPER THAN THE DEEPEST BLUE OF THE S OF THE SKY
SIL
AT PRACTICALLY
SIL
THE SAME INSTANT THE THIRD SHOT WHISTLED FROM THE EAST
SIL
A SHADOW THAT CHILLED HIS HEART SEEMED GRADUALLY TO FALL UPON HIM
SIL
IT NEVER OCCURRED TO HIM THAT SHE MIGHT BE CH SHE MIGHT BE CHANGED HERSELF
SIL
GOOD FRIEND SAID THE OTHER GENTLY I HAVE BUSINESS ELSEWHERE

SIL

SIL
SIL
BUT I'M AWFULLY HUNGRY I WISH YOU'D GET ME SOMETHING TO EAT
SIL
MARCO ONLY STOOD QUITE QUIET STILL AND LOOKED AT HIM WITH UNDERSTANDING AND GRAVITY
SIL
THE AIRPLANE RIDE
THE FIRST TIME I EVER TOOK AN AIRPLANE BY MYSELF IT WAS FUN AND SCARY
I DIDN'T KNOW ANYONE AT ALL AND I HAD TO GO ALL THE WAY FROM NEW YORK TO TEXAS WITHOUT MY PARENTS
I WAS FLYING THERE TO SEE MY GRANDFATHER AND WE WERE GOING TO GO FISHING
<unk> I'VE ALWAYS THOUGHT FLYING WAS FUN YOU GO HIGHER THAN ANY MOUNTAIN AND YOU GO FASTER THAN ANY CAR
<unk> BUT I TELL YOU THE TRUTH WITHOUT MY PARENTS THERE I WAS PRETTY NERVOUS
I GUESS IT WAS BECAUSE THE PLANE WAS SO LOUD AND I DIDN'T KNOW ANYBODY OR ANYONE
I STARTED THINKING WE MIGHT CRASH I DIDN'T LIKE TO THINK ABOUT THAT BUT I COULDN'T HELP IT
THAT'S WHEN I MISSED MY PARENTS THE MOST BUT ONCE THE PLANE WAS IN THE AIR I WAS PRETTY GOOD
MY MOM GAVE ME A COLORING BOOK OF COOL LOOKING DRAGONS TO KEEP ME BUSY I COLORED THE DRAGON PICTURES ALL GREEN SO IT DIDN'T TAKE VERY LONG
I ONLY USED THE GREEN CRAYON BECAUSE IT WAS THE TALLEST AND I WANTED IT TO CATCH UP TO THE RED BROWN BLUE YELLOW PURPLE AND BLACK ONES
SIL
ONE THING ABOUT BEING BY YOURSELF ON YOUR ON AN AIRPLANE IS THAT THE FLIGHT ATTENDANTS ARE VERY NICE TO YOU
I HAD SEVEN COLAS AND FOUR GINGER ALES WHICH MADE ME HAVE TO GO TO THE BATHROOM EIGHT TIMES
I WAS GLAD THAT THERE WASN'T ANY ANYONE NEXT TO ME THE PERSON THAT SAT NEXT TO ME
SIL
WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY ANNOYED
SIL
EVENTUALLY THE FLIGHT ATTENDANT SEEMED TO GET A LITTLE ANNOYED THAT I HAD TO GO THE BATHROOM SO MUCH
BUT IT WAS HER FAULT <unk> SHE WAS THE ONE THAT KEPT TRYING TO GIVE ME PEANUTS
I TOLD HER THAT I WANTED A BANANA SPLIT INSTEAD BUT SHE SAID THEY DON'T HAVE ANY BANANA SPLITS ON THE PLANE
BUT SOMETIMES PEOPLE LIKE TO EAT PEANUTS ON THEIR BANANA SPLITS I TOLD HER THAT I WAS THAT THE PEANUTS THAT WERE MAKING ME SO THIRSTY IN THE FIRST PLACE
AND IF SHE WOULD GET ME A BANANA SPLIT I WOULD I WOULDN'T HAVE TO GO THE BATHROOM AS MUCH SO MUCH
SHE TOLD ME TO BE QUIET AND WATCH THE MOVIE
I TRIED TO WATCH THE MOVIE BUT I HAD ALREADY SEEN THAT ONE SO IT WAS BORING
THE FLIGHT ATTENDANT GAVE ME A DECK OF CARDS BUT SHE WOULDN'T PLAY GO FISH WITH ME
SIL
SHE SAID THAT SHE HAD TO HELP OTHER PASSENGERS
SIL
I HAD A GAME BOY IN MY BACKPACK MY BACKPACK WAS O IN THE OVERHEAD THINGY
I TRIED TO PUSH THE BUTTON THAT LIGHTS UP THE OVER HEAD SO THE FLIGHT ATTENDANT COULD WOULD COME
BUT I BUT GUESS WHAT I WAS TOO SHORT TO REACH THE BUTTON SO I STARED STARTED YELLING HEY PEANUT LADY HEY PEANUT LADY
SHE DIDN'T LIKE BEING CALLED PEANUT LADY BUT SHE DID GET ME THE GAME OR GET ME MY GAME BOY
SIL
SHE TOLD ME TO CALL HER JENNIFER INSTEAD I PLAYED ON MY GAME BOY UNTIL I GOT A NEW HIGH S MY NEW HIGH SCORE
THEN JENNIFER CAME UP TO ME AND SAID <unk> SHE HAD A SURPRISE I THOUGHT GREAT MORE PEANUTS BUT IT WASN'T PEANUTS IT WAS SOMETHING REALLY COOL
SHE SAID THE CAPTAIN WAS INVITING ME TO SEE THE COCKPIT I THOUGHT AWESOME <unk> I ALSO BROUGHT MY DECK OF CARDS IN CASE THE PILOT WAS BORED AND WANTED TO PLAY GO FISH
<br> JENNIFER TOOK ME TO THE COCKPIT AND THERE WERE
SIL
A MILLION BUTTONS AND LEVERS AND KNOBS AND STUFF
AT FIRST I THOUGHT WOW LOOK AT ALL THOSE BUTTONS THEN I THOUGHT THERE'S NO WAY THAT ANYONE CAN REMEMBER TO PUSH ALL THOSE BUTTONS AT THE RIGHT TIME ARE WE GOING TO CRASH
SIL
THE WAY I FIGURED IT MY GAME BOY OR THE WAY I FIGURED IT MY GAME BOY ONLY HAS FIVE BUTTONS AND I CAN GET PAST LEVEL THREE
IMAGINE HOW HARD IT WOULD BE TO WORK ALL THOSE MILLIONS OF BUTTONS AND EAT PEANUTS
THE PILOT TOLD ME THAT IT WASN'T REALLY THE HARD ONE HARD ONCE YOU PRACTICE
AND HE TOLD ME THAT HE W HE ONCE PLAYED A GAME I HAD ON MY GAME BOY
SIL
AND HE COULDN'T EVEN PASS LEVEL ONE I SAID
SIL
IF YOU CAN'T EVEN GET PAST LEVEL ONE AND YOU'RE A PILOT THEN I COULD BE A PILOT S TOO SINCE I'M MUCH BETTER AT PUSHING BUTTONS THAN YOU
HE LAUGHED EVEN THOUGH I WASN'T JOKING
HE SAID HE THOUGHT I WOULD MAKE A REALLY GREAT PILOT SOMEDAY IF I WANTED TO BE
SIL
IF I WANTED TO BE A PILOT
HE WAS REALLY NICE BUT HE WOULDN'T PLAY GO FISH WITH ME <unk>
FINALLY WE LANDED THAT'S ALWAYS SCARY IT SEEMS LIKE THE PLANE IS GOING TOO FAST TO EVER STOP BUT IT DOES
WHEN I GOT OFF THE AIRPLANE THERE WAS GRANDPA <unk> WAITING FOR ME HE SAID HOW WA HOW WAS YOUR FLIGHT
I SAID SOMEDAY I'M GOING TO BE A PILOT I'LL ONLY SERVE BANANA SPLITS ON MY PLANE
GRANDPA LAUGHED AND I TO AND I TOOK
SIL
IT AND TOOK ME STRAIGHT TO THE ICE CREAM SHOP
IT WAS WORTH THE THE WHOLE TRIP TO JUST EAT A BANANA SPLIT WITH GRANDPA
OK WELL I THINK IT'S ABOUT A LITTLE BOY MAYBE A LITTLE GIRL BECAUSE HE PLAYS A GAMEBOY OR SHE PLAYS A GAMEBOY
AND HE GOES TO SEE HIS GRANDPA
SIL
AND HE GETS KIND OF NERVOUS BECAUSE HE'S TAKING A PLANE BY HIMSELF AND HE GETS KIND OF USED TO IT AND
SIL
HE LANDS AND HE'S REALLY HAPPY TO SEE IS GRANDPA
SIL
AND THAT'S ABOUT IT
SIL
WELL HE PLAYED GAMEBOY AND
SIL
I DON'T KNOW IF HE PLAYED CARDS BUT IT DIDN'T SEEM LIKE HE PLAYED CARDS TI ATE PEANUTS AND TALKED WITH THE FLIGHT ATTENDANT A LITTLE BIT DRANK SODAS
SIL
WELL HE COLORED ALL THE PAGES GREEN BECAUSE HE WANTED HIS GREEN CRAYON WHICH WAS THE TALLEST CRAYON TO MATCH HIS OTHER CRAYONS AND SO ALL THE PAGES WITH DRAGONS WERE GREEN I GUESS
SIL
WELL I WOULD BE ANNOYED IF I WAS THE FLIGHT ATTTENDANT
BECAUSE I MEAN I COULDN'T EAT THAT MUCH PEANUTS I WOULD NOT WANT TO GIVE OUT THAT MUCH PEANUTS
AND IF THAT LITTLE BOY OR GIRL WAS ANNOYING ME THAT MUCH I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'D DO
SO I'D PROBABLY SAY THERE'S NO BANANA SPLITS ON THE PLANE EITHER IF THERE WAS STILL
<br> AFTER THE USUAL CEREMONIES THE PRINCE PRESENTED HIS PROPOSAL
RATHER I WOULD FACE THREE STRONG MEN THAN ONE YOUNG DAMSEL <unk>
I WOULD LOVE DEARLY TO HEAR THESE PEOPLE DESCRIBE THEIR TRAVELS
THROUGHOUT THESE CONVERSATIONS SAM HODGE SELDOM SPOKE
NOW HE HAS GONE OFF AGAIN FOR THE GAME IS GETTING SCARCE
YES MY LORD SAID THE MAN HIS SUNBURNED FACE REDDENING
SIL
IF THERE HAS BEEN SOME LITTLE MISTAKE WHAT C COULD I DO NOW TO FIX IT
<br> EVEN IF THERE HAS BEEN SOME LITTLE MISTAKE OOPS OKAY
FOR SEVERAL DAYS THIS STRATEGY ASSORTED THE STRANGELY ASSORTED PAIR ROAMED THE JUNGLE TOGETHER
THE EARL LOOKED AT IT AND THE CORNERS OF HIS MOUTH TWITCHED A LITTLE
<br> FOR YOU AND ME THERE IS NOTHING TO HOPE FOR NOTHING BEYOND WHAT WE HAVE
IF GOD SPARES BETH I NEVER WILL COMPLAIN AGAIN WHISPERED MEG EARNESTLY
THESE THOUGHTS HAUNT HIM HAUNTED HIM ALL DAY AND HE DREAMT THEM ALL LAST NIGHT
FOR NOTHING BRINGS JOY TO THE HEART LIKE THE COMING OF SPRING
SIL
SHE COULD SEE NOTHING EXCEPT THE MORNING GLORIES WHICH COVERED THE SIDE OF THE PORCH
WE NEVER KNEW THAT STRANGE PEOPLE EXISTED ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD
<br> SHE MUST BEGIN WITH THE CHINESE DYNASTY <unk> AND END WITH JAPAN
IN THE DEEP GLOOM SHE COULD NOT SEE THE SHE COULD SEE THE ANGER WHICH DARKENED HIS FACE
SHE WANTS TO GIVE THAT BOY AN EXTREMELY BAD OPINION OF ME
DIANA SEARCHED FAITHFULLY BUT NO AXE WAS TO BE FOUND IN THE WHOLE WOODSHED
I KNOW THE COUNTY STOCK LAW JUST AS WELL AS YOU DO
SIL
HOW STRANGE THAT A LIVE ANIMAL SHOULD BE SHOULD GROW ON A STALK LIKE A FLOWER
<br> I GUESS I'LL BUY A FEW SNAKES SINCE THEY LOOK SO FUNNY <unk> FUNNY COILING OUT
SIL
SEE THE WISDOM OF MY CHOICE HE SAID HOLDING UP THE LARGE LEAF OF GOLD
BUT I AM OLD TO ENDURE YOUR SHAME AND MY MISERIES MUCH LONGER
SIL
<br>
THE PANDA
IT WAS FRED'S IDEA SO LET'S BEGIN WITH FRED
FRED FED THE PANDA BEARS AND TIGERS AND TURTLES THE TURTLES WEREN'T SO BAD BUT AS FOR THE TIGERS HE WASN'T SO SURE
HE DIDN'T MIND HANDLING THE RAW MEAT HE HAD TO FEED THE TO THE TIGERS HIS MAIN OBJECT OBJECTION UH OBJECTION WAS BEING EATEN
NO ONE COULD BLAME FRED REALLY SINCE NO ONE REALLY WANTS TO BE EATEN
SOME PEOPLE LIKE TO BITE THEIR FINGER NAILS BUT FRED WASN'T A NAIL BITER SO BEING EATEN WAS DEFINITELY NOT SOMETHING THAT HE LOOKED FORWARD TO EACH AFTERNOON AT THREE O'CLOCK WHEN IT WAS TIME TO FEED THE TIGERS
<unk> FOR FRED WHEN IT CAME TO PANDAS HE HAD A WARM SPOT IN HIS HEART
ACTUALLY IT WAS AN EIGHTY FIVE POINT FIVE DEGREE SPOT ON HIS LEFT KIDNEY BUT THE POINT IS THAT HE WAS VERY FOND OF FEEDING THE PANDAS
THERE WERE THREE PANDAS AND THEY WERE KNOWN AS THE PAN FAMILY
THEY WERE IN ORDER OF CUTENESS YIN YIN THE YOUNG DAUGHTER POO POO THE MOTHER AND MOO MAN THE THE GENTLE AND ALWAYS SLEEPY FATHER
MANY KNOW MANY PEOPLE KNOW THAT PANDAS EAT BAMBOO A LOT OF IT
A LOT OF BAMBOO CAN GET QUITE HEAVY SO BECAUSE OF THE PANDAS FRED BECAME VERY STRONG AND WAS IN TERRIFIC SHAPE
BUT PHYSICAL FITNESS WAS NOT THE ONLY REASON THAT FRED LOVED THE PANDAS
THE OTHER REASON WAS THAT ANYONE WHO GETS TO WITHIN THREE FEET OF A PANDA AUTOMATICALLY FALLS IN LOVE WITH THEM IT'S THE LAW OF NATURE
AT FURTHER DISTANCES PANDAS HAVE STRANGE ALMOST MAGICAL EFFECT ON HUMAN BEINGS WHICH MAKES THEM WANT TO HUG HUG AND SQUEEZE THINGS
FRED <unk> WAS NOT ALLOWED TO ACTUALLY HUG THE PANDA BEARS SINCE THAT COULD BE DANGEROUS
SO ALL THE OTHER PEOPLE AT THE ZOO WOULD KNOW THAT THE PANDAS HAD JUST BEEN FED WHEN THEY SAW FRED HUGGING THE RATHER RATHER UN CUDDLY PALM TREE OUTSIDE THE PANDA'S HOME
<unk> IT IS INTERESTING TO POINT OUT THE TIME THAT THEY WERE S THAT MORE WERE STUFFED THAT MORE STUFFED PANDAS WERE SOLD AT THE ZOO GIFT SHOPS THEN ALL THE OTHER STUFF COMBINED
THIS ALMOST CERTAINLY BECAME ACCOUNTED FOR
SIL
BY THIS STRANGE MOST MAGICAL EFFECT ON THAT THE PANDAS POSSESSES
BUT EVERYTHING WAS NOT ALL BAMBOO AND HUGS AT THE ZOO
ONE MORNING FRED WAS FEEDING YIN YIN AND SAID OH YIN YIN I WISH MORE PEOPLE WOULD COME TO VISIT THE ZOO
I KNOW I SHOULDN'T BE TELLING YOU THIS BUT WE MIGHT HAVE TO SELL YOU AND YOUR FAMILY TO THE BIG ZOO IN LOS ANGELES IF WE DON'T GET MORE MONEY
IT'S NOT THAT YOU AREN'T SELLING ENOUGH STUFFED PANDA BEARS IT'S JUST THAT WE HAVEN'T IT'S JUST THAT THERE HAVEN'T BEEN ENOUGH PEOPLE COMING TO SEE YOU IN THE FIRST PLACE
<unk> I THINK WHAT THE ZOO NEEDS IS A GREAT ADVERTISING CA CAMPAIGN
<br> FRED WAS STARTING TO FEEL THE UNCONTROLLABLE URGE TO HUG THE PANDA
SO BEFORE HE RAN OFF TO HUG THE PALM TREE HE QUICKLY SAID
IT COSTS SO MUCH TO FEED YOU PANDA BEARS I WOULD HATE IF YOU HAD TO LEAVE US AFTER ALL IT'S THE ONLY HOME YOU KNOW BESIDES IF YOU LEAVE I'LL GET TERRIBLY OUT OF SHAPE
NOW IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME I NEED TO SQUEEZE SOMETHING BEFORE I SCREAM
BUT YIN YIN WAS THE YOUNGEST PANDA WAS NOT LISTENING TO FRED SHE WAS TALKING TO HER BEST FRIEND MAGGIE THE MAGPIE ABOUT GOING TO THE MOON
YES THE BIG ONE IN THE SKY THAT IS MOST LIKELY NOT MADE OF CHEESE AND MOST CERTAINLY NOT MADE OF BAMBOO
YIN YIN AND HER BEST FRIEND MAGGIE THE MAGPIE WHO LOOKED A LOT LIKE A PANDA IF
SIL
LIKE A PANDA WOULD IF PANDAS WERE BIRDS WERE DISCUSSING ABOUT GOING TO THE MOON
HER MOTHER AND FATHER UHM <unk> KNEW WHAT THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT SINCE THEY HAD THOUGHT THEY HADN'T THOUGHT OR TALKED OF MUCH ELSE SINCE YIN YIN SAID I WANT TO GO THERE AND POINTED TO THE MOON
ENOUGH OF THIS NONSENSE SAID YIN YIN'S MOTHER POO POO WHAT SORT OF NONSENSE IS THIS FOR A YOUNG PANDA BEAR GOING TO THE MOON INDEED NONSENSE
YOUR JOB IS TO BE CUTE SO PEOPLE WILL TO RUN TO THE GIFT SHOP AND BUY PANDA BEAR DOLLS IT'S SIMPLY ECONOMICS
LIKE IT OR NOT WE ARE SPOKESPEOPLE FOR THE PANDA STUFFED ANIMAL INDUSTRY WHICH YOUNG LADY HELPS PAY FOR THE BAMBOO YOU EAT
SUCH NONSENSE GOING TO THE MOON SAID HER MOTHER POO POO

I DON'T THINK IT WOULD TAKE THAT LONG TO ROLL THERE SAID YIN YIN
YIN YIN'S FATHER MOO MAN DIDN'T THINK IT WAS VERY PROPER OR WISE FOR A YOUNG PANDA BEAR TO GO ROLLING OFF TO PLACES WHERE THERE WASN'T ANY BAMBOO

NONSENSE SAID THE MOTHER I'M SO MAD
SIL
I'M GOING TO LOOK AT THAT LADY OVER THERE AND MAKE HER WANT TO SQUEEZE HER SON CHEEKS SHE SAID SPITEFULLY

SIL
WAS ALWAYS ONE TO TAKE GOOD ADVICE FROM HER FATHER AND LESS THAN A WEEK LATER YIN YIN AND MAGGIE HAD TO BUILD A ROCKET SHIP OUT OF BAMBOO
BAMBOO IS VERY WORK WORKABLE SUBSTANCE AND PANDAS TEND TO HANDLE BAMBOO A LOT SO THIS ITSELF WAS NOT VERY ASTONISHING
AT LEAST TO THE YIN YINS PARENTS FRED SURE WAS IMPRESSED THOUGH
THE MAIN OBSTACLE IT TURNS OUT WAS GETTING THE ROCKET SHIP OFF THE GROUND
MAGGIE FIGURED THAT IF SHE AND THE AND THREE OF HER STRONGEST MAGPIE FRIENDS WERE ABLE TO EACH GRAB HOLD OF A CORNER OF THE ROCKET SHIP THEY COULD ALL FLY TO THE MOON SO THEY TRIED
ONE TWO THREE TO THE MOON S THEY SAID TOGETHER PULLING WITH ALL THEIR MIGHT
I SEE YOUR WINGS FLAPPING BUT WE DON'T SEEM TO BE GOING ANYWHERE SAID YIN YIN
HMM HEAVIER THAN I THOUGHT I THINK WE'LL NEED SOME MORE MAGPIES SAID MAGGIE
YES BUT HOW DO WE GET MORE YIN YIN SAID
I'M NOT SURE EXACTLY REPLIED MAGGIE
<br> THE FATHER WATCHING ALL THIS THROUGH ONE EYE FOR HE ALWAYS HAD AT LEAST ONE EYE ASLEEP AT ALL TIMES SAID
SIL
T'WOULD BE THE BEST TO ASK THE OLD OWL THEN CLOSED HIS EYE
OH WISE OWL I HAVE A QUESTION THAT I FEAR ONLY YOU CAN ANSWER HE SAID
HOW TO TURN YOUR HEAD ALL THE WAY AROUND WITHOUT GETTING A TERRIBLE PAIN IN YOUR NECK SAID THE OWL
NO HOW MANY PEOPLE HOW MANY MAGPIE'S WOULD IT WOULD BE NEEDED TO FLY A FOUR HUNDRED PANDA BEAR TO THE
SIL
AND A ONE HUNDRED POUND BA BAMBOO ROCKET SHIP TO THE MOON SAID MAGGIE
THE OWL INSTANTLY REPLIED TWO HUNDRED S THOUSAND SEVENTY SIX GIVE OR TAKE TWO
A WEEK LATER MAGGIE MANAGED TO ROUND UP TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND AND SEVENTY EIGHT MAGPIES
SIL
SHE COULD BE VERY SHE COULD BE A VERY PERSUASIVE LITTLE BIRD WHEN SHE WANTED TO BE
A WEEK LATER DESPITE MUCH FLAPPING THEY WERE STILL TRYING TO GET THE ROCKET INTO THE AIR
IT TURNS OUT THAT THE OWL DID NOT TAKE IN CONSIDERATION THAT ONCE YOU ARE OVER A THOUSAND MAGPIE TOGETHER THEY TEND TO FIGHT AND DON'T AGREE ON A SINGLE THING
NOW WHILE ALL THIS WAS GOING ON WHAT DO YOU SUPPOSE FRED WAS DOING
WHY HE WAS THE FEEDING THE PANDAS LIKE HE WAS SUPPOSED TO
SO ONE DAY AFTER FRED HAD FED THE PANDAS HE WAS HUGGING THE PALM TREE THE ZOO MANAGER CAME UP TO HIM
WHAT IS GOING ON WITH YOUR PANDAS FRED I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT
IT'S TAKEN ME A COUPLE OF WEEKS TO FIGURE IT OUT BUT I THINK YIN YIN WANTS TO GO TO THE MOON AND THE MAGPIES WANT TO TAKE HER THERE SAID FRED
OH WELL THAT MAKES SENSE THEN SAID THE MANAGER
DO YOU KNOW THAT SINCE THE LITTLE PANDA BUILT THE BAMBOO ROCKET SHIP THAT THESE AND THOSE MAGPIE'S STARTED FLUTTERING ABOUT THE ZOO P THAT THE ZOO PROFITS HAVE G GONE UP FOUR THOUSAND PERCENT
THIS IS JUST THE TYPE OF EXPOSURE WE NEEDED THESE THOSE PANDAS WILL BE WITH US FOR A LONG TIME
FRED THOUGHT ABOUT IT AND SAID YOU KNOW I THINK WE SHOULD RENAME YIN YIN COLUMBUS
THE ZOO KEEPER SAID GOOD HEAVENS MAN THAT IS A GREAT IDEA NOW WAIT A SECOND I DON'T UNDERSTAND
WELL SIR COLUMBUS SET OUT ON A SHIP HE WAS REALLY TO TRYING TRYING TO FIND A QUICKER WAY TO GET TO GET AROUND THE W EUROPE IN ORDER TO IMPROVE IMPROVE TRADE
HE WANTED TO BE A BUSINESS MAN BUT INSTEAD HE BECAME A GREAT EXPLORER
YES BUT DOES THAT HAVE WHAT DOES THAT HAVE TO DO WITH THE PANDAS MAN THE ZOO KE SAID THE ZOO MANAGER
WELL IT SEEMS TO ME SIR SAID YIN YIN <unk> THAT YIN YIN WANTED TO BE A GREAT EXPLORER AND INSTEAD BECAME A BUSINESS WOMAN
I SEE FRED
SIL
ONE MORE THING SIR THOSE MAGPIES FLYING ABOUT THE PANDAS DO YOU THINK THE ZOO COULD PURCHASE ME A LARGE SIZE UMBRELLA
THE ZOO MANAGER LAUGHED AND WALKED AWAY BUT DI BUT DID PURCHASE A FASHIONABLE YELLOW UMBRELLA FOR FRED THE NEXT DAY
BACK IN THE PANDA'S HOME THE MOTHER PANDA POO POO WAS VERY PROUD OF HER DAUGHTER
AFTER ALL IF IT WEREN'T FOR YIN YIN THEY HAD TO MOVE FROM THEIR WONDERFUL HOME
BUT LATER F WHEN FRED WALKED INTO THE PANDA'S HOME UNDER HIS NEW YELLOW UMBRELLA ALL THAT SHE COULD THINK O TO SAY WAS NONSENSE
AS FOR YIN YIN SHE WAS PROUD TO BE VERY RENAMED AFTER THE FAMOUS EXPLORER AND SHE AND MAGPIE NEVER STOPPED TRYING TO GET TO THE MOON
AND SHE DID IT BECAUSE SHE WANTED TO GO TO THE MOON AND SO SHE AND HER FRIEND MAGGIE THE MAGPIE UHM BUILT A ROCKETSHIP AND GOT A BUNCH OF MAGPIES TO HELP FLY IT
BUT UH IT DIDN'T WORK BUT IT BROUGHT A LOT OF PEOPLE UHM TO COME WATCH THEM DO IT CAUSE IT WAS REALLY INTERESTING AND SO THE ZOO GOT LOTS OF MONEY
AND THEY NAMED HER AND THEY RENAMED YIN YIN COLUMBUS BECAUSE COLUMBUS W WHEN HE TRIED TO SAIL AROUND EUROPE HE UHM <unk> HE WANTED
SIL
HE WAS EXPLORING TO FIND A WAY TO UHM AN EASIER WAY TO GO AROUND EUROPE SO THE TRADE WOULD BE EASIER
AND UHM <br> SO BUT HE WANTED TO BE A BUSINESS MAN BUT HE ENDED BEING AN EX EXPLORER
AND YIN YIN WANTED TO BE AN EXPLORER BUT SHE ENDED UP BEING A BUSINESSWOMEN BECAUSE
UHM SHE BROUGHT LOTS OF BUSINESS TO THE A ZOO
SIL
OK
SIL
UHM FRED IS
SIL
HE FEEDS THE PANDAS AND HE ALWAYS CAUSE WHEN HE'S NEAR THE PANDA'S IT ALWAYS MAKES HIM WANT TO HUG SOMETHING
SO AND HE'S NOT ALLOWED TO HUG THE PANDA'S SO EVERYDAY AFTER HE FEEDS THE PANDA'S HE GOES AND HUGS A TREE
SIL
AND
SIL
AND IN THE END UHM CAUSE OF ALL THE SEAGULLS HE GOT A YELLOW UMBRELLA TO USE WHILE HE WAS FEEDING THE PANDA'S I MEAN NOT THE SEAGULLS THE MAGPIES
<br>
<unk> YES SAID ANNE CANDID CANDIDLY <unk> I'VE HEARD THAT YOU AND HE WERE ENGAGED ONCE
HE HAD A GENTLE AND REFINED FEATURES HIS VOICE WAS SOFT AND PLEASANT IN TONE
SIL
ONE WOULD SUPPOSE THAT THEY KNEW NOTHING AT ALL ABOUT SCHOOL AFFAIRS BUT THEY DO
<unk> AT PRACTICALLY THE SAME INSTANT THE THIRD SHOT WHISTLED FROM THE EAST
A SHADOW THAT CHILLED HIS HEART SEEMED GRADUALLY TO FALL UPON HIM
<unk> IT NEVER OCCURRED TO HIM THAT SHE MIGHT BE CHANGED HERSELF MIGHT BE CHANGED HERSELF
GOOD FRIEND SAID THE OTHER GENTLY I HAVE BUSINESS ELSEWHERE
THEREUPON I TOLD THE KING WITHOUT ANY RESERVE ALL THAT HAD HAPPENED
HANS WENT UP AND DOWN THE STREETS OF AMSTERDAM THAT DAY LOOKING FOR WORK
IT WAS A DEEP DAZZLING LOVELY BLUE DEEPER THAN THE DEEPEST BLUE OF THE SKY
<unk> YES SAID BEN IMMENSELY RELIEVED TO FIND THAT NO OFFENSE HAD BEEN TAKEN
THE SHELVES WERE CROWDED WITH DUSTY UTENSILS OF ALL SORTS
SHE GATHERED UP THE MOSS A AND THE REMAINS OF THE BEES WAX
HE HAS BROKEN NO WORD OF THE LAW OF THE JUNGLE
<br> THAT A GOOD DOG THAT'S A GOOD DOG ANYONE CAN TELL THAT
THE KING <unk> THOUGHT HE FROWNED HARD AND RUBBED HIS EAR
<unk> WHAT ARE THOSE FOOLISH BUNDLES IN THE BACK OF THIS SILLY CART
BUT I'M AWFULLY HUNGRY I WISH YOU'D GET ME SOMETHING TO EAT
WORST DOSE I EVER ENDURED AND I'D NOTHING TO DO BUT WITH SWELTER IN THE HEAT
<unk> MEN REJOICED OPENLY HOPPING HOPING THAT IT WOULD SPREAD AND SEND THEM INTO CAMP
MARCO ONLY STOOD QUITE STILL AND LOOKED AT HIM WITH UNDERSTANDING AND GRAVITY
<unk> GREAT WAS THE INDIGNATION OF THE NOBLE BIRD AS HE WATCHED THE SCENE BELOW
SIL
I THINK I SEE PEARLS AND DIAMONDS COME OUT OF THE GIRL'S MOUTH
WHAT IF HE HAD BRAINS AND MILITARY SKILLS AND ALL THAT SORT OF THING
SIL
THE PANDA
WHY DID THE A PANDA WITH TH THE BEAUTIFUL GIRL YIN YIN HAVE HER NAME CHANGED TO THE VERY UN BEAUTIFUL GIRL NAME COLUMBUS
<unk> IT WAS FRED'S IDEA SO LET''S BEGIN WITH FRED
FRED FED THE PANDA BEARS THE TIGERS THE TURTLES AND THE TURTLES
THE TURTLES WEREN'T SO BAD BUT AS FOR THE TIGERS HE WASN'T SO SURE
HE DIDN'T MIND HANDLING THE RAW MEAT HE HAD TO FEED THE TO THE TIGERS HIS MAIN OBJECTION WAS BEING EATEN
NO ONE COULD BLAME FRED REALLY SINCE NO ONE REALLY WANTS TO BE EATEN
<br> SOME PEOPLE <unk> DO NOT LIKE TO BITE THEIR FINGER NAILS BUT FRED WASN'T A NAIL BITER
SO BEING EATEN WAS DEFINITELY NOT SOMETHING HE LOOKED FORWARD TO EACH AFTERNOON AT THREE O'CLOCK WHEN IT WAS TIME TO FEED THE TIGERS
FOR FRED
SIL
WHEN IT CAME TO THE PANDAS HE HAD A WARM SPOT IN HIS HEART
ACTUALLY IT WAS EIGHTY FIVE POINT FIVE DEGREE SPOT WHERE O SPOT ON HIS KIDNEY BUT <unk> THE POINT IS THAT HE WAS VERY FOND OF FEEDING THE PON PANDAS
THERE WERE THREE PANDAS AND THEY WERE KNOWN AS PAN THE PAN FAMILY
THEY WERE IN ORDER OF CUTENESS YIN YIN THE YOUNG DAUGHTER POO POO THE MOTHER AND MOO MOO MAN MOO MAN THE GENTLE ALWAYS SLEEPY FATHER
SIL
MANY PEOPLE KNOW THE PANDAS
SIL
EAT BAMBOO <unk> PANDAS EAT BAMBOO
A LOT OF IT A LOT OF BAMBOO CAN GET QUITE HEAVY SO <unk> BECAUSE OF THE PANDAS FRED BECAME <unk> A VERY BECAME VERY STRONG AND WAS IN TERRIFIC SHAPE
BUT PHYSICAL FITNESS WAS NOT THE ONLY REASON FRED LOVED THE PANDAS
THE OTHER REASON WAS THAT ANYONE WHO GETS WITHIN THREE FEET OF THE PANDA AUTOMATICALLY FALLS IN LOVE WITH THEM
IT'S THE LAW OF NATURE
SIL
AT FURTHER DISTANCES PANDAS HAVE A STRANGE ALMOST MAGICAL EFFECT
SIL
ON HUMAN BEINGS WHICH MAKES US WANT TO HUG AND SQUEEZE THINGS
FRED WAS NOT ALLOWED TO ACTUALLY HUG THE PANDAS
SIL
BEARS SINCE
SIL
THAT COULD BE DANGEROUS
SO ALL THE OTHER PEOPLE AT THE ZOO WOULD KNOW THAT THE PANDAS HAD JUST BEEN FED WHEN THEY SAW FRED HUGGING A RATHER UN CUDDLY PALM TREE OUTSIDE THE PANDA'S HOME
SIL
SIL
THIS CAN ALMOST CERTAINLY BE ACCOUNTED FOR BY THIS STRANGE ALMOST MAGICAL EFFECT THAT THE PANDA POSSESS
SIL
<unk> BUT EVERYTHING WAS NOT ALL BAMBOO AND HUGS AT THE ZOO
ONE MORNING FRED WAS FEEDING YIN YIN AND SAID Y OH YIN YIN I WISH I W THAT MORE PEOPLE WOULD COME VISIT THE ZOO
I KNOW I SHOULDN'T BE TELLING YOU THIS WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO SELL BUT WE MIGHT HAVE TO SELL YOU
SIL
AND YOUR FAMILY TO THE BIG ZOO IN SAN ANGELES AN THAT'S SAN ANGELES OKAY UHM IF WE DON'T <unk> GET ENOUGH MONEY
SIL
IT'S NOT THAT YOU AREN'T S COMING
SIL
SELLING ENOUGH STUFFED PANDA BEARS IT'S JUST THAT WE THAT THERE HAVEN'T BEEN ENOUGH PEOPLE COMING TO THE ZOO
I THINK THE ZOO NEED IS A GREAT ADVERTISING CAMPAIGN CAMPAIGN <unk>
SO BEFORE HE RAN OFF TO HUG A PALM TREE HE QUICKLY SAID IT COSTS MORE SO MUCH TO FEED YOU PANDA BEARS I WOULD HATE IF YOU HAD TO LEAVE US
AFTER ALL IT'S THE ONLY HOME YOU KNOW BESIDES IF YOU LEAVE I'LL GET TERRIBLY OUT OF SHAPE
NOW IF YOU YOU'LL EXCUSE ME I NEED TO SQUEEZE SOMETHING BEFORE I SCREAM
BUT YIN YIN THE YOUNG PANDA WAS NOT LISTENING TO FRED SHE WAS TALKING TO HER BEST FRIEND MAGGIE THE MAGPIE <unk> ABOUT GOING TO THE MOON
YES THE BIG ONE IN THE SKY THAT IS MOST LIKELY TO NOT BE MADE OF CHEESE AND MOST CERTAINLY NOT MADE OUT OF BAMBOO
YIN YIN'S <unk> AND HER BEST FRIEND MAGGIE THE MAGPIE WHO LOOKED <unk> A LOT LIKE A PANDA WOULD <unk> LOOK IF
SIL
HER MOTHER AND FATHER KNEW WHAT <unk>
SIL
KNEW WHAT KNEW WHAT
SIL
THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT SINCE THEY HADN'T TAUGHT THOUGHT OR TALKED MUCH ELSE SINCE YIN YIN SAID I WANT TO GO THERE <unk> AND POINTED TO THE MOON
<unk> ENOUGH OF THIS NONSENSE SAID YIN YIN'S MOTHER POO POO
SIL
WHAT SORT OF NONSENSE IS THIS FOR A YOUNG PANDA BEAR GOING TO THE MOON INDEED NONSENSE
<br> YOUR JOB IS TO BE CUTE SO PEOPLE WANT TO RUN TO THE GIFT SHOP AND BUY PANDA BEAR DOLLS
IT'S SIMPLE ECONOMICS LIKE IT OR NOT WE ARE SPOKESPEOPLE FOR PANDAS FOR PANDA STUFFED ANIMALS INDUSTRY WHICH YOUNG LADY HELPS PAY FOR THE BAMBOO YOU EAT
SUCH NONSENSE GOING TO THE MOON S SAID HER MOTHER POO POO
SIL
<unk>
SIL
<unk> BUT I JUST LEARNED HOW TO MAKE MYSELF INTO A BALL AND ROLL TWO DAYS AGO
SIL
I'VE BECOMING VERY GOOD AT IT I DON'T THINK IT WILL TAKE THAT LONG TO ROLL THERE SAID YIN YIN
SIL
<unk>
SIL
<unk> YIN YIN'S FATHER MOO MAN DIDN'T THINK IT WAS VERY PROPER OR WISE FOR A YOUNG PANDA BEAR TO GO ROLLING OFF TO PLACES WHERE SHE THERE WASN'T ANY BAMBOO
BUT HE WAS SUPPORTIVE OF HIS DAUGHTER AND SHOWED HIS SUPPORT BY TAKING A NAP
SIL
T'WOULDN'T BE BEST TO FLY
NONSENSE SAID THE MOTHER <unk> I'M SO MAD I'M GONNA GOING TO <unk>
SIL
LOOK AT THAT YOUNG THAT LADY OVER THE THERE AND MAKE HER WANT TO SQUEEZE HER SONS CHEEKS
SIL
<unk> SHE SAID SPITEFULLY
AN INSTANT LATER
SIL
A YOUNG BOY WAS HEARD SAYING OW MOM CUT THAT OUT
I'M SORRY TO SAY BUT MANY LITTLE BOY'S CHEEKS HAVE BEEN MADE RAW WHEN MOTHER POO POO PANDA WAS UPSET
<br> YIN YIN WAS ALWAYS THE ONE TO TAKE GOOD ADVICE FROM HER FATHER
SIL
AND LESS THAN A WEEK LATER YIN YIN AND MAGGIE HAD BUILT A ROCKET SHIP OUT OF BAMBOO
BAMBOO IS VERY UH VERY WORKABLE SUBSTANCE
SIL
<unk> AND PANDAS TEND TO HANDLE BAMBOO A LOT SO <unk> THIS IN ITSELF WAS NOT SO ASTONISHING
AT LEAST TO THE YIN YIN'S PARENTS FRED SURE WAS IMPRESSED THOUGH
SIL
THE MAIN OBSTACLE IT TURNS OUT WAS GETTING THE ROCKET SHIP OFF THE GROUND
MAGGIE FIGURED IF SHE AND THREE OF THE HER STRONGEST MAGPIE FRIEND WERE TO EACH GRAB HOLD OF ONE CORNER OF THE ROCKET SHIP <unk> THEY COULD FLY TO THE MOON SO THEY TRIED
ONE TWO THREE TO THE MOON THEY SAID TOGETHER PULLING WITH ALL THEIR MIGHT
I SEE YOUR WINGS FLAPPING BUT I DON'T SEE THEM GOING ANYWHERE SAID YIN YIN
HMM HEAVIER THAN I THOUGHT I THINK WE'LL NEED MORE MAGPIES
YES BUT HOW MANY MORE I'M NOT SURE EXACTLY REPLIED MAGGIE
THE FATHER WATCHING THIS ALL THROUGH ONE EYE FOR HE ALWAYS HAD AT LEAST ONE EYE ASLEEP AT ALL TIMES <unk> SAID
<unk> T'WOULDN'T IT BE BEST TO ASK OWL THEN HE CLOSED AN EYE
SO MAGGIE FLEW TO OWL AND ASKED FOR ADVICE
OH WISE OWL I HAVE A QUESTION THAT I FEAR Y ONLY YOU CAN ANSWER
HOW TO TURN YOUR HEAD ALL THE WAY AROUND
SIL
WITHOUT GETTING A TERRIBLE PAIN IN YOUR NECK O SAID OWL
<br> NO HOW MANY MAGPIES WOULD IT
SIL
WOULD BE NEEDED TO FLY A FOUR HUNDRED POUND PANDA BEAR AND A ONE HUNDRED POUND BAMBOO ROCKET SHIP TO THE MOON
THE OWL INSTANTLY REPLIED TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND SEVENTY SIX GIVE OR TAKE TWO
SIL
<unk> A WEEK LATER M MAGGIE MANAGED TO ROUND UP TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND AND SEVENTY EIGHT MAGPIES
SHE COULD BE BE VERY PERSUASIVE A VERY PERSUASIVE LITTLE BIRD WHEN SHE WANTED
<br>
A WEEK LATER DESPITE MUCH FLAPPING THEY WERE STILL TRYING TO GET THE ROCKET INTO THE AIR
IT TURNS OUT THAT THE OWL DIDN'T TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION THAT ONCE YOU GET OVER ONE THOUSAND MAGPIES TOGETHER THEY TEND TO FIGHT AND CAN'T AGREE ON A SINGLE THING
SIL
<unk> NOW WHILE ALL THIS WAS GOING ON <unk> WHAT DO YOU SUPPOSE FRED WAS DOING
SIL
WHY HE WAS FEEDING THE PANDAS LIKE HE WAS SUPPOSED TO
ONE DAY AFTER FRED HAD FED THE PANDAS A
SIL
IS GOING ON
SIL
AFTER FRED FED THE PANDAS <unk> H AND HE WAS HUGGING A PALM TREE THE ZOO MANAGER CAME UP TO HIM AND SAID WHAT'S GOING ON WITH YOUR PANDA FRED
I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT
IT'S TAKEN ME A COUPLE OF WEEKS TO FIGURE IT OUT BUT I THINK
SIL
YIN YIN WANTS TO GO TO THE MOON AND THE MAGPIE WANTS TO TAKE HER THERE
SIL
OH WELL THAT MAKES SENSE THEN
DID YOU KNOW THAT SINCE THE LITTLE PANDA C BUILT THE BAMBOO ROCKET SHIP AND THOSE MAGPIES STARTED FLUTTERING ABOUT THAT THE ZOO'S PROFITS HAVE GONE UP FOUR THOUSAND PERCENT
THIS IS JUST THE TYPE OF EXPOSURE WE NEEDED <unk> THOSE PANDAS WILL BE WITH US FOR A LONG TIME <unk>
FRED THOUGHT ABOUT IT <unk> AND SAID YOU KNOW I THINK WE SHOULD RENAME YIN YIN COLUMBUS
THE ZOO KEEPER SAID GOOD HEAVENS MAN THAT IS A GREAT IDEA
NO WAIT A SECOND I DON'T UNDERSTAND
<br> WELL SIR WHEN COLUMBUS GOT OUT SET OUT ON HIS SHIP HE WAS REALLY TRYING TO FIND A
SIL
QUICKER WAY TO GET AROUND EUROPE IN ORDER TO IMPROVE TRADE HE WANTED TO BE A BUSINESS MAN BUT INSTEAD HE BECAME A GREAT EXPLORER
SIL
<unk> YES BUT WHY DOES <unk> THAT HAVE TO DO WITH YIN WITH THE PANDA'S NAME A SAID THE ZOO MANAGER
WELL IT SEEMS TO ME SIR YIN YIN WANTED TO BE A GREAT EX EXPLORER BUT INSTEAD BECAME A BUSINESS WOMAN
I SEE FRED
ONE MORNING ONE MORE THING SIR ABOUT THOSE MAGPIES FLYING ABOVE THE PANDAS DO YOU THINK THAT THE ZOO COULD PURCHASE A LARGE SI ME A LARGE SIZED UMBRELLA
THE ZOO MANAGER LAUGHED AND WALKED AWAY BUT HE BUT DID PURCHASE A FASHIONABLE YELLOW UMBRELLA FOR FRED THE NEXT DAY
<unk> BACK IN THE PANDA'S F <unk> HOME THE MOTHER PANDA <unk> POO POO WAS VERY PROUD OF HER DAUGHTER
AFTER ALL IF IT WEREN'T FOR YIN YIN
SIL
THEY WOULD HAVE TO MOVE FROM THEIR WONDERFUL HOME
BUT LATER WHEN FRED WALKED INTO THE PANDA'S HOME UNDER HIS NEW YELLOW UMBRELLA UMBRELLA SHE COULD THINK ONLY TO SAY NONSENSE
AS FOR YIN YIN SHE WAS VERY PROUD TO BE RENAMED AFTER A FAMOUS EXPLORER AND SHE SHE AND THE MAGPIE MAGGIE NEVER STOPPED TRYING TO GET TO THE MOON
WHAT DO YOU MEAN LIKE UHM
SIL
HOW IT WAS OR WHAT IT WAS ABOUT
OR WHAT I THINK IT WAS A GOOD STORY BUT UHM I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND HOW THE PEOPLE COULD TALK TO THE ANIMALS AND THE ANIMALS COULD TALK TO DIFFERENT TYPES OF ANIMALS THAT I JUST DIDN'T UNDERSTAND BUT UHM
SIL
<br> I LIKED HOW HE THOUGHT UP THIS CLEVER NAME COLUMBUS AT THE END
SIL
BECAUSE IT WAS JUST THE OPPOSITE BUT UHM <br>
SIL
AND I LIKED HOW THE PANDA WANTED TO GO TO THE MOON BECAUSE I KNOW THAT'S A DREAM OF MANY KIDS AND I REALLY LIKED THE NARRATIVES LIKE UHM
SIL
ACTUALLY IT WAS A EIGHTY FIVE POINT FIVE DEGREES SPOT ON HIS LEFT KIDNEY BUT THE POINT IS THAT HE WAS VERY FOND OF FEEDING THE PANDA'S OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT AND <br> <unk> IT WAS A GOOD STORY
THIS WAS THE STORY ABOUT A PANDA WHO WANTED TO GO TO THE MOON <unk> BUT SHE COULDN'T UNTIL SHE HAD SOME NECESSARY THINGS
MEANWHILE THE HUMANS WERE THINKING OF SENDING THE PANDA'S TO A DIFFERENT ZOO BECAUSE THEY WEREN'T GETTING ENOUGH MONEY INTO <br> BUT ONCE SHE BUILT A ROCKETSHIP AND GOT
UHM TWO THOUSAND EIGHTY EIGHT MAGPIES TO TRY AND CARRY THE RO OH ROCKETSHIP MADE OUT OF BAMBOO THEIR PROFITS TRIPLED BY
I MEAN QUADRUPLED <unk> WELL THEY GOT HIGHER <br> AND YEAH <unk> OK THAT'S ALL I CAN THINK OF

FOR YOU NEVER KNEW EXACTLY WHAT IS MAN MIGHTY S MAN MIGHT SAY OR DO

SIL
HE TILTED HIS HAT BRIM TO SHADE HIS FACE AND LOOKED FOR HIS CHICKENS
THE POOR PERSECUTED COUNTRY PEOPLE BELIEVED THAT THE NEW FOREST WAS ENCHANTED
TOM'S COSTUME WAS A SPLENDID IMITATION OF A COWBOY
YOUR LORDSHIP IS GREATLY TO BE
SIL
IF I WERE AS BIG AS YOU ARE JIM I'D FIGHT THESE MISERABLE TURNIP ROOTS
IT WAS THAT DAY WHEN YOU GOT YOUR TOES YOUR TOE POUNDED ADDED DAVIE LOOK LOOKING AT JOEL L JOEL
NAN RECEIVED A SEWING MACHINE TO REMIND HER OF THE FRESH AIR WORK
WE ALL LOOKED AT EACH OTHER TRYING TO GLEAN SOMETHING FROM EACH OTHER
SIL
DIANA SHOOK HER HEAD GLEEFULLY HER BLACK EYES DANCED WITH MERRIMENT
SIL
THEN HE PULLED THE HOOD OF HIS CLOAK OVER HIS EARS AND OVER HIS BROW
WHICH OF YOU BOYS PLACED THIS THIS STONE SIG SIGNAL ASKED THE YOUNG EXPLORER
SIL
THE SLOWEST TURTLE
EVERY FOUR YEARS TURTLES
SIL
FROM ALL OVER THE LAND WOULD CRAWL TO GREAT POND
<br> IT WOULD TAKE SOME TURTLES FROM FAR AWAY VILLAGES TWO WHOLE WEEKS JUST TO GET THERE
<br>
WHEN ALL THE
SIL
TURTLES ARRIVED THERE WAS A SEVEN DAY FESTIVAL CALLED THE SHELL DWELLERS FESTIVAL WHERE THERE WAS LOTS OF EATING AND LAUGHING
TURTLES COULD CATCH UP WITH FRIENDS THEY HAD NOT SEEN SINCE LAST FESTIVAL
EVERYTHING ABOUT THE FESTIVAL WAS FUN BUT THE MAIN EVENT WAS THE GREAT TURTLE RACE
<br> THE WINNER OF THE GREAT <unk> TURTLE RACE WAS SO IMPORTANT THAT HE OR SHE DIDN'T HAVE TO MOVE FOR FOUR YEARS UNTIL THE NEXT FESTIVAL
THE LESS A TURTLE MOVES THE BIGGER THEY GET AND THE LONGER THEY LIVE SO <unk> YOU CAN SEE WINNING THE GREAT THE GREAT RACE IS A GREAT HONOR
<br> THE TURTLE CUP WAS THE TROPHY THAT THE WINNER WOULD TAKE HOME TO THE VILLAGE
<br> IT WO IT HAD BEEN IN
SIL
SLUDGE POND FOR OVER FIFTY YEARS BECAUSE NO ONE COULD EVER BEAT THEIR TURTLE
<br> THIS WAS THE MOST FAMOUS TURTLE THERE WAS HE WAS THE SLOWEST TURTLE OF ALL TIME
SIL
HE HADN'T
SIL
HE HADN'T HAD TO MOVE FOR OVER FIFTY YEARS
HE WAS THE BIGGEST MOST RESPECTED AND ALSO ONE OF THE TRICKIEST TURTLES THERE WAS
THERE WERE MANY LEGENDS ABOUT HIM IT WAS THE IT WAS RUMORED HE WAS SO SLOW HIS HEART WOULD ONLY BEAT ONCE A DAY
HIS NAME WAS MUD AND HE WAS THE GREATEST CHAMPION IN THE HISTORY OF SHELL DWELLER'S FESTIVAL HE WAS UNBEATABLE
WHEN MUD WAS IN HIS PRIME THERE WAS A NEW TURTLE BORN IN BLUE POND
THIS TURTLE WAS NAMED SWISH <unk> WHEN SWISH WAS BORN EVERYONE THOUGHT HE WAS A LITTLE SLOW
<br> BUT HE GOT A LI A LITTLE OLDER AND TUR THE TURTLES BEGAN TO REALIZE THAT SWISH WAS REALLY REALLY REALLY SLOW
<unk> ONCE HIS MOTHER CALLED HIM IN FOR DINNER AND HE DIDN'T MAKE IT HOME UNTIL BREAKFAST THE NEXT MORNING AND HE WAS ONLY A FOOT AWAY
SIL
BLUE POND WAS A NICE VILLAGE LOCATED ABOUT THREE DAYS CRAWL FROM GREAT POND
THEY ALL FELT A LITTLE SAD BECAUSE THEY HADN'T HELD THE TURTLE CUP IN OVER SEVEN HUNDRED YEARS
<br> SO WITH SWISH THEY THOUGHT MAYBE JUST MAYBE HE COULD BRING BACK THE TURTLE CUP TO THEIR LITTLE POND
<unk> EVERYONE TREATED SWISH DIFFERENTLY
FOR EXAMPLE MISTER PEEKS THE LOCAL SHELL CLEANER WOULD SAY HEY THERE SWISH YOU WANT A FREE SHELL WAXING TODAY
WE ALL WANT YOU TO LOOK GOOD WHEN YOU BRING HOME THE CUP
MS SNAPPER WOULD SAY HI SWISHY DO YOU WANT SOME YUMMY PIE TO FILL YOU UP AND SLOW YOU DOWN FOR THE BIG RACE
<br> A FAT TURTLE IN THE SLOW TURTLE A FAT TURTLE IS A SLOW TURTLE
MS SNAPPER WAS NEVER NICE TO ANYONE BUT SHE WAS NICE TO S SWISH
<br> MISTER PEEKS WOULD NEVER DO ANYTHING FOR FREE BUT HE WAS GOING TO GIVE SWISH A FREE SHELL WAXING
THIS WAS THE KIND OF THING THAT SWISH WOULD GET ALL THE TIME
<br> ALL THE EXTRA ATTENTION MADE SWISH VERY UNCOMFORTABLE HE THOUGHT
SURE THEY'RE NICE TO ME NOW <unk> BECAUSE THEY THINK I CAN WIN THE RACE BUT IF I LOSE THEY'LL BE DISAPPOINTED AND MAD AT ME
<unk> I NEVER PROMISED THAT I WOULD WIN THE RACE I CAN'T BEAT MUD ANYWAY I HEARD ONCE IT TOOK HIM THREE DAYS JUST TO YAWN
SO ONE DAY HE TOLD HIS PARENTS I DON'T WANT TO RACE
ALL THE TURTLES IN BLUE POND HELD A MEETING TO DISCUSS THE PROBLEM
<br> THE MAYOR DOCTOR SOFTSHELL SAID THIS IS RIDICULOUS SWISH HAS TO RACE HE'S THE SLOWEST TURTLE I'VE EVERY S <unk> EVERY SEEN
SIL
EXCEPT FOR MUD OF COURSE WITHOUT HIM WE DON'T HAVE A CHANCE
BUT HE DOESN'T WANT TO BE TREATED SPECIAL HE JUST WANTS TO BE NORMAL AND DOESN'T WANT EVERYBODY TO HATE HIM IF HE CAN'T BEAT MUD
YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT EVEN THOUGH HE'S GIFTED AT BEING SLOW HE'S VERY VERY YOUNG SAID SWISH'S FATHER
WE NEVER THOUGHT OF THAT THEY ALL SAID
THE TOWN AGREED TO TREAT SWISH LIKE A NORMAL PERSON AND AFTER A WHILE SWISH DECIDED THAT HE WOULD BE PROUD TO TO RACE FOR HIS VILLAGE
WHEN THE TIME OF THE FESTIVAL DREW NEAR ALL THE TURTLES IN THE LAND STARTED TOWARD GREAT POND
<br> SWISH HAD TO BE CARRIED ON HIS FATHER'S BACK SINCE IT WOULD HAVE TAKEN HIM MONTHS TO GET TO THE GREAT POND BY HIMSELF
FINALLY AFTER THE LONG JOURNEY ALL THE TURTLES ARRIVED AT GREAT F POND
THIS WAS SWISH'S FIRST EVER SHELL DWELLERS FESTIVAL AND HE THOUGHT IT WAS THE MOST WONDERFUL THING HE HAD EVER SEEN
<unk> THERE WERE THOUSANDS OF TURTLES ALL OF DIFFERENT SPECIES ALL HAVING A GREAT TIME
LOOK THERE'S YOUR COUSIN PEEK A BOO FROM BIG PUDDLE VILLAGE <unk> SAID SWISH'S MOTHER YOU'LL GET UHM GET TO MEET ALL SORTS OF NEW TURTLES
SWISH WAS SUDDENLY VERY EXCITED HE TOLD HIS MOM YOU KNOW WHAT I'M GOING TO WIN THIS RACE
SIL
I KNOW IT AND ALL THESE TURTLES WILL KNOW THAT BLUE POND RULES I'M NOT AFRAID OF STUPID MUD
SWISH'S MOM SMILED AND SAID I KNOW THAT YOU CAN WIN SWISH BUT IT'S AN HONOR JUST TO GET TO THE RACE SAID SWISH'S MOM
SIL
SWISH SAW A ROCK IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FIELD AND WONDERED HOW COME THEY DIDN'T MOVE THAT BIG ROCK OUT OF THE FIELD IT SEEMS TO BE IN EVERYONE'S WAY
SIL
SAID SWISH
THAT'S NOT A ROCK SWEETIE <unk> SAID HIS MOM THAT'S MUD
SWISH MADE A LOUD GULPING SOUND JUST DO YOUR BEST SAID HIS MOM
<unk> SWISHES FATHER SAID SON I HAVE SOMETHING TO TELL YOU AS YOU KNOW YOUR GREAT GREAT GRAND TURTLE RACED MUD ONCE
HE WASN'T AS SLOW AS YOU BUT HE DID TEACH ABOUT MUD'S
SIL
DIRTY TRICKS THEN HE WHISPERED IN SWISH'S EAR ALL THE TRICKS THAT HIS GREAT GREAT GRAND TURTLE TAUGHT HIM
AFTER SEVEN DAYS OF PLAYING AND DANCING <unk> AND BUG EATING FINALLY THE DAY OF THE RACE CAME
THE MAYOR OF GREAT POND
SIL
MS TORT P
SIL
POSTED THE T RULES OF THE RACE ON THE TREE FOR EVERYONE TO SEE
THEY READ RULE NUMBER ONE THE GREAT RACE BEGINS AT SUNRISE AND ENDS AT SUNSET
RULE NUMBER TWO TURTLES ALL TURTLES MUST RUN AS FAST AS THEY CAN AND THE TURTLE THAT IS CLOSEST TO THE STARTING LINE WINS
RULE NUMBER THREE NO TURTLE MAY PRETEND TO BE GOING FAST BUT GOING GO SLOW INSTEAD ALL TURTLE MUST GO AS FAST AS THEY CAN AT ALL TIMES
SINCE TURTLE NEVER CHEAT THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT RULE TO BREAK THIS RULE WOULD MEAN AN END TO THE GREAT TURTLE RACE FOREVER
RULE NUMBER FOUR NO TURTLE MAY FALL ASLEEP SINCE IF YOU ARE ASLEEP YOU AREN'T RUNNING AS FAST AS YOU CAN
SIL
SWISH READ THE RULES EVEN THOUGH HE KNEW THEM BY HEART
THEN HE HEARD THE MAYOR SAID RUNNER'S PLEASE TAKE YOUR POSITIONS
THE SLOWEST TURTLES FROM EACH POND WERE CARRIED TO THE STARTING LINE BY MEMBERS OF THEIR VILLAGE
THERE WERE ABOUT THREE HUNDRED TURTLES RACING THERE WERE ALL THE SLOWEST OF THE SLOW THE TURTLES ALL STRETCHED
SIL
AND THOUGHT REALLY SLOW THOUGHTS AS THEY DID THE SKY TURNED BA TURNED FROM BLACK TO DARK BLUE
THEY LOOKED AT THE HORIZON AND SAW THE SUN WAS STARTING THE RISE JUST THEN THE MAYOR SAID READY SET SLOW AND OFF THEY WENT
<br> ALL THE TURTLES WERE VERY VERY SLOW SO IT TOOK T TOOK SOME TIME BEFORE ANYONE FIGURED OUT WHICH TURTLES WAS THE SLOWEST
AFTER A FEW HOURS MOST OF THE TURTLES HAD GONE A FEW FEET ALL EXCEPT TWO
SWISH AND MUD WERE BOTH BACK AT THE STARTING LINE IT LOOKED AS IF NEITHER OF THEM HAD MOVED AT ALL
<br> THEY WERE BOTH MOVING OF COURSE BUT THEY WERE SO SLOW THAT IT WAS HARD TO TELL
AFTER SIX HOURS MUD AND S SWISH WERE STILL TIED AND HAD ONLY MOVED A FEW INCHES
BY NOW ALL THE TURTLES WERE JUST WERE USUALLY WAY AHEAD OF MUD BUT THIS TIME SWISH HAD WAS JUST AS SLOW
<br> MUD KNEW THAT THIS WOULD BE HIS CLOSEST RACE EVER AND HE WAS ACTUALLY GETTING A LITTLE BIT SCARED
WHO IS THIS YOUNG PUNK HE THOUGHT TO HIMSELF
SIL
MUD SAID TO SWISH THERE'S NO WAY THAT A TURTLE AS YOUNG AS YOU CAN BE SO SLOW EVEN I WAS FASTER THAN YOUR THAN YOU WHEN YOU I WAS YOUR AGE
YOU'RE CHEATING YOU'RE GOING TO RUIN THE GREAT RACE FOREVER
BUT SWISH WOULDN'T LET MUD SCARE HIM YOU'RE JUST TRYING TO MAKE ME QUIT I'M NOT GOING TO FALL TO YOUR TRICKS
SIL
HE SAID TURTLES NEVER CHEAT AND I'M A TURTLE WITH HONOR
THEN MUD TRIED ANOTHER TRICK HE STARTED SINGING A SOFT BEAUTIFUL LULLABY
SWISH STARTED YAWNING HE WAS TIRED FROM RACING AND THOUGHT THAT IF
SIL
IT WOULD BE THAT IT WOULD BE NICE TO JUST LISTEN TO MUD'S SWEET VOICE AND FALL ASLEEP
THEN HE SNAPPED OUT OF IT AND REMEMBERED HIS FATHER HAD WARNED HIM OF HIS OF THIS TRICK
HE REACHED IN HIS SHELL AND AND PULLED OUT A COUPLE OF EARPLUGS
THEN PUT THE EARPLUGS IN HIS EARS AND COULDN'T HEAR MUD'S SINGING ANYMORE
MUD KEPT SINGING HIS LULLABY FOR A FEW HOURS BUT HE STOPPED RIGHT BEFORE SUNSET <unk>
THE CROWD THOUGHT HE MUST HAVE REALIZED THAT HIS SINGING TRICK WASN'T WORKING BUT THEN
SIL
BUT THEN RIGHT AT THE END RIGHT BEFORE THE SUNSET SWISH STARTED TO PULL AHEAD OF MUD
OH NO SHOUTED THE FANS MUD'S WINNING
IT LOOKED LIKE MUD IS STILL THE GREATEST TURTLE OF THEM ALL AND WHEN THE SUN WENT DOWN MUD WAS THE CLOSEST TURTLE TO THE STARTING LINE
SWISH WAS SAD THAT HE LOST BUT ALL THE TURTLES FROM BLUE POND W CHEERED FOR SWISH
THEY WERE VERY PROUD
SIL
HE GAVE MUD SUCH A CLOSE RACE
SWISH WAS HAPPY TOO BUT DEEP DOWN I INSIDE HE KNEW HE WAS JUST AS SLOW AS MUD
THE MAYOR OF PONDLAND WENT TO PRESENT THE TURTLE CUP TO SLUDGE POND AGAIN
SHE ANNOUNCED WELL MUD IT LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE YOU'VE DONE IT SLUDGE POND WINS THE TURTLE CUP AGAIN
THIS TIME IT WAS A BIT CLOSER THAN YOU WOULD HAVE LIKED IT
SIL
I'LL BET
WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO SAY TO ALL THE TURTLES AT THE FESTIVAL
THE CROWD STARTED YELLING SPEECH SPEECH
MUD DIDN'T ANSWER THE MAYOR TAPPED MUD ON THE SHELL AND SAID HELLO HELLO MUD
MUD STILL DIDN'T ANSWER IN FACT MUD WAS SOUND ASLEEP MUD HAD ACTUALLY SUNG HIMSELF TO SLEEP
SIL
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN SHE SAID MUD FROM SLUDGE POND HAS BEEN DISQUALIFIED FOR SLEEPING DURING THE RACE
THIS MEANS THAT WE HAVE A NEW CHAMPION THE REAL WINNER IS SWISH SOFTBELLY OF BLUE POND
THE CROWD WENT WILD MS TORT WENT UP TO SWISH AND GAVE HIM THE TURTLE CUP
SHE SAID SWISH YOU WERE THE YOUNGEST WINNER OF THE GREAT TURTLE RACE THAT WAS THE MOST EXCITING FINISH WE'VE EVER HAD
I THINK THAT YOU WILL BE A GREAT CHAMPION FOR MANY YEARS SINCE TURTLES ONLY GET SLOWER WITH AGE
FOR THE FIRST TIME IN SIX HUNDRED YEARS I WOULD LIKE TO PRESENT THE TURTLE CUP TO BLUE POND THE CROWD WENT WILD AGAIN
<unk> SWISH TOOK THE CUP THAT DAY FOR THE FIRST TIME HE WOULD TAKE IT MANY MORE TIMES AFTER THAT
<unk> IT WAS BECAUSE OF SWISH THAT BLUE POND BECAME THE MOST RESPECTED POND IN THE LAND
HE WOULD NEVER LOSE THE TURTLE CUP FOR THE REST OF HIS LONG LIFE
BUT THOUGH HE BECAME THE GREATEST AND BIGGEST TURTLE OF ALL TIME
MUCH GREATER OR BIGGER THAN MUD
HE <unk> ALWAYS MADE SURE THAT NO ONE TREATED HIM SPECIAL AND THAT HE TREATED EVERYBODY LIKE HE WANTED TO BE TREATED LIKE A TURTLE WITH HONOR
WELL THE STORY WAS ABOUT A RACE WHICH IN TURTLES MINDS THE WAY TO WIN THE RACE WAS TO BE THE SLOWEST AND IF YOU WON THE RACE BY BEING THE SLOWEST YOU WOULDN'T HAVE TO MOVE FOR THE NEXT FOUR YEARS UNTIL THE NEXT RACE AND
SIL
UHM
SIL
IT WAS ABOUT ONE YOUNG TURTLE BEATING ANOTHER TURTLE THAT HAD BEEN THE CHAMPION OF THE RACE FOR LIKE FIFTY YEARS
SIL
SHOULD I JUST RE TELL IT
SIL
THE STORY THE SLOWEST TURTLE IS ABOUT A YOUNG TURTLE AND A RACE THE RACE IS A GRAND TURTLE RACE THAT HAPPENS EVERY FOUR YEARS
AND THE WAY TO WIN WIN THIS RACE IS TO INSTEAD OF BEING FASTEST BE THE SLOWEST
SIL
AND THE
SIL
CHAMPION OF THIS RACE HAS BEEN THE CHAMPION FOR FIFTY YEARS AND THEN LATER ON A YOUNG TURTLE NAMED SWISH WAS BORN I THINK THAT'S HIS NAME <br> UHM
SIL
AND SWISH ENDS UP BEATING MUD WHO WAS THE FORMER CHAMPION FOR MORE THAN FIFTY YEARS AND THAT'S THEIR STORY
SIL
THE RACE IN THE STORY THE SLOWEST TURTLE
SIL
WAS VERY IT LASTED FROM
SIL
SUN UP TIL SUN DOWN AND UHM
SIL
MUD THE FORMER CHAMPION OF THE RACE AND SWISH THE UHM YOUNG TURTLE
SIL
WERE NECK AND NECK BOTH TIED FOR THE SLOWEST
SIL
AND UHM
SIL
THEN MUD STARTED TO TRY AND PLAY TRICKS ON SWISH <br>
THE FIRST TRICK THAT HE TRIED TO PLAY ON HIM WAS TRYING TO INTIMIDATE SWISH BUT SWISH'S FATHER BEFORE THE RACE HAD TOLD HIM NOT TO FALL FOR THIS SO HE OUTWITTED MUD BY NOT FALLING FOR IT
NEXT
SIL
MUD TRIED TO
SIL
HAVE SWISH DISOBEY THE RULES BY FALLING ASLEEP DURING THE RACE AND TRY TO SING HIM TO SLEEP
BUT HIS FATHER HAD ALSO WARNED HIM SWISH ABOUT MUD'S UH THAT <br> MUD'S TRICK
SIL
BUT EVEN THOUGH MUD TRIED TO SING
SIL
SWISH TO SLEEP SWISH GOT OUT EARPLUGS AND UHM
SIL
PUT THEM ON <br> WHILE MUD KEPT SINGING AND DIDN'T REALIZED THAT SWISH HAD THE EARPLUGS IN MUD SUNG HIMSELF TO SLEEP SO HE WAS DISQUALIFIED AND SWISH WON THE RACE
THE RED LEAVES WERE BLOWN AROUND IN MILLIONS BY THE WIND
HIS BOOTS CREAKED TOO SO LOUDLY BUT STILL HE WAS NOT AT ALL AFRAID
SIL
STILL SHE WILL BE GLAD TO SEE YOU BUT SHE HAS BEEN VERY BADLY FRIGHTENED
SIL
HE TURNED HIS BACK ON THE BOY AND CONFERRED <unk> ASIDE WITH LAWRENCE
SIL
I DESIRE IT SO MUCH THAT I WILL TAKE NO REFUSAL
SIL
AND THE PR PRIZE CUP GREW CLEARER AND NEARER TO HER MENTAL VISION
SIL
SIL
BEHIND LAY THE SHIP A PICTURE NOT WITHOUT ITS LIGHTER SIDE
SIL
AND MEANWHILE BY THE FURTHER RIVER BANK CAME ROSALIND WITH MUSHROOMS IN HER SKIRT
SIL
NOW GO AND ANSWER YOUR NOTE AND LET ME FINISH ITS SPLENDID LET ME FINISH THIS SPLENDID STORY
MORE COURAGE THAN MY POOR BROTHER WHO STANDS THERE LIKE A COWARD
SHE RUSH RUSHED FRANTICALLY ACROSS THE APARTMENT SIZED HER HOOD AND RAN FROM THE COTTAGE
THEY CARRY THEMSELVES AS FAST AS IF THEY HAD BEEN DRILLED BOTH MEN AND WOMEN
SIL
THE DAY
I FEAR I FEAR THAT WE SHALL HAVE ANOTHER SMART GALE HOWEVER IT WON'T LAST LONG
OF COURSE THERE'S NOTHING VERY ENTERTAINING HERE FOR YOU
THE YOUNGEST LINGERED FOR A MOMENT OR TWO WATCHING MYLES AT HIS WORK
SIL
SIL
THESE WORDS QUITE DESTROYED THE HOPE THAT OF LATE HAD BEEN GLOWING WITHIN HER
SIL
ITS FLAVOR WHEN COOKED IS MORE EXOTIC FAR THAN MUTTON OR OYSTER OR EGGS
SIL
SIL
I'M IN EARNEST HUCK JUST AS EARNEST AS EVER I WAS IN MY LIFE
HUMOR AND PATHOS PATHOS <unk> MAKE IT ALIVE AND YOU HAVE FOUND YOUR STYLE AT LAST
ETHEL BROWN WAS SEVEN YEARS OLD SHE HAD A TEA PARTY
SIL
SEAGRAVE KNELT BY HIS SIDE TOOK HIS HAND AND BURST INTO TEARS
SIL
NAN SAID IT WOULDN'T GROW IN OUR GARDEN BUT I BOUGHT SOME BROUGHT SOME HOME TO TRY
SIL
SIL
ROOSTER JOHN
<unk> BEFORE I TELL YOU HOW ROOSTER JOHN GOT HIS NAME YOU SHOULD KNOW A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE TOWN OF FRANKSVILLE
FRANKSVILLE WAS A TOWN THAT SEEMED TO HAVE ONE PROBLEM AFTER THE OTHER
<unk> THEIR PROBLEMS STARTED WHEN THEY RAN OUT OF WATER
THANKFULLY SOMEONE WAS DIGGING A HOLE AND FOUND WATER BUT SOON AFTER THEY STARTED TO GET FLIES
SIL
THEY GOT TONS AND TONS OF FLIES
SIL
THEN THE FLIES STOPPED BUT JUST THEN A MAN MOVED INTO TOWN WHO PLAYED THE FLUTE SO BADLY THAT PEOPLE WOULD RUN AWAY SCREAMING
<unk> MAYBE A POORLY PLAYED FLUTE DOESN'T SOUND AT ALL THAT BAD BUT JUST TRY TO IMAGINE SOMEONE SCRATCHING A CHALKBOARD WITH A FORK AND THEN MULTIPLYING THAT TIMES A HUNDRED
THAT'S HOW THE FLUTE SOUNDED WHEN THIS GUY PLAYED IT <unk> I'M SERIOUS
STILL IT'S NOT AS BAD AS MILLIONS OF FLIES I SUPPOSE
THE BAD FLUTE PLAYER WAS ROOSTER JOHN HE WASN'T CALLED ROOSTER JOHN YET <unk> THAT CAME LATER
HE WAS THE NEW TOWN DENTIST HE WAS AN EXCELLENT DENTIST BUT HIS REAL LOVE WAS MUSIC
<br> HE PLAYED MANY MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS SUCH AS THE GUITAR THE TUBA THE PIANO AND THE CLARINET <unk>
HOWEVER FOR SOME REASON THE WAY HIS MOUTH WAS SHAPED MADE HIS FLUTE SOUND AWFUL
SIL
WE CAN'T LET YOU PLAY THE FLUTE ANYMORE JOHN SAID POLICE SHERIFF SANDERS
THE NEIGHBORS ARE COMPLAINING AND THE CATS AND DOGS ARE TRYING TO CHEW OFF THEIR EARS
<br> BUT I HAVE TO PLAY I WAS BORN TO DO IT <unk> I DON'T KNOW WHY BUT I FEEL LIKE I HAVE TO OR ELSE BAD THINGS WILL HAPPEN
LOOK JOHN I'VE HEARD YOU PLAY THE CLARINET YOU'RE QUITE GOOD WHY DON'T YOU PLAY THAT INSTEAD SAID CHIEF SANDER SANDERS
OH THAT'S A NICE INSTRUMENT BUT IT JUST NOT THE FLUTE I EVEN WROTE YOU A SONG CHIEF SANDERS IT'S CALLED COPS AND ROBBERS
THEN HE PLAYED THE SONG THE POLICE CH CH CH CHE UH
SIL
UHM
SIL
THE POLICE CHIEF HATED THE SOUND SO MUCH THAT HE THREW JOHN IN JAIL
<br> BUT THEY COULDN'T KEEP JOHN IN JAIL SINCE HE WASN'T REALLY BREAKING ANY LAWS
SO THERE WAS NOTHING THE POLICE COULD DO <unk>
BESIDES EVERYBODY LOVED JOHN SINCE HE HAD BECOME THE TOWN DENTIST EVERYBODY'S TEETH WERE MUCH WHITER AND CLEANER AND NO ONE HAD ANY CAVITIES
SO THERE WAS A PROBLEM IN THE LITTLE TOWN OF FRANKSVILLE <unk>
WHAT SHOULD THEY DO THEY COULDN'T KEEP JOHN IN JAIL AND THEY DIDN'T WANT TO KICK HIM OUT OF THE OF TOWN BECAUSE THEY ALL HAD SUCH NICE TEETH
SO THEY DECIDED THAT JOHN COULD PLAY THE FLUTE AND EVERYBODY ELSE WOULD HAVE TO WEAR EARPLUGS
<unk> WELL I'M SURE YOU GUESSED THAT DIDN'T WORK
NO ONE COULD HEAR ANYTHING PEOPLE WERE GETTING INTO CAR ACCIDENTS AND EVERYBODY LOOKED REALLY SILLY AT DANCES DANCING TO MUSIC THEY COULDN'T HEAR
<br> THEY JUST COULDN'T
SIL
LEAD A NORMAL LIFE
<unk> THEN THEY DECIDED TO LOWER HIM DOWN A WELL AND LET HIM PLAY DOWN WHERE NO ONE COULD HEAR HIM
JOHN THOUGHT THAT WAS THAT WAS AN OK IDEA BUT THERE WAS AN ECHO IN THE WELL THAT MADE THE FLUTE SOUND LOUDER
<unk> WINDOWS WERE BREAKING ALL THE COWS IN TOWN STARTED TO MAKE SOUR MILK
THE LOCAL DENTIST DOCTOR WONG CAME UP WITH AN IDEA
<unk> HE THOUGHT THAT IF HE MADE A NEW MOUTHPIECE ESPECIALLY SHAPED FOR JOHN'S MOUTH THEN PERHAPS HE COULD PLAY THE FLUTE NORMALLY
AND GUESS WHAT IT WORKED DOCTOR WONG WAS THE TOWN HERO THE FLUTE SOUNDED NORMAL AND IT TURNED OUT JOHN COULD PLAY IT QUITE WELL
<br> THE PEOPLE IN TOWN DECIDED TO HAVE A GREAT BIG PARADE IN FRANKSVILLE AND CELEBRATE THE FACT THAT FOR NO
SIL
FOR ONCE THERE WAS NO WATER PROBLEM NO FLY FLY PROBLEM AND NO FLUTE PROBLEM
DOCTOR WONG AND JOHN WERE THE STARS OF THE PARADE THEY WERE UP IN THE MAIN FLOAT
A BIG BAND PLAYED AS THEY MARCHED UP AND DOWN MAIN STREET EVERYONE CHEERED
THEN SUDDENLY A FLY LANDED ON THE A LITTLE GIRL
THEN A FLY LANDED ON SOMEONE ELSE
THEN SOME LANDED ON A BUNCH OF PEOPLE AND PRETTY SOON TONS OF FLIES WERE LANDING ON EVERYONE BUT BEFORE THEY KNEW IT THE TOWN WAS FILLED WITH FLIES AGAIN
<unk> OH NO CRIED CHIEF CHERUB
SIL
UHM <unk> OH NO SAID CHIEF SANDERS JUST WHEN THINGS WERE GO GOING GOOD FOR FRANKSVILLE
JOHN DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO SO HE JUST KEPT ON PLAYING HIS FLUTE
<br> THEN FLIES WERE ANNOYING THE FLIES WERE ANNOYING SO HE WOULD SWAT THEM ALL WITH HIS HANDS OR EVEN HIS NEW FLUTE
<br> HE STARTED SHAKING THE FLUTE TO GET THE FLIES OFF AND ACCIDENTALLY SMASHED IT INTO PIECES
HE WAS VERY UPSET AT FIRST THEN HE SAID OH WELL GOOD THING I BROUGHT MY OLD FLUTE AS BACK UP
NO NO PLEASE DON'T PLAY YOUR OLD FLUTE BEGGED DOCTOR WONG BUT IT WAS TOO LATE JOHN HAD STARTED PLAYING
WHEN THE TOWNSFOLK HEARD THE NOISE THEY COULDN'T EVEN SWAT THE FLIES ANYMORE
<br>
THEY HAD TO COVER THEIR EARS FROM THE HORRIBLE SOUND
THE FLIES WOULD LAND ALL OVER THE PEOPLE AND THEY COULDN'T SWAT THEM OFF IT WAS GROSS THEN SUDDENLY THE FLIES FLEW AWAY FAST AS THEY COULD
DOCTOR WONG THOUGHT FOR A SECOND THEN PRONOUNCED IT'S THE FLUTE SOUND THE FLIES HATE JOHN'S FLUTE PLAYING AS MUCH AS WE DO
JOHN'S DENTIST WAS DRIVING THE FLIES AWAY
<br> IT WAS THEN THAT PEOPLE OF FRANKSVILLE REALIZED THAT THEY WOULD HAVE TO TAKE A GOOD WITH TAKE THE GOOD WITH THE BAD
BECAUSE AS BAD AS THE FLUTE SOUNDED IT WAS A LOT BETTER THAN THOUSANDS OF FLIES CRAWLING ON THEM
FROM THEN ON JOHN WOULD WAKE UP AT SUNRISE LIKE A ROOSTER AND PLAY TO KEEP H THE FLIES AWAY
OK <br> SO ROOSTER JOHN WAS ABOUT UHM UH THIS TOWN WHERE EVERYTHING WENT WRONG AND UHM THERE WAS FLIES A LOT OF FLIES AND THEY WOULD BUG THE PEOPLE
AND UHM THEN THERE THERE WAS ROOSTER JOHN AND UHM HE PLAYED INSTRUMENTS AND HE WAS A THE DENTIST FOR THE PEOPLE IN FRANKSVILLE AND UHM
SIL
UHM HE WOULD PLAY LIKE THE CLARINET AND THE TU TUBA OR SOMETHING I LIKE LOTS OF DIFFERENT INSTRUMENTS
AND THEN HE WOULD PLAY THE FLUTE BUT HE WAS REALLY BAD AT PLAYING THE FLUTE AND UHM IT SOUNDED LIKE LIKE A FORK ON A CHALKBOARD
SIL
AND UHM SO
SIL
UHM THE DEN THE NOBODY LIKED TO HEAR IT AND
SIL
SO UHM THE DENTIST UHM MISTER
SIL
MONG OR SOMETHING <br> UHM HE MADE HE WAS A DENTIST TOO AND SO HE MADE THE ROOSTER JOHN A A SPECIAL MOUTHPIECE FOR HIS FLUTE
AND UHM THEN IT HE SOUNDED NORMAL AND HE WAS PRETTY GOOD AND BUT AND THEN SO THEY HAD A PARADE
AND UHM THEY WERE IN THE HEAD OF THE
SIL
PARADE THEY WERE LIKE ON A BIG FLOAT OF SOMETHING <br> AND UHM
SIL
HE STARTED PLAYING THE FLUTE AND ALL THESE THE THE FLIES STARTING LANDING ON THE PEOPLE THAT WERE WATCHING THE PARADE AND THEN
SIL
SO SO SOMETHING HAPPENED TO HIS FLUTE AND SO HE GOT OUT HIS OLD ONE AND UHM HE STARTED TO PLAY THAT ONE AND IT SOUNDED SO BAD THAT THE ALL THE FLIES FLEW AWAY
CAUSE THEY DIDN'T LIKE THE NOISE OF THE FLUTE EITHER
SO EVERY MORNING UHM ROOSTER JOHN GETS UP AND PLAYS THE HI THE FLUTE THAT SOUNDS BAD IN THE MORNING AND ALL THE FLIES GO AWAY
AFTER THE USUAL CEREMONIES THE PRINCE PRESENTED HIS PROPOSAL
BUT I AM TOO OLD TO ENDURE YOUR SHAME AND MY MISERY MUCH LONGER
RATHER WOULD I FACE THREE STRONG MEN THAN ONE YOUNG DAMSEL
I WOULD LOVE DEARLY TO HEAR THESE PEOPLE DESCRIBE THEIR TRAVELS
THROUGHOUT THESE CONVERSATIONS SAM HODGE SELDOM SPOKE
NOW HE HAS GONE OFF AGAIN FOR THE GAME IS GETTING SCARCE
YES MY LORD SAID THE MAN HIS SUNBURNED FACE REDDENING
EVEN IF THERE HAS BEEN SOME LITTLE MISTAKE WHAT COULD I DO NOW TO FIX IT
FOR SEVERAL DAYS THIS STRANGELY ASSORTED PAIR ROAMED THE JUNGLE TOGETHER
THE EARL LOOKED AT IT AND THE CORNERS OF HIS MOUTH TWITCHED A LITTLE
SIL
SIL
IF GOD SPARES BETH I WILL NEVER I NEVER WILL COMPLAIN AGAIN WHISPERED MEG EARNESTLY
THESE THOUGHTS HAUNTED HIM ALL DAY AND HE DREAMT THEM ALL NIGHT
SIL
FOR NOTHING BRINGS JOY TO THE HEART LIKE THE COMING OF SPRING
SIL
SHE COULD SEE NOTHING EXCEPT THE MORNING GLORIES WHICH COVERED THE SIDE OF THE PORCH
SIL
WE NEVER KNEW THAT STRANGE PEOPLE EXISTED ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD
SIL
FOR YOU AND ME THERE IS NOTHING TO HOPE FOR NOTHING BEYOND WHAT WE HAVE
SHE MUST BEGIN WITH THE CHINESE DYNASTY AND END WITH JAPAN
IN THE DEEP GLOOM SHE COULD NOT SEE THE ANGER WHICH DARKENED HIS FACE
SIL
DIANA SEARCHED FAITHFULLY BUT NO AXE WAS TO BE FOUND IN THE WHOLE WOODSHED
SIL
SHE WANTS TO GIVE THAT BOY AN EXTREMELY BAD OPINION OF ME
I KNOW THE COUNTY STOCK LAW JUST AS WELL AS YOU DO
HOW STRANGE THAT A LIVE ANIMAL SHOULD GROW ON A STALK LIKE A FLOWER
SIL
I GUESS I'LL BUY A FEW SNAKES SINCE THEY LOOK SO FUNNY COILING OUT
SEE THE WISDOM OF MY CHOICE HE SAID HOLDING UP THE LARGE LEAF OF GOLD
SIL
<unk> DEAR MOM AND DAD PARENTS
SINCE YOU HAVE GROUNDED ME AND TOLD ME TO WRITE DOWN WHY I AM SORRY BEFORE I WAS ALLOWED OUT OF MY ROOM I AM MAD AT YOU
<br> I WOULD LIKE TO START BY SAYING THAT I THINK THAT YOU ARE VERY MEAN TO MAKE ME DO THIS BECAUSE IT WASN'T EVEN MY FAULT
I COULDN'T HELP IT ANYWAY IT WAS AN ACCIDENT AND I DIDN'T EVEN DO IT ON PURPOSE
I REALLY DIDN'T MEAN TO SHAVE THE CAT REALLY I SWEAR
OK HERE'S WHAT HAPPENED AS I REMEMBER IT
I SAW THE CAT WAS TRYING TO GET THE GERBILS AND YOU TOLD US WE COULDN'T HIT ANIMALS SO I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT ELSE TO DO
SO I GRABBED DAD'S NOSE HAIR CLIPPERS AND SHAVED IT
YOU SHOULD BE PROUD OF ME FOR THINKING SO FAST ON MY TOES
OH SURE IT'S EASY TO SAY THAT I SHOULD HAVE JUST PICKED THE CAT UP BUT SOMETIMES WE DON'T ALWAYS THINK ALL THAT GREAT UNDER PRESSURE
AND YOU KNOW WHAT THOSE STUPID GERBILS DIDN'T EVEN THANK ME THEY JUST RAN ON THAT STUPID WHEEL AND DID STUPID THINGS
THAT'S THE LAST TIME I EVER SHAVE THE CAT TO PROTECT ANY STUPID GERBILS
BESIDES THE REAL REASON I SHAVED THE CAT WAS TO KEEP IT NICE AND COOL
I JUST DIDN'T WANT TO SEE THE CAT GETTING ALL HOT AND UNCOMFORTABLE AND STUFF
YOU GUYS WILL PROBABLY SAY YOU GUYS WILL JUST PROBABLY SAY IT'S WINTER DANNY CATS DON'T OVERHEAT IN WINTER
BUT SO WHAT IF IT'S WINTER
I MEAN IT'LL BE SUMMER SOON ENOUGH AND I JUST WANTED THE CAT TO GET USED TO THE IDEA BEFORE IT GETS GOT REALLY HOT
PLUS OSCAR MY TURTLE TOLD ME TO SHAVE THE CAT
FINE OSCAR CAN'T REALLY TALK BUT IF HE COULD HE WOULD HAVE SAID PLEASE SHAVE THE CAT
IT KEEPS HITTING ME ON THE SHELL AND TRYING TO ROLL ME OVER WHEN YOU LEAVE THE ROOM
YOU GUYS NEVER LIKED OSCAR AS MUCH AS THE CAT ANYWAY
YOU WOULDN'T ALWAYS TAKE THE CAT'S SIDE IF YOU KNEW THE STUFF HE DID TO MY POOR TURTLE
CATS AREN'T ALWAYS NICE JUST LIKE MY SISTER JENNY ISN'T ALWAYS NICE
BUT THE REAL REASON I SHAVED THE CAT WAS TO MAKE A WIG FOR THOSE POOR HAIR LESS CATS THAT WE SAW ON TV ON THE ANIMAL CHANNEL
I KNEW OUR CAT WOULD GROW HER FUR BACK BUT SOME CATS DON'T HAVE HAIR
THEY ARE ALL HAIRLESS CAT THEY ARE CALLED HAIR LESS CATS AND THEY NEED FUR IN THE WINTER SOMETIMES I THINK I SWEAR THAT'S THE REASON
ALSO I WAS GOING TO SELL THE CAT FUR AND BUY MY SISTER JENNY BRACES FOR HER BIG STUPID FACE
PLUS I FORGOT TO TELL YOU THAT YOU SHOULD BE BLAMING MS CASPER MY SCIENCE TEACHER
SHE MADE US SHAVE SOMETHING FOR SCIENCE ASK HER
SIL
SHE SAID THAT WHEN WE SHAVE HAIR IT GROWS BACK HARDER AND SOMETIMES EVEN DARKER
SO I THOUGHT THAT IF I COULD SHAVE THE CAT A LOT OF OF BUN A BUNCH OF TIMES HER HAIR WOULD GROW BACK HARDER EACH TIME AND SOON SHE WOULD HAVE AN INVINCIBLE COAT OF CAT FUR ARMOR
THEN SHE WOULD BE A SUPER CAT AND YOU COULD TAKE HER ON TV SHOWS AND GET LOTS OF MONEY SO THAT YOU CAN SEND JENNY TO COLLEGE EVEN IF SHE IS A DUMB LITTLE TATTLE TALE
SHE'S SO GOOD AT SCHOOL AND YOU BOUGHT HER A CAT CAUSE SHE'S JUST SO RESPONSIBLE AND STUFF
JUST CAUSE SHE'S A GOOD STUDENT DOESN'T MEAN SHE'S REALLY RESPONSIBLE
LAST NIGHT I SAW THAT SHE DIDN'T BRUSH HER TEETH OH YEAH I FORGOT TO TELL YOU THAT
<unk> DEAR MOM AND DAD JENNY DIDN'T BRUSH HER TEETH LAST NIGHT
I THINK THAT SHE SHOULD BRUSH HER TEETH TWICE TONIGHT <unk> THAT'S JUST MY OPINION THOUGH
I'LL BET YOU DIDN'T KNOW SOMETHING ELSE DID YOU KNOW THAT I WANTED TO BE A BARBER
I WAS AFRAID TO TELL YOU THE REAL REASON I SHAVED THE CAT WAS THAT I WANT TO BE A BARBER AND I NEEDED PRACTICE
I WAS AFRAID YOU WOULDN'T LET ME PRACTICE ON MY OWN HEAD CAN I PRACTICE BY SHAVING JENNY'S HEAD
I PROMISE THAT I'LL DO A BETTER JOB THEN I DID ON THE CAT CAUSE NOW I HAVE WHAT DAD CALLS LIFE EXPERIENCE NOT THAT I SHAVED THE CAT THOUGH
ACTUALLY THE TRUTH IS THAT I BY ACCIDENT TURNED ON THE NOSE HAIR CLIPPERS AND THE CAT WAS BEING CHASED BY THE TURTLE AND RAN RIGHT BY THE CLIPPERS AND SHAVED HERSELF
I KEPT SAYING NO KITTY NO DON'T SHAVE YOURSELF BUT MY STUPID SISTER NEVER TAUGHT HER CAT HOW TO LISTEN
SO SHE JUST IGNORED ME SEE SHE'S NOT SO RESPONSIBLE AFTER ALL
IF I HAD A CAT I KNOW I WOULD TEACH IT NOT SHAVE ITSELF THAT'S FOR SURE
I DON'T HAVE TO GET GOOD GRADES TO KNOW THAT YOU SHOULD TEACH A CAT TO SHAVE ITSELF
SIL
PLUS IF YOU WEREN'T ALWAYS CUDDLING WITH MY SISTER SO MUCH MAYBE SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN WITH HER CAT
INSTEAD THE CAT CAME INTO MY ROOM BECAUSE JENNY NEVER PLAYS WITH IT ENOUGH
THE CAT LIKED BEING SHAVED ANYWAY SO I DON'T SEE THE BIG DEAL
I THINK IT REALLY LIKED ITS HAIRCUT
THE ONLY REASON IT HASN'T COME OUT FOR TWO WEEKS IS BECAUSE YOU GUYS KEEP MAKING SUCH A BIG DEAL ABOUT IT
POOR KITTY THIS AND POOR KITTY THAT IT'S YOUR FAULT REALLY
DAD PLEASE DON'T READ THE NEXT PART
DEAR MOM DON'T LET DAD KNOW THAT THE REAL REASON I SHAVED THE CAT WAS THAT HE'S ALWAYS SNEEZING AROUND IT
I KNOW HOW MUCH YOU HATE HIM SNEEZING AND STUFF SO I THOUGHT IF I GOT RID OF HIS FUR HE WOULDN'T SNEEZE AND THAT YOU'D HAVE A BETTER MARRIAGE
SO IT WAS REALLY MY FATHER'S DAY GIFT TO HIM
<unk> I COULDN'T BUY HIM ANYTHING NICE SINCE YOU TOOK AWAY MY ALLOWANCE FOR WHEN I SHAVED THE NEIGHBOR'S DOG
HOW COME JENNY GETS A CAT AND I GET A STUPID TURTLE ANYWAY
TURTLES DON'T DO ANYTHING EXCEPT POKE THEIR HEADS OUT AND NOT BE NOT CUDDLY
CAN I GET A DOG PLEASE
SO IN CONCLUSION I'M GETTING HUNGRY AND I'M SORRY FOR SHAVING THE CAT
ALTHOUGH YOU CAN SEE THAT IT'S REALLY JENNY'S FAULT FOR NOT BEING AS RESPONSIBLE AS YOU ALWAYS SAY AND NOT BRUSHING HER TEETH
PS IF YOU WOULD'VE BOUGHT HER A TURTLE I COULDN'T HAVE SHAVED IT
SINCERELY DANNY
UHM IT'S ABOUT A BOY WHO SHAVED HIS CAT AND HE'S WRITING TO HIS PARENTS TO TELL THEM WHY HE DID IT
SIL
UHM THAT HIS SISTER WASN'T RESPONSIBLE ENOUGH AND THAT HIS DAD WAS SNEEZING AND THAT HE WANTED TO GIVE THE HAIR OF TO ONE OF HIS FURLESS CAT AND THAT UHM THE CAT WAS ALWAYS WELL THE CAT WAS GOING AFTER HIS GERBIL AND SO HE WANTED TO STOP IT WITHOUT HITTING IT

SINCE YOU HAVE GROUNDED ME AND TOLD ME TO WRITE DOWN WHY I AM SORRY BEFORE I WAS ALLOWED OUT OF MY ROOM I AM MAD AT YOU
I WOULD LIKE TO START BY SAYING THAT I THINK YOU ARE A VERY MEAN TO MAKE ME DO THIS BECAUSE WASN'T EVEN MY FAULT
I COULDN'T HELP IT ANYWAY IT WAS AN ACCIDENT AND I DIDN'T EVEN DO IT ON PURPOSE
<br> I REALLY DIDN'T MEAN TO SHAVE THE CAT REALLY I SWEAR

I SAW THAT THE CAT WAS TRYING TO GET I GET THE GERBILS AND TOLD AND TOLD AND YOU TOLD US WE COULDN'T HIT HIM
SO YOU SO YOU I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT ELSE I COULD DO
SO I GRABBED DAD'S NOSE HAIR CLIPPERS AND SHAVED IT
<br> YOU COULD BE PROUD OF ME FOR THINKING SO FAST ON MY TOES
OH SURE IT'S EASY TO SAY THAT <unk> I SHOULD HAVE JUST PICKED UP THE CAT UP PUT PICKED THE CAT UP BUT SOMETIMES WE DON'T ALWAYS THINK THAT GREAT
SIL

AND AND YOU KNOW WHAT THOSE STUPID GERBILS DIDN'T EVEN THANK ME THEY JUST RAN ON THAT STUPID WHEEL AND DIDN'T
SIL
AND DID STUPID THINGS
THAT IS THE LAST TIME I THAT IS THE LAST TIME I SHAVE THE CAT TO THE P TO THE PROJECT ANY STUPID GERBILS
BESIDES THE REAL REASON I SHAVED THE CAT WAS TO KEEP IT NICE AND COOL
I JUST DIDN'T WANT TO SEE THE CAT GETTING ALL THE ALL THE HOT AND UNCOMFORTABLE STUFF
YOU GUYS WILL JUST PROBABLY SAY IT'S WINTER DANNY CATS DON'T OVERHEAT IN WINTER

PLUS OSCAR MY TURTLE TOLD ME TO SHAVE THE CAT
FINE OSCAR CAN'T REALLY TALK BUT IF HE COULD HE WOULD HAVE SAID
PLEASE SHAVE THE CAT IT KEEPS HITTING ME ON THE SHELL AND TRYING TO ROLL ME OVER WHEN YOU LEAVE THE ROOM
YOU GUYS NEVER LIKED OSCAR AS MUCH AS THE CAT ANYWAY
<br> YOU WOULDN'T ALWAYS TAKE THE CAT'S SIDE <unk> YOU WOULD ALWAYS TAKE THE CAT'S SIDE IF YOU KNEW THE STUFF HE DID TO MY POOR TURTLE
CAT'S AREN'T ALWAYS NICE JUST LIKE MY LITTLE S SISTER JENNY ISN'T ALWAYS NICE
<br> BUT THE REALEST REASON I SHAVED THE CAT WAS TO MAKE A WIG FOR THOSE POOR HAIR LESS CATS THAT WE SAW ON TV ON THE ANIMAL CHANNEL
<br> I KNEW OUR CAT WOULD GROW HER FUR BACK
BUT SOMETIMES C BUT SOME CATS DON'T HAVE HAIR
THEY'RE ARE CALLED HAIRLESS CATS AND THEY NEED FUR IN THE WINTER SOME SOMETIMES I THINK I I SWEAR THAT'S THE REASON
I ALSO WAS GOING TO SELL THE CAT'S FUR TO BUY MY SISTER JENNY BRACES FOR HER BIG STUPID FACE
<br> PLUS I FORGOT TO TELL YOU THAT SHE THAT YOU SHOULD BLAME MS CASPER MY S MY TEACHER

PLUS IF YOU WEREN'T ALWAYS CUDDLING WITH MY SISTER SO MUCH MAYBE SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN WITH HER CAT

THE CAT LIKED BEING SHAVED ANYWAY SO I DON'T THINK SEE THE BIG DEAL

DAD PLEASE DON'T READ THE NEXT PART
DEAR MOM DON'T LET DAD KNOW THE REAL REASON I SHAVED THE CAT WAS THAT HE AL HE'S ALWAYS SNEEZING AROUND IT

SIL
SIL
THE FIRST TIME I EVER TOOK AN AIRPLANE BY MYSELF IT WAS FUN AND SCARY
I DIDN'T KNOW ANYONE AT ALL AND I HAD TO GO ALL THE WAY FROM NEW YORK TO TEXAS WITHOUT MY PARENTS
I WAS FLYING THERE TO SEE MY GRANDFATHER AND WE WERE GOING TO GO FISHING
I'VE ALWAYS THOUGHT FLYING WAS FUN YOU GO HIGHER TH THAN ANY MOUNTAIN AND GO FASTER THAN ANY CAR
BUT TO TELL YOU THE T BUT TO TELL THE TRUTH WITHOUT MY PARENTS THERE I WAS PRETTY NERVOUS
I GUESS IT WAS BECAUSE THE PLANE WAS SO LOUD AND I DIDN'T KNOW ANYONE
I STARTED THINKING WE MIGHT CRASH I DIDN'T LIKE TO THINK ABOUT THAT BUT I COULDN'T HELP IT
<unk> THAT'S WHEN THAT'S WHEN I MISSED THE P MY PARENTS THE MOST
BUT ONCE THE PLANE WAS IN THE AIR I WAS PRETTY GOOD
<unk> MY MOM GAVE ME A COLORING BOOK A OF COOL LOOKING DRAGON TO KEEP ME BUSY
I COLORED THE DRAGON PICTURES ALL GREEN SO IT DIDN'T TAKE VERY LONG
I COL THE O I ONLY USED THE GREEN CRAYON BECAUSE IT WAS THE TALLEST AND I WANTED IT TO CATCH UP T TO THE RED BLUE YELLOW AND PURPLE AND BLACK ONES
<unk> ONE THING ABOUT BEING BY YOURSELF ON AN AIRPLANE IS THAT THE FLIGHT ATTENDANTS ARE VERY NICE TO YOU
I HAD SEVEN COLAS AND FOUR GINGER ALES WHICH MADE ME HAD TO GO TO THE BATHROOM EIGHT TIMES <unk>
I WAS GLAD THAT THERE WASN'T ANYBODY NEXT TO ME
<unk> THE PERSON NEXT TO ME WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY ANNOYED <unk>
<unk> EVENTUALLY THE FLIGHT ATTENDANT SEEMED TO GO GET A LITTLE ANNOYED THAT I HAD TO GO TO THE BATHROOM SO MUCH
BUT IT WAS HER FAULT SHE WAS THE ONE WHO KEPT TRYING TO GIVE ME PEANUTS
I TOLD HER THAT I WANTED A BANANA SPLIT INSTEAD SHE INSTEAD BUT SHE SAID WE DON'T HAVE BANANA SPLITS ON A PLANE
IT WAS THE PEANUTS THAT WERE MAKING ME SO THIRSTY IN THE FIRST PLACE
SO THAT IF SHE WOULD GET ME A BA SO IF SHE WOULDN'T BANANA SPLIT I WOULDN'T HAVE TO GO THE BATHROOM SO MUCH
OR IF SHE WOULD GET ME A BANANA SPLIT I WOULDN'T HAVE TO GO THE BATHROOM SO MUCH
SHE TOLD ME TO BE QUIET AND WATCH THE MOVIE
<unk> I I TRIED TO WATCH THE MOVIE BUT I HAD ALREADY SEEN
SIL
THAT ONE WAS SO B I HAD ALREADY SEEN THAT ONE SO IT WAS BORING
THE FLIGHT ATTENDANT GAVE ME A DECK OF CARDS BUT SHE WOULDN'T PLAY GO FISH WITH ME
SHE SAID THAT SHE HAD TO HELP OTHER PASSENGERS <unk>
I HAD A GAME BOY IN MY BACKPACK MY BACKPACK WAS THE O WAS IN THE OVERHEAD THINGY
I TRIED TO PUSH THE BUTTON THAT LIGHTS UP I TRIED TO PUSH THE BUTTON THAT LIGHTS OVER UP OVER MY HEAD SO THE FLIGHT ATTENDANT WOULD COME
BUT GUESS WHAT I WAS TOO SHORT TO S UHM REACH THE BUTTON
SO I STARTED YELLING HEY PEANUT LADY HEY PEANUT LADY
SHE DIDN'T LIKE CALLED BE SHE DIDN'T LIKE BEING CALLED PEANUT LADY BUT SHE DID GET MY GAME BOY
<br> SHE TOLD ME TO CALL HER JENNIFER INSTEAD
I PLAYED ON MY GAME BOY UNTIL I GOT TO NEW UNTIL I GOT A NEW HIGH SCORE THEN JENNIFER CAME THEN J JENNIFER CAME UP TO ME AND SAID SHE WAS SHE HAD A SURPRISE
I THOUGHT GREAT MORE PEANUTS
BUT IT WASN'T PEANUTS IT WAS SOMETHING REALLY COOL
SHE SAID THE CAPTAIN WAS INVITING ME TO THE COCKPIT
<unk> I THOUGHT AWESOME HE ALSO I ALSO BROUGHT MY DECK OF CARDS IN CASE THE PILOT WAS BORED AND WANTED TO PLAY GO FISH
<br> JENNIFER TOOK ME TO THE COCKPIT AND THERE WAS WHERE THERE WAS A MILLION BUTTONS AND LEVERS AND KNOBS AND STUFF
AT FIRST I THOUGHT WOW LOOK AT ALL THOSE BUTTONS THEN I THOUGHT
THERE'S NO WAY I A THERE'S NO WAY ANYONE CAN REMEMBER TO PUSH ALL THOSE BUTTONS AT THE RIGHTS TIME WE ARE GOING TO CRASH
<unk> THE W THAT WAY I FIGURED IT OUT
<unk> THAT'S THE WAY I FIGURED IT MY MY GAME MY GAME BOY ONLY HAS FIVE BUTTONS AND I CAN'T G B GET PAST LEVEL THREE
IMAGINE HOW HARD IT WOULD TO BE WORK THOSE MILLIONS OF BUTTONS AND EAT PEANUTS
<unk> THE PILOT TOLD ME THERE THAT HE WASN'T REALLY THAT IT WASN'T REALLY THAT HARD ONCE YOU PRACTICED
THEN HE TOLD ME THAT HE ONCE PLAYED A GAME BOY
SIL
THAT HE ONCE PLAYED THE GAME I HAD ON MY GAME BOY BUT HE COULDN'T EVEN PASS LEVEL ONE
I SAID IF YOU CAN'T GET EVEN PAST LEVEL ONE THEN AND YOU'RE A PILOT THEN I COULD BE A PILOT TOO SINCE I'M MUCH BETTER AT PUSHING BUTTONS THAN YOU ARE
HE LAUGHED EVEN THOUGH IT WASN'T JOKING JOKING
HE SAID THAT I WOULD MAKE A UHM VERY GOOD PILOT SOMEDAY IF I WANTED TO BE
HE WAS REALLY NICE BUT HE BUT HE WOULDN'T PLAY GO FISH WITH ME
FINALLY WE LANDED <unk> THAT WAS SCARY
IT SEEMS LIKE THE PLANE WAS GOING SO FAST TO EVER STOP BUT IT SEEMS LIKE THE PLANES GOING TOO FAST TO EVER STOP BUT IT DOES
<br> WHEN I GET OFF THE AIRPLANE THERE WAS GRANDPA WAITING FOR ME HE SAID
HOW WAS YOUR FLIGHT I SAID SOMEDAY I'M GOING TO BE A PILOT AND I'M ONLY SERVE BANANA SPLITS ON MY PLANE
GRANDPA LAUGHED AND TOOK ME STRAIGHT TO THE ICE CREAM SHOP
IT WAS WORTH THE WHOLE TRIP JUST TO EAT A BANANA SPLIT WITH GRANDPA

SIL
SHE WILL BE GLAD TO SEE YOU BUT SHE HAS B BEEN VERY B BADLY FRIGHTENED
SIL
DEAR MOM AND DAD
SINCE YOU HAVE GROUNDED ME AND TOLD ME TO WRITE DOWN WHY I AM SORRY BEFORE I WAS ALLOWED OUT OF MY ROOM I AM MAD AT YOU
I WOULD LIKE TO START BY SAYING THAT I THINK THAT YOU ARE VERY MEAN TO MAKE ME DO THIS BECAUSE IT WASN'T EVEN MY FAULT
I COULDN'T HELP IT ANYWAY IT WAS AN ACCIDENT AND I DIDN'T EVEN DO IT ON PURPOSE
I REALLY DIDN'T MEAN TO S SHAVE THAT THE CAT REALLY I SWEAR
OK HERE'S WHAT HAPPENED AS I REMEMBER IT
I SAW THE CAT WAS TRYING TO GET TO GET THE GERBILS AND YOU TOLD US WE COULDN'T HIT ANIMALS SO I DIDN'T
I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT ELSE TO DO SO I GRABBED DAD'S NOSE HAIR C CLIPPERS AND SHAVED IT
YOU SHOULD BE PROUD OF ME FOR THINKING SO FAST ON MY TOES
OH SURE IT'S EASY TO SAY THAT I SHOULD HAVE JUST PICKED UP THE CAT BUT SOMETIMES WE DON'T ALWAYS THINK ALL THAT GREAT UNDER PRESSURE
AND YOU KNOW WHAT <unk> THOSE STUPID GERBILS DIDN'T EVEN THANK ME
THEY JUST RA RAN ON IN THE STUPID WHEEL AND DID STUPID THINGS
THAT'S THE LAST TIME I SHAVE THE CAT TO PROTECT ANY STUPID GERBILS
I JUST DIDN'T WANT TO SEE THE CAT GETTING ALL HOT AND UNCOMFORTABLE AND STUFF
YOU GUYS WILL JUST PROBABLY SAY IT'S WINTER DANNY <unk> CATS DON'T OVERHEAT IN WINTER
BUT SO WHAT IF IT'S WINTER
I MEAN IT'S BE SU IT'LL BE SUMMER SOON ENOUGH AND I JUST WANTED THE CAT TO GET S GET USED TO THE IDEA BEFORE IT REALLY GOT HOT
PLUS OSCAR PLUS OSCAR MY TURTLE TOLD ME TO SHAVE THE CAT
<unk> FI FINE OSCAR CAN'T REALLY TALK BUT IF HE COULD HE WOULD HAVE SAID
PLEASE SHAVE THE CAT IT KEEPS HITTING ON MY SHELL AND TRYING TO ROLL ME OVER WHEN WHEN YOU LEAVE THE ROOM
YOU GUYS NEVER LIKED OSCAR AS MUCH AS THE CAT ANYWAY
YOU WOULDN'T ALWAYS TAKE THE CAT'S SI YOU WOULD AL YOU WOULDN'T ALWAYS TAKE THE CAT'S SIDE IF YOU KNEW THE STUFF HE DID TO POOR TURTLE TO MY POOR TURTLE
CAT'S AREN'T ALWAYS NICE JUST LIKE MY SISTER JENNY ISN'T ALWAYS NICE
BUT THE REAL REASON I SHAVED THE CAT WAS TO MAKE A WIG FOR THOSE POOR HAIR LESS CATS
SIL
THAT WE SEE ON TV ON THE ANIMAL CH CHANNEL
<unk> I KNEW OUR CAT WOULD GROW HER FUR BACK BUT SOME CATS DON'T HAVE HAIR
THEY ARE CALLED HAIRLESS CATS AND <unk> AND THEY NEED FUR IN THE WINTER SOMETIMES I THINK I SWEAR THAT'S THE REASON
ALSO I AM GOING TO SELL THE CAT FUR AND BUY MY SISTER JENNY BRACES FOR HER BIG STUPID FACE
PLUS I I FORGOT TO TELL YOU THAT
SIL
THAT YOU SHOULD BE BLAMING MS CASPER MY SCIENCE TEACHER SHE MADE MADE US SHAVE SOMETHING FOR SCIENCE
ASK HER SHE SAID THAT SH THAT WHEN WE SHAVE HAIR IT GROWS BACK HARDER SOMETIMES EVEN DARKER
SO I THOUGHT THAT IF I COULD SHAVE THE CAT A LOT OF A BUNCH OF TIMES
HE HER HAIR WOULD GROW BACK HARDER EACH TIME AND SOON SHE WOULD HAVE AN INVINCIBLE COAT OF CAT FUR ARMOR
THEN SHE WOULD BE A SUPER CAT AND YOU COULD TAKE HER ON TV SHOWS AND GET LOTS OF MONEY SO THAT YOU CAN BUY JENNY'S COLLEGE
EVEN IF SHE IS DUMB LITTLE TATTLE'TALE
SHE'S S SHE'S SO GOOD AT SCHOOL AND YOU BROUGHT ME SHE
SIL
YOU BOUGHT MEAN SHE'S REALLY HER CAT IT CAUSE SHE'S SO RESPONSIBLE AND STU AND STUFF
JUST CAUSE SHE'S A GOOD STUDENT DOESN'T MEAN SHE'S REALLY RESPONSIBLE
LAST NIGHT I SAW THAT SHE DIDN'T BRUSH HER TEETH OH YEAH I FORGOT TO TELL YOU THAT
<unk> DEAR MOM AND DAD JENNY DIDN'T BRUSH HER TEETH LAST NIGHT I THINK THAT YOU SHOULD
SIL
I THINK THAT SHE SHOULD BRUSH HER TEETH TWICE TONIGHT
THAT'S JUST MY OPINION THOUGH
I'LL BET YOU DIDN'T KNOW SOMETHING ELSE
DID YOU KNOW THAT I WANTED TO BE A BARBER
I WAS AFRAID TO TELL YOU THE REAL REASON I SHAVED THE CAT WAS THAT BECAUSE I WANT TO BE A BARBER AND I NEEDED PRACTICE
I WAS
SIL
AFRAID THAT YOU WOULDN'T LET ME PRACTICE ON MY OWN HEAD
I CAN PRACTICE BY SHAVING JENNY'S HEAD
I'LL PROMISE THAT I'LL DO BETTER JOB THEN I DID ON THE CAT BECAUSE NOW I HAVE WHAT DAD CALLS LIFE EXPERIENCE
NOT THAT I SHAVED THE CAT THOUGH
ACTUALLY THE TRUTH IS TH THAT BY A I I I BY ACCIDENT TURNED ON THE NOSE HAIR CLIP CLIP CLIPPERS
AND THE CAT WAS BEING CHASED BY THE TURTLE AND RAN RIGHT BY THE CLIPPERS AND SHAVED HERSELF
I KEPT SAYING NO KITTY NO DON'T SHAVE YOURSELF
BUT MY STUPID SISTER NEVER TAUGHT HER CAT HOW TO LISTEN SO SHE JUST IGNORED ME
SEE SHE'S NOT RESPONSIBLE AFTER ALL
IF I HAD A CAT I KNOW THAT YOU SHOULD TEACH A CAT TO SHAVE ITSELF
<unk> PLUS IF YOU WEREN'T ALWAYS CUDDLING WITH MY SISTER SO MUCH MAYBE YOU WOULD HAVE BEEN WITH THE WITH HER CAT
INSTEAD THE THE CAT CAME INTO MY ROOM BECAUSE JENNY NEVER PLAYS WITH IT LI
SIL
ENOUGH
THE CAT LIKED BEING SHAVED ANYWAY SO I DIDN'T SEE THE BIG DEAL
I THINK IT REALLY LIKES THE ITS HAIRCUT
THE ONLY REASON IT IT HASN'T COME OUT F FOR TWO WEEKS IS BECAUSE YOU GUYS MADE SUCH A BIG DEAL OUT OF IT POOR KITTY AND THAT A THIS AND POOR KITTY THAT
IT'S YOUR FAULT REALLY
<unk>
DAD PLEASE DON'T READ THE NEXT PART
DEAR MOM DON'T LET DAD KNOW THE REAL REASON I SHAVED THE CAT WAS BECAUSE ALWAYS SNEEZING AROUND IT
I I KNOW HOW MUCH YOU HATE HIM ALWAYS SNEEZING AND SO I THOUGHT IF I GOT RID OF THE FUR HE WOULDN'T SNEEZE
AND <unk> AND THAT YOU WOULD HAVE A BETTER MARRIAGE
SIL
<unk> SO IT REALLY WAS MY FATHER'S DAY GIFT TO HIM
I COULDN'T BUY HIM ANY ANYTHING NICE SINCE YOU TOOK AWAY M MY ALLOWANCE FOR SHAVING THE NEIGHBOR'S DOG
HOW COME JENNY GETS A CAT AND I GET A STUPID TURTLE ANYWAY
TURTLES DON'T HAVE DO ANYTHING EXCEPT POKE THEIR HEADS OUT AND NOT BE CUDDLY
CAN I GET A DOG PLEASE
SO IN MY CONCLUSION
I'M GETTING HUNGRY AND I'M SORRY FOR SHAVING THE CAT ALTHOUGH YOU CAN SEE THAT IT'S REALLY JENNY'S FAULT FOR NOT BEING THE RESPONSIBLE AS YOU ALWAYS SAY AND NOT BRUSHING HER TEETH
PS IF YOU WOULD HAVE BROUGHT BROUGHT HER BOUGHT HER A TURTLE I COULDN'T HAVE SHAVED IT
SINCERELY DANNY
SIL
<unk> THE STORY WAS ABOUT THIS GUY NAMED DANNY AND HE SHAVED HI HIS SISTERS CAT
AND HE IN THE IN THE LETTER TO HIS PARENTS HE WAS SAYING ALL THESE REASONS BUT I DON'T THINK THEY WERE REALLY TRUE I THINK HE JUST DID IT FOR FUN
<unk> AND IT DO AND HE JUST KEPT NAMING THE REASONS
AND SO THAT HE WOULD GET IN TROUBLE
SIL
AND THAT'S WHAT I THINK
SIL
UH SOME OF THE EXCUSES WERE HE <unk> WANTED DIDN'T WANT HER MOM TO SNEEZE ANYMORE BECAUSE OF THE CAT FUR AND THAT THE CAT ALWAYS FLIPPED OVER THE TURTLES SHELL
AND HIS SISTER WASN'T RESPONSIBLE TO HAVE ONE SO IF SHE DIDN'T HAVE ONE SHE HE WOULDN'T HAVE SHAVED IT AND
<unk> THAT HE WAS JUST TRYING TO GET OUT OF IT SO THAT'S SOME OF IT

NOW ALL THE PEOPLE REJOICED BECAUSE THE WICKED KING SHOULD RULE THEM NO LONGER
SIL
<unk> ROOSTER JOHN
BEFORE I TELL YOU ABOUT H HOW ROOSTER JOHN GOT HIS NAME YOU SHOULD KNOW A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE TOWN OF FRANKSVILLE
FRANKSVILLE IS A TOWN THAT SEEMED TO HAVE ONE PROBLEM AFTER THE OTHER
THEIR PROBLEMS STARTED WHEN THEY RAN OUT OF WATER
THANKFULLY SOMEONE WAS DIGGING A HOLE AND FOUND WATER
BUT SOON AFTER THEY
SIL
AFTER THAT S THEY STARTED TO GET FLIES
THEY GOT TONS AND TONS OF FLIES
SIL
THE FLIES STOPPED JUST A BIT AND THEN A MAN MOVED INTO TOWN WHO PLAYED A F WHO PLAYED THE FLUTE SO BADLY THAT PEOPLE WOULD RUN AWAY SCREAMING
<br> MAYBE <unk> A POORLY <unk> MAYBE A POORLY PLAYED FLUTE DOESN'T SOUND ALL THAT BAD
<br> BUT JUST TRY TO IMAGINE SOMEONE SCRATCHING A CHALKBOARD WITH A FORK AND THEN MULTIPLY THAT TIMES A HUNDRED
THAT'S HOW THE FLUTE SOUNDED WHEN THE GUY PLAYED IT I'M SERIOUS
STILL THAT'S NOT THAT'S NOT AS BAD AS MILLION FLIES OF FLIES MILLIONS OF FLIES I SUPPOSE
THE BAD THE BAD FLUTE PLAYER WAS ROOSTER JOHN
HE WASN'T CALLED ROOSTER JOHN YET BUT THAT CAME LATER
HE WAS THE NEW TOWN DENTIST
HE WAS AN EXCELLENT DENTIST BUT HIS REAL LOVE WAS MUSIC
HE PLAYED MANY MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS SUCH AS THE GUITAR THE TUBA THE PIANO AND THE CLARINET
HOWEVER FOR SOME REASON THE WAY HIS MOUTH WAS SHAPED THE M MADE HIS FLUTE SOUND AWFUL
SIL
<br> WE CAN'T LET YOU PLAY THE FLUTE ANYMORE JOHN SAID POLICE CHIEF SANDERS
THE NEIGHBORS ARE COMPLAINING AND THE CATS AND DOGS ARE TRYING TO CHEW OFF THEIR EARS
<br> BUT I HAVE TO PLAY I WAS BORN TO DO IT I DON'T KNOW WHY BUT I FEEL LIKE I HAVE TO OR ELSE BAD THINGS WILL HAPPEN
LOOK JOHN I'VE HEARD YOU PLAY THE CLARINET YOU'RE QUITE GOOD WHY DON'T YOU PLAY THAT INSTEAD SAID CHIEF SANDERS
SIL
OH THAT'S A THAT'S A NICE INSTRUMENT BUT IT'S NOT THE FLUTE I EVEN WROTE YOU A SONG CHIEF SANDERS IT'S CALLED COPS AND ROBBERS
HE PLAYED THE SONG THE POLICE CHIEF HATED THE SOUND SO MUCH THAT HE THREW JOHN IN JAIL
<unk> BUT THEY COULDN'T KEEP JOHN IN JAIL SINCE HE REALLY SINCE HE WASN'T REALLY BREAKING ANY LAWS
THERE WAS NOTHING THE POLICE COULD DO
BESIDES EVERYBODY LOVED JOHN
SINCE HE HAD BECOME THE TOWN DENTIST EVERYONE'S TEETH WERE MUCH WHITER AND CLEANER NO ONE HAD ANY CAVITIES
SO THERE WAS NO PROBLEM IN A LITTLE IN THE LITTLE TOWN OF FRANKSVILLE
WHAT SHOULD THEY DO THEY COULDN'T KEEP JOHN IN JAIL AND THEY DIDN'T WANT TO TO KICK HIM OUT OF TOWN BECAUSE THEY ALL HAD SUCH NICE T NICE TEETH
SO THEY DECIDED THAT JOHN COULD PLAY THE FLUTE AND EVERYBODY ELSE WOULD HAVE TO WEAR EARPLUGS
SINCE I'M SURE YOU GUESSED THAT DIDN'T WORK
SIL
NO ONE COULD HEAR ANYTHING PEOPLE WERE GETTING INTO CAR ACCIDENTS
SIL
<unk> AND EVERYBODY LOOKED REALLY SILLY AT DANCES DANCING TO MUSIC THEY COULDN'T HEAR
THEY R THEY COULDN'T THEY COULDN'T THEY JUST COULDN'T LEAD A NORMAL LIFE
AND THEY DECIDED TO LOWER HIM DOWN A WELL AND LET HIM PLAY THERE <unk> WHERE NO ONE DOWN THERE WHERE NO ONE C DOWN WHERE NO ONE COULD HEAR HIM
JOHN THOUGHT THAT IT WAS AN OK IDEA BUT THERE WAS AN ECHO IN THE WELL THAT MADE THE FLUTE SOUND LOUDER
WINDOWS WERE BREAKING AND ALL THE COWS IN TOWN STARTED TO MAKE SOUR MILK
THE LOCAL DENTIST DOCTOR SCIENTIST DOCTOR WONG CAME UP WITH AN IDEA
HE THOUGHT THAT IF UHM
<unk>
HE THOUGHT THAT IF HE MADE A NEW MOUTHPIECE ESPECIALLY SHAPED FOR JOHN'S MOUTH THEN PERHAPS HE COULD PLAY THE FLUTE NORMALLY
AND GUESS WHAT WHAT IT WORKED
DOCTOR WONG WAS THE TOWN HERO THE FLUTE SOUNDED NORMAL AND TURNED OUT JOHN COULD PLAY IT QUITE WELL
<unk> THE PEOPLE IN THE TOWN DECIDED TO HAVE A GREAT BIG PARADE IN FRANKSVILLE TO CELEBRATE THE FACT FOR ONCE THAT THERE WAS NO WATER PROBLEM NO FLY PROBLEM AND NO FLUTE PROBLEM
DOCTOR WONG AND JOHN WERE THE STARS OF THE PARADE
THEY EVEN W WERE UP ON THE MAIN FLOAT
A BIG BAND PLAYED AS THEY MARCHED UP AND DOWN MAIN STREET EVERYONE CHEERED
<unk> THEN SUDDENLY A FLY LANDED ON THE LITTLE GIRL THEN THE FLY LANDED ON SOMEONE ELSE THEN SOME LANDED ON A BUNCH OF PEOPLE
PRETTY SOON TONS OF FLIES WERE LANDING ON EVERYONE
BUT BEFORE THEY KNEW IT <unk> THE TOWN WAS FILLED WITH FLIES AGAIN
OH NO SAID CHIEF SANDERS WHEN THINGS WERE JUST GOING GOOD FOR FRANKSVILLE
JOHN DIDN'T KNOW WHAT WHAT JUST KEPT TO DO SO HE JUST KEPT ON PLAYING HIS FLUTE
THE FLIES WERE ANNOYING SO HE WOULD SWAT AT THEM WITH HIS HAND OR EVEN HIS NEW FLUTE
HE STARTED SHAKING THE FLUTE TO GET THE FLIES OFF AND ACCIDENTALLY S SMASHED IT INTO PIECES
HE WAS VERY UPSET AT FIRST THEN HE SAID OH WELL GOOD THING I BROUGHT MY OLD FLUTE AS A BACK UP
NO NO PLEASE DON'T PLAY YOUR OLD FLUTE BEGGED DOCTOR WONG BUT IT WAS TOO LATE
JOHN HAD STARTED PLAYING
WHEN THE TOWNSFOLK HEARD THE NOISE THEY COULDN'T EVEN SWAT THE FLIES ANYMORE
THEY HAD TO COVER THEIR EARS FROM THE HORRIBLE SOUND
THE FLIES WOULD LAND ALL OVER THE PEOPLE AND THEY COULDN'T SWAT THEM OFF
IT WAS GROSS THEN SUDDENLY THE FLIES FLEW AWAY FAST AS THEY COULD
SIL
DOCTOR WONG THOUGHT F THOUGHT FOR A SECOND AND THEN PRONOUNCED
IT'S THE FLUTE SOUND THE FLIES HATE JOHN'S FLUTE PLAYING AND AS MUCH AS WE DO
JOHN THE DENTIST IS DRIVING THE FLIES AWAY
THEN IT WAS THE THEN THE PEOPLE OF FRANKSVILLE REALIZED THAT THEY WOULD HAVE TO TAKE THE GOOD WITH THE BAD
<br> FROM THEN ON JOHN WOULD WAKE UP AT SUNRISE JUST LIKE A ROOSTER TO PLAY TO PLAY TO KEEP THE FLIES AWAY
SIL
ROOSTER JOHN IS A STORY ABOUT A TOWN THAT GETS INTO PROBLEM AFTER PROBLEM AND THEY GET A BIG FLY PROBLEM AND JOHN UH ROOSTER JOHN STARTS UHM HE PLAYS THE FLUTE AND UHM ALL THE FLIES GO AWAY
AND S AND IF H HE HAS HIS AND THEN SOMEONE INVENTS HIM ANOTHER FLUTE THAT DOESN'T MAKE A HORRIBLE SOUND LIKE HIS OTHER FLUTE DID CAUSE HIS OTHER FLUTE MADE A REALLY HORRIBLE SOUND THAT THE TOWNSPEOPLE COULDN'T LIKE STAND
AND SO BUT THE GOOD SOUND OF THE FLUTE LIKE MADE THE FLIES ALL COME BACK AND SO HE THE TOWN JUST HAD TO LIVE WITH LIKE WHAT ROOSTER JOHN PLAYED AND SO
HE WOULD LIKE WAKE UP EVERY MORNING AND LIKE PLAY HIS FLUTE UHM LIKE A ROOSTER UHM WOULD LIKE CROW AT THE BEGINNING OF THE DAY

THE FIRST TIME I EVER TOOK AN AIRPLANE BY MYSELF WAS FUN AND SCARY
I DIDN'T KNOW ANYONE ALL THE ALL THAT HAD TO GO THE WAY FROM NEW YORK TO TEXAS WITHOUT MY PARENTS I WAS FLYING THERE TO SEE MY GRANDFATHER AND WE WERE GOING TO GO FISHING
I'VE ALWAYS THOUGHT FLYING WAS FUN YOU GO H YOU YOU GO HIGHER THAN ANY MOUNTAIN GO FASTER THAN ANY CAR
SIL
BUT TO TELL THE TRUTH WITHOUT MY PARENTS THERE I WAS PRETTY NERVOUS I GUESS IT WAS BECAUSE THE PLANE WAS SO LOUD AND I DIDN'T KNOW ANYONE
I STARTED THINKING THAT WE MIGHT CRASH I DIDN'T LIKE TO THINK ABOUT THAT BUT I COULDN'T HELP IT
THAT'S WHEN I MISSED MY PARENTS THE MOST BUT ONCE A PLANE WAS IN THE AIR I FELT PRETTY GOOD
IT WAS PRETTY GOOD MY MOM GAVE ME A COLORING BOOK OF COOL LOOKING DRAGONS TO KEEP ME BUSY I COLORED THE DRAGON PICTURES ALL GREEN SO IT DIDN'T TAKE VERY LONG
SIL
I ONLY USED THE GREEN CRAYON BECAUSE IT WAS THE TALLEST AND I WANTED TO CATCH UP WITH THE RED BROWN BLUE YELLOW PURPLE AND BLACK ONES
SIL
ONE NIGHT THE PAPER CLIP FELL OFF
SIL
IT'S RIGHT HERE
SIL
ONE THING ABOUT BEING BY YOURSELF ON AIRPLANES IS THAT THE FLIGHT ATTENDANTS ARE VERY NICE TO YOU
I HAD SEVEN COLA'S AND FOUR GINGER ALE'S WHICH MADE ME HAD TO GO TO THE BATHROOM EIGHT TIMES
I I WAS GLAD THAT THERE WASN'T ANYONE NEXT TO ME THE PERSON NEXT TO ME WOULD HAVE WOULD HAVE BEEN BEEN VERY ANNOYED
EVENTUALLY THE FLIGHT ATTENDANT SEEMED TO GET A LITTLE ANNOYED THAT I HAD TO GO TO THE BATHROOM SO MUCH
BUT IT WAS HER FAULT SHE WAS THE ONE THAT KEPT TRYING TO GIVE ME PEANUTS
SIL
I TOLD HER THAT I WANTED A BANANA SPLIT INSTEAD BUT SHE SAID THERE THEY HAVE THEY DON'T HAVE ANY BANANA SPLITS ON THIS PLANE
SIL
IN THE FIRST PLACE AND THAT IF SHE WOULD GIVE ME A BANANA SPLIT I WOULDN'T HAVE TO GO THE BATHROOM SO MUCH
SHE TOLD ME TO BE QUIET AND WATCH THE MOVIE I TRIED TO WATCH THE MOVIE BUT I HAD ALREADY SEEN IT SEEN THAT SO IT WAS BORING THE FLIGHT ATTENDANT GAVE ME A DECK OF CARDS BUT SHE WOULDN'T PLAY GO FISH WITH ME SHE SAID
SIL
SHE HAD TO HELP OTHER PASSENGERS
SIL
I HAD MY GAMEBOY IN MY BACK I HAD A GAME BOY IN MY BACKPACK MY BACKPACK WAS O IN THE OVERHEAD THINGY I TRIED TO PUSH THE BOTTOM LIGHTS OVER SO THE FLIGHT ATTENDANT WOULD COME WOULD
<br>
LIGHTS OVER SO MY FLIGHT ATTENDANT WOULD COME BUT GUESS WHAT SHE WAS SHE WAS TOO SHORT TO REACH THE BOTTOM
SO I STARTED YELLING HEY PEANUT LADY PEANUT LADY SHE DIDN'T LIKE ME CALLING HER PEANUT LADY BUT SHE DID GET M ME MY GAME BOY
SHE TOLD ME TO CALL HER JENNIFER INSTEAD
SIL
I PLAYED ON MY GAME BOY UNTIL I GOT THE NEW HIGH SCORE THEN JENNIFER CAME UP TO ME AND SAID

THE WAY I FIGURED OUT MY GAME MY GAME BOY WAS ONLY FIVE BUTTONS AND I CAN'T GET PAST THE TH THE PAST THE L I CAN'T GET PAST LEVEL THREE IMAGINE HOW HARD IT'D BE TO WORK ALL THOSE MILLIONS OF BUTTONS AND EAT PEANUTS
THE PILOT TOLD ME THAT THERE WASN'T

SIL
HOW STRANGE THAT I LIVE THAT A LIVE ANIMAL SHOULD GROW ON A STALK LIKE A FLOWER
I GUESS I'LL BUY A FEW SNAKES SINCE THEY LOOK SO FUNNY COILING OUT
SIL
DEAR MOM AND DAD PARENTS
SINCE YOU HAVE GROUNDED ME AND TOLD ME TO WRITE DOWN WHY I'M I AM SORRY BEFORE I WAS ALLOWED OUT OF MY ROOM I AM MAD AT YOU
I WOULD LIKE TO START BY SAYING THAT I THINK YOU ARE VERY MEAN TO MAKE ME DO THIS BECAUSE IT WASN'T EVEN MY FAULT I COULDN'T HELP IT ANYWAY IT WAS AN ACCIDENT AND I DIDN'T EVEN DO IT ON PURPOSE
I REALLY DIDN'T MEAN TO SHAVE THAT CAT SHAVE THE CAT REALLY I SWEAR OK HERE'S WHAT HAPPENED AS I REMEMBER IT
I SAW THE CAT WAS TRYING I SAW THAT THE CAT WAS TRYING TO GET THE GERBILS SO YOU AND YOU TOLD US WE COULDN'T HIT THE ANIMALS SO I WOULDN'T DIDN'T KNOW WHAT ELSE TO DO
SO I GRABBED DAD GRABBED DAD'S NOSE HAIRS CLIPPERS AND SHAVED IT
YOU YOU YOU SHOULD BE PROUD OF ME FOR THINKING SOMETIMES WHY WE SHOULDN'T ALWAYS THINK THAT ALL THAT THAT THAT THINK ALL THAT GREAT UNDER PRESSURE
AND DO YOU KNOW WHAT THOSE STUPID GERBILS DIDN'T EVEN THANK ME THEY JUST RAN ON THAT STUPID WHEEL AND DID STUPID THINGS THAT'S THAT'S THE LAST TIME I SHAVE THE CAT TO PROTECT MY ANY STUPID GERBILS
BESIDES THE REAL REASON I I SHAVED THE CAT WAS TO KEEP IT NICE AND COOL I DIDN'T WANT THE T TO SEE THE CAT GETTING ALL HOT AND UNCOMFORTABLE AND STUFF
YOU GUYS WILL PROBABLY JUST SAY IT'S WINTER DANNY CATS DON'T OVERHEAT IN THE WINTER
A AND SO WHAT IF IT'S WINTER BUT <unk> I MEAN I MEAN IT'LL BE SUMMER SOON ENOUGH SOON ENOUGH AND I'LL AND I JUST WANTED THE CAT TO GET USED TO THE IDEA BEFORE IT GOT REALLY HOT PLUS OSCAR MY TURTLE TOLD ME TO SHAVE THE CAT
FINE OSCAR CAN'T REALLY TALK BUT IF HE COULD HE WOULD HAVE SAID PLEASE SHAVE THE CAT IT KEEPS HITTING ME ON THE SHELL AND TRYING TO ROLL ME OVER WHEN YOU LEAVE ME IN WHEN YOU LEAVE THE ROOM YOU GUYS NEVER LIKED OSCAR AS MUCH AS THE CAT ANYWAY
YOU WOULDN'T YOU WOULDN'T ALWAYS TAKE THE CAT CAT'S SIDE IF YOU KNEW THE STUFF HE DID TO MY POOR TURTLE CAT'S AREN'T ALWAYS NICE IT JUST JUST LIKE MY SISTER JENNY ISN'T ALWAYS NICE
THE REALEST REASON I SHAVED THE CAT WAS TO MAKE A BIG WING A WING FOR THE THOSE POOR HAIR LESS CATS THAT WE SAW ON TV ON THE ANIMAL CHANNEL
I I KNEW OUR CAT WOULD GROW HER FUR BACK BUT SOME CATS DON'T HAVE HAIR THEY'RE CALLED HAIRLESS CATS THEY NEED FUR IN THE WINTER SOMETIMES I THINK
I SWEAR THAT'S THE REASON ALSO I WAS G GOING TO SELL THE CAT THE CAT FUR AND BUY MY SISTER JENNY BRACES FOR HER F BIG STUPID FACE
PLUS I FORGOT TO TELL YOU THAT YOU SHOULD BE BLAMING MRS CASPER MY SCIENCE TEACHER SHE MADE US SHAVE SOMETHING FOR SCIENCE ASK HER SHE SAID THAT WHEN WE SHAVE HAIR IT GROWS BACK HARDER AND SOMETIMES EVEN DARKER
SO I THOUGHT IF I WOULD SH SHOULD COULD SHAVE THE CAT A LOT A LOT A BUNCH OF TIMES HER HAIR WOULD GROW BACK HARDER EACH TIME AND SHE WOULD SOON SHE WOULD BE AN INVINCIBLE COAT OF CAT FUR ARMOR
THEN SHE WOULD BE A SUPER CAT AND YOU COULD TELL AND YOU COULD TAKE HER ON TV SHOWS AND GET LOTS OF MONEY SO THAT YOU CAN SEND JENNY HER CAT BECAUSE SHE'S SO RESPONSIBLE AND STUFF
JUST CAUSE SHE'S A GOOD STUDENT DOESN'T MEAN SHE'S REALLY RESPONSIBLE
J LAST NIGHT I SAW SHE DIDN'T EVEN BRUSH HER TEETH OH YEAH I FORGOT TO TELL YOU THAT
DEAR MOM AND DAD JENNY DIDN'T BRUSH HER TEETH LAST NIGHT
I THINK SH THAT SHE SHOULD BRUSH HER TEETH TWICE TONIGHT THAT'S MY OPINION THOUGH I TH I BET YOU DIDN'T KNOW SOMETHING ELSE DID DID YOU KNOW THAT I WANTED TO BE A BARBER
I WAS AFRAID TO TELL YOU THE REAL THE REAL REASON I SHAVED THE CAT WAS THAT I WANT TO BE A BARBER AND I NEEDED PRACTICE
IT WAS AF I WAS AFRAID YOU WOULDN'T LET ME PRACTICE ON MY OWN HEAD CAN I PRACTICE SHA BY SHAVING JENNY'S HEAD
I PROMISE I'LL THAT I'LL DO A BETTER JOB THEN I DID ON THE CAT BECAUSE NOW I HA NOW I HAVE WHAT DAD CALLS LIFE EXPERIENCE THAT'S NOT THAT'S N THAT'S NOT I SHAVED THE CAT THOUGH
ACTUALLY THE TRUTH IS THAT I BY ACCIDENT TURNED ON THE NOSE HAIR CLIPPERS AND THE CAT WAS BEING CHASED BY THE TURTLE AND RAN RIGHT BY THE CLIPPERS AND SHAVED HERSELF
I KEPT SAYING NO KITTY DON'T NO DON'T SHAVE YOURSELF BUT THE ST MY STUPID SISTER NEVER TAUGHT HER CAT HOW TO LISTEN SO SHE JUST IGNORED ME
SEE SHE'S NOT RESPONSIBLE AFTER ALL IF I HAD A CAT I WOULD TEACH IT TO TO NOT TO NOT SHAVE ITSELF THAT'S FOR SURE
I I KNOW I I DID I DON'T HAVE TO GET GOOD GRADES TO KNOW WHAT YOU SHOULD TEACH A CAT TO SHAVE ITSELF
PLUS IF YOU WEREN'T ALWAYS CUDDLING WITH MY SISTER SO MUCH MAYBE SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN WITH HER CAT INSTEAD THE CAT CAME INTO MY ROOM BECAUSE JENNY NEVER PLAYS WITH IT ENOUGH
THE CAT LIKED BEING SHAVED ANYWAY SO I DON'T SEE THE BIG DEAL I I THINK IT REALLY LIKES ITS HAIRCUT THE ONLY REASON IT HASN'T COME OUT FOR TWO WEEKS IS BECAUSE YOU GUYS MADE SUCH A BIG DEAL ABOUT IT
POOR KITTY THIS IS THIS AND POOR KITTY THAT IT'S YOUR FAULT REALLY DAD PLEASE DON'T READ THE NEXT PART
DEAR MOM DON'T LET DAD KNOW THE REAL REASON I SHAVED THE CAT HE'S ALWAYS SNEEZING AROUND IT
I KNOW HOW MUCH YOU HATE HIM ALWAYS SNEEZING AND STUFF SO I THOUGHT IF I GET RID OF ITS FUR HE WOULDN'T SNEEZE AND THAT YOU WOULD HAVE A BETTER MARRIAGE SO THAT'S REALLY WHY MY FATHER'S DAY GIFT TO HIM
I COULDN'T I COULDN'T BUY HIM ANYTHING NICE SINCE YOU TOOK AWAY MY ALLOWANCE FOR WHEN I SHAVED THE NEIGHBOR'S DOG
HOW COME JENNY GETS A CAT AND I GET A STUPID TURTLE ANYWAY TURTLES DON'T DO ANYTHING EXCEPT FOR POKE THEIR HEADS OUT AND NOT BE CUDDLY
CAN I GET A DOG PLEASE SO IN CONCLUSION I'M GETTING HUNGRY AND I'M SORRY FOR SHAVING THE CAT ALTHOUGH YOU CAN SEE THAT IT'S REALLY JENNY'S FAULT FOR NOT BEING RESPONSIBLE AS YOU CAN SAY AS YOU CAN ALWAYS SAY AND NOT BRUSHING HER TEETH
PS IF YOU REALLY IF YOU COULD HAVE BOUGHT HER A TURTLE I WOULDN'T SHAVED IT SIN SINCERELY DANNY
IT'S ABOUT A PERSON TELL APOLOGIZING TO HIS MOM AND DAD BECAUSE HE SHAVED THE CAT AND HE REALLY TRIED TO MAKE
HE REALLY WANTED THE DAD TO NOT BE ALLERGIC TO THE CAT BECAUSE THAT'S HIS FATHER'S DAY GIFT
SIL
<br>
UHM WELL THIS LETTER IS ABOUT
A KID TRYING TO MAKE UP EXCUSES BY SAYING THAT LIKE THE CAT SHAVED ITSELF AND HE GOT A STUPID TURTLE AND HE WANTED THE CAT TO FEEL NICER BECAUSE IT HE WANTED IT TO BE COOL AND NOT BE HOT ALL THE TIME
AND AND THEN HE ACTUALLY TOLD HIS MOM THAT HIS DAD WAS LIKE ALLERGIC TO CATS
AND HE WANTED HIM TO FEEL BETTER BECAUSE HE DIDN'T WANT HIM SNEEZING ALL THE TIME
AND IT THAT WAS HIS FATHER'S DAY GIFT TO HIM CAUSE HE HIS ALLOWANCE WAS TOOK TOOKEN AWAY

SIL
ANOTHER WAY TO SAY THAT THERE WERE ARE TWELVE DONUTS IS TO SAY THAT THERE ARE A DOZEN
ROOSTER JOHN
SIL
BEFORE I TELL YOU HOW ROOSTER JOHN GOT HIS NAME YOU SHOULD KNOW A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE TOWN OF FRANKSVILLE
F FRANKSVILLE IS WAS A TOWN THAT SEEMED TO HAVE ONE PROBLEM AFTER ANOTHER
SIL
THEIR PROBLEMS STARTED WHEN THEY RAN OUT OF WATER THANKFULLY SOMEONE WAS DIGGING A HOLE AND FOUND WATER
BUT SOON AFTER THEY STARTED TO GET FLEAS THEY GOT TONS AND TONS OF FLEAS FLIES AND
SIL
THEN THE FLIES STOPPED <unk>
BUT JUST THEN A MA A MAN MOVED IN TOWN WHO PLAYED THE FLUTE SO BADLY THAT PEOPLE WOULD RUN AWAY SCREAMING
SIL
MAYBE A POORLY PLAYED FLUTE DOESN'T SOUND THAT BAD BUT JUST TRY TO IMAGINE SOME SCRATCHING SOMEONE SCRATCHING ON A CHALKBOARD WITH A FORK
SIL
AND THEN MULTIPLY THAT TIMES BY THAT TIMES A HUNDRED THAT'S HOW THE FLUTE SOUNDED WHEN THIS GUY PLAYED IT I'M SERIOUS
SIL
STILL IT'S NOT AS BAD AS MILLIONS OF F FLIES I SUPPOSE
THE BAD FLUTE PLAYER WAS ROOSTER JOHN
SIL
HE WASN'T CALLED ROOSTER JOHN HE WASN'T CALLED ROOSTER JOHN YET THAT CAME LATER
SIL
HE WAS
SIL
THE NEW TOWN DENTIST
SIL
HE WAS AN EXCELLENT DENTIST
SIL
BUT HIS REAL LOVE WAS MUSIC
HE PLAYED MANY MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS SUCH AS THE GUITAR THE TUBA THE PIANO AND THE CLARINET HOWEVER FOR SOME REASONS THE WAY HIS MOUTH WAS SHAPED MADE HIS FLUTE SOUND AWFUL
SIL
WE CAN'T LET YOU PLAY THE FLUTE ANYMORE JOHN SAID THE POLICE CHIEF SAID POLICE CHIEF S SANDERS THE NEIGHBORS ARE COMPLAINING THAT THE CATS AND DOGS ARE TRYING TO CHEW OFF THEIR EARS
SIL
BUT I HAVE I HAVE TO PLAY I WAS BORN TO DO IT I DON'T KNOW WHY BUT I FEEL LIKE I HAVE TO OR ELSE BAD THINGS WILL HAPPEN
LOOK JOHN
SIL
I'VE HEARD YOU PLAY THE CLARINET YOU'RE QUITE GOOD WHY DON'T YOU PLAY THAT INSTEAD CH SAID CHIEF SANDERS
SIL
OH THAT'S A NICE INSTRUMENT BUT IT'S JUST NOT THE FLUTE
SIL
I EVEN WROTE A SONG CHIEF SANDERS IT'S CALLED COPS AND ROBBERS
SIL
THEN HE PLAYED THE SONG THE POLICE CHIEF HATED THE SOUND SO MUCH HE THREW JOHN IN JAIL
SIL
BUT THEY COULDN'T KEEP JOHN IN JAIL SINCE HE WASN'T WASN'T REALLY BREAKING ANY LAWS SO THERE WAS NOTHING THE POLICE COULD DO
BESIDES EVERYBODY LOVED JOHN SINCE HE HAD BECOME THE TOWN DENTIST EVERYBODY'S TEETH SO WERE MUCH WHITER AND
SIL
CL CLEANER AND NO ONE HAD ANY CAVITIES
SIL
SO THERE WAS A PROBLEM
SIL
IN THE LITTLE TOWN OF FRANKSVILLE WHAT SHOULD THEY DO THEY COULDN'T KEEP JOHN IN JAIL AND THEY DIDN'T WANT TO KICK HIM OUT OF THE TOWN BECAUSE ALL
SIL
CAUSE THEY ALL HAD SUCH NICE TEETH SO THEY DECIDED THAT JOHN COULD PLAY THE FLUTE AND EVERYBODY ELSE WOULD WEAR WOULD HAVE TO WEAR EARPLUGS
WELL I'M SURE YOU GUESSED THAT DIDN'T WORK NO ONE COULD HEAR ANYTHING PEOPLE WERE GETTING INTO CAR ACCIDENTS AND
SIL
OH NO SAID
SIL
AND EVERYBODY LOOKED REALLY SILLY AT DANCES
SIL
DANCING TO MUSIC THEY COULDN'T HEAR
SIL
THEY JUST COULDN'T LEAD A NORMAL LIFE
SIL
THEN THEY DECIDED TO LOWER HIM DOWN
SIL
AS WE
SIL
A WELL AND LET HIM PLAY DOWN WHERE NO ONE COULD HEAR HIM
JOHN THOUGHT IT WAS AN OK IDEA
BUT THERE WAS AN ECHO IN THE WELL THAT MADE THE FLUTE SOUND LOUDER
SIL
WINDOWS WERE BREAKING AND ALL THE COWS IN THE TOWN STARTED TO MAKE SOUR MILK
SIL
THE LOCAL SCIENTIST DOC DOCTOR WONG CAME UP WITH AN IDEA HE THOUGHT THAT IF HE MADE A NEW MOUTHPIECE ESPECIALLY SHAPED FOR JOHN'S MOUTH THEN PERHAPS HE COULD PLAY THE FLUTE NORMALLY
SIL
AND GUESS WHAT
SIL
IT WORKED DOCTOR JOHN WAS A TOWN HERO DOCTOR WONG WAS THE TOWN HERO
THE FLUTE SOUNDED NORMAL AND IT TURNED OUT JOHN COULD PLAY QUITE WELL
THE PEOPLE IN THE TOWN DECIDED TO HAVE A GREAT BIG PARADE IN FRANKSVILLE TO CELEBRATE THE FACT
SIL
THAT FOR ONCE THERE WAS NO WATER PROBLEM NO FLY PROBLEM AND NO FLUTE PROBLEM DOCTOR WONG AND JOHN WERE STAR WERE THE STARS OF THE PARADE
SIL
THEY WERE UP ON THE MAIN FLOAT THE BIG BAND PLAYED AS THEY MARCHED DOWN THE S D UP AND DOWN MAIN STREET
EVERYONE CHEERED
SIL
THEN SUDDENLY A FLY LANDED ON A LITTLE GIRL THEN THE FLY LANDED ON SOMEONE ELSE
THEN SOME SOME LANDED ON A BUNCH OF PEOPLE PRETTY SOON THERE WERE TONS OF FLIES
SIL
TONS OF FLIES WERE LANDING ON EVERYONE BEFORE THEY KNEW IT THE TOWN WAS FILLED WITH FLIES AGAIN
SIL
OH NO SAID CHIEF SANDERS JUST WHEN THINGS WERE GOING GOOD IN FRANKSVILLE
SIL
JOHN DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO SO HE KEPT PLAYING HIS FLUTE THE FLIES WERE ANNOYING SO HE WOULDN'T SO HE WOULD SWAT AT THEM WITH HIS HANDS
SIL
OR EVEN HIS NEW FLUTE HE STARTED SHAKING THE FLUTE TO GET THE FLIES OFF THE
SIL
AND ACCIDENTALLY SMASHED IT INTO PIECES
SIL
IT WAS VERY UPSET HE WAS VERY UPSET AT FIRST THEN HE SAID OH WELL GOOD THING I BROUGHT MY OLD FLUTE AS BACK UP
NO NO PLEASE DON'T PLAY YOUR OLD FLUTE BIG BEGGED DOCTOR WONG BUT IT WAS TOO LATE JOHN HAD STARTED PLAYING
WHEN THE TOWNSFOLK HEARD THE NOISE THEY COULDN'T EVEN SWAT AT THE FLIES ANYMORE
SIL
THEY HAD TO COVER THEIR EARS FROM THE HORRIBLE SOUND THE FLIES WOULD LAND ALL OVER THE PEOPLE AND THEY COULDN'T SWAT THEM OFF IT WAS GROSS THEN SUDDENLY THE FLIES FLEW AWAY FAST AS THEY COULD
SIL
DOCTOR WONG THOUGHT FOR FOR A SECOND THEN PRONOUNCED
SIL
IT'S THE FLUTE SOUND THE FLIES HATE JOHN'S FLUTE PLAYING AS MUCH AS WE DO JOHN THE DENTIST DRIVES AWAY
SIL
THE FLIES AWAY
IT WAS
SIL
THEN THAT THE PEOPLE OF FRANKSVILLE VILLE REALIZED THAT THEY WOULD HAVE TO TAKE A GOOD
SIL
TAKE THE GOOD WITH THE BAD BECAUSE AS BAD AS THE SOU AS
SIL
BAD AS THE FLUTE SOUNDED IT WAS A LOT BETTER THAN THOUSANDS OF FLIES CRAWLING ON THEM
SIL
FROM THEN ON JOHN WOULD WAKE UP AT SUNRISE LIKE A ROOSTER AND PLAY TO KEEP THE FLIES AWAY
WELL IT WAS ABOUT THIS GUY WHO COULDN'T PLAY THE FLUTE VERY WELL BUT HE WAS A REALLY GOOD DENTIST
SO
SIL
HE SO HE PLAYED THE FLUTE TO KEEP THE FLIES AWAY FROM THE LITTLE TOWN FRANKSVILLE
SIL

AYE I KNOW SAID THE DAME GENTLY FEARING TO INTERRUPT THE STORY
YOU CERTAINLY ARE AN ABLE MINDED YOUNGSTER HIRAM HE OBSERVED
AFTER DINNER JORDAN CREPT UP BY WAY OF THE BACK STAIRS TO SEE HER
THEY THEN JOURNEYED ONWARDS TILL THEY ALMOST REACHED THE MOUNTAINS
THE S THY SWORD CANNOT STAND AGAINST AN OAKEN STAFF SUCH AS MINE
FOR YOU NEVER KNEW EXACTLY WHAT THIS MAN MIGHT SAY OR DO
DON'T MAKE ANY OF YOUR ABRUPT REMARKS OR DO ANYTHING ODD WILL YOU
AND STILL SHE SAT AND STILL SHE REELED AND STILL SHE WISHED FOR COMPANY
HE TILTED HIS HAT BRIM TO SHADE HIS FACE AND LOOKED FOR THE CHI FOR HIS CHICKENS

TOM'S COSTUME WAS A SPLENDID IMITATION OF A COWBOY
YOUR LORDSHIP IS GREATLY TO BE CONGRATULATED HE SAID WARMLY

IT WAS THAT DAY WHEN YOU GOT YOUR TOE POUNDED ADDED DAVIE LOOKING AT JOEL
NAN RECEIVED A SEWING MACHINE TO REMIND HER OF THE FRESH AIR WORK
WE ALL LOOKED AT EACH OTHER TRYING TO GLEAM SOMETHING E EACH OTHER FROM TH THE OTHER
DIANA SHOOK HER HEAD GLEEFULLY HER BLACK EYES DANCING WITH MERRIMENT
THEN SHE PULLED THE HOOD OF HIS CLOAK OVER HIS EARS AND OVER HIS BROW
WHICH OF YOU BOYS PLACED THIS STONE SIGNAL ASKED THE YOUNG EXPLORER
THEY SHOOK THE FLOUR OFF HER AND SET HER DOWN ON THE KITCHEN FLOOR
I BEG YOUR PARDON SAID THE LEARNED MAN IT IS AN OLD HABIT WITH ME
SHE SAW THAT SHE WAS GOING ON THE GRASS AND HAD BROKEN AND HAD AND THE BROKEN WHEEL BESIDE HER
SIL
THE PANDA
WHY DID A PANDA WITH THE BEAUTIFUL GIRL NAME YIN YIN HAVE HER NAME CHANGED TO THE VERY UN BEAUTIFUL GIRL NAME COLUMBUS
IT WAS FRED'S IDEA SO LET'S BEGIN WITH FRED FRED FED THE PANDA BEARS THE TIGERS AND TURTLES THE TURTLES WEREN'T SO BAD BUT AS FOR THE TIGERS HE WASN'T SO SURE
HE DIDN'T MIND HANDLING THE RAW MEAT HE HAD TO FEED TO THE TIGERS HIS MAIN OBJECTION WAS TO BEING EATEN
NO ONE COULD BLAME FRED REALLY SINCE NO ONE REALLY WANTS TO BE EATEN
SOME PEOPLE DO LIKE TO BITE THEIR FINGER NAILS BUT FRED WASN'T A NAIL BITER SO BEING EATEN WAS DEFINITELY NOT SOMETHING HE LOOKED FORWARD TO EACH AFTERNOON AT THREE O'CLOCK WHEN IT WAS TIME TO FEED THE TIGERS
FOR FRED WHEN IT CAME TO THE PANDAS HE HAD A WARM SPOT IN HIS HEART ACTUALLY FEEDING THE PANDAS WAIT UH ACTUALLY IT WAS EIGHTY FIVE POINT DEGREE SPOT ON HIS LEFT KIDNEY BUT THE POINT IS THAT HE WAS VERY FOND OF FEEDING THE PANDAS
THERE WERE THREE PANDAS AND THEY WERE KNOWN AS THE PAN FAMILY THEY WERE IN ORDER OF CUTENESS YIN YIN THE YOUNG DAUGHTER POO POO THE MOTHER AND MOO MAN THE GENTLE AND ALWAYS SLEEPY FATHER
MANY PEOPLE KNOW THAT PANDAS EAT BAMBOO A LOT OF IT A LOT OF BAMBOO CAN GET CAN GET QUITE HEAVY SO BECAUSE OF THE PANDAS FRED BECAME VERY STRONG AND WAS IN TERRIFIC SHAPE
BUT PHYSICAL FITNESS WAS NOT THE ONLY REASON THAT FRED LOVED THE PANDAS THE OTHER REASON WAS THAT ANYONE WHO GETS WITHIN THREE FEET OF A PANDA AUTOMATICALLY FALLS IN LOVE WITH THEM
IT WAS A LAW OF NATURE IN FURTHER DISTANCES PANDAS HAVE A STRANGE ALMOST MAGICAL EFFECT ON HUMAN BEINGS WHICH MAKES US WANT TO HUG AND SQUEEZE THINGS
FRED WAS NOT ALLOWED TO ACTUALLY HUG THE PANDA BEARS SINCE THAT HE COULD BE DANGEROUS SO ALL THE OTHER PEOPLE AT THE ZOO WOULD KNOW THAT THE PANDAS HAD JUST BEEN FED WHEN THEY SAW FRED HUGGING THE RATHER UN CUDDLY PALM TREE OUTSIDE OF THE PANDA'S HOME
IT IS INTERESTING TO POINT OUT AT THIS TIME THAT MORE S STUFFED PANDA BEARS ARE SOLD AT ZOO GIFT SHOPS THEN ALL OF THE OTHER STUFF ANIMALS COMBINED
THIS CAN ALMOST CERTAINLY BE ACCOUNTED FOR BY THIS STRANGE ALMOST MAGICAL EFFECT THAT THE PANDAS POSSESS
BUT EVERYTHING WAS NOT ALL BAMBOO AND HUGS AT THE ZOO
ONE MORNING FRED WAS FEEDING YIN YIN AND SAID OH YIN YIN I WISH THAT MORE PEOPLE WOULD COME TO VISIT THE ZOO
I KNOW I SHOULDN'T BE TELLING YOU THIS BUT WE MIGHT HAVE TO SELL YOU AND YOUR FAMILY TO THE BIG ZOO IN SAN ANGELES IF WE DON'T GET MORE MONEY
IT'S NOT THAT YOU AREN'T SELLING ENOUGH STUFFED PANDA BEARS IT'S JUST THAT THERE HAVEN'T BEEN ENOUGH PEOPLE COMING TO SEE YOU IN THE FIRST PLACE I THINK WHAT ZOOS NEEDS IS A GREAT ADVERTISING CAMPAIGN
FRED WAS STARTING TO FEEL THE UNCONTROLLABLE URGE TO HUG THE PANDA SO BEFORE HE RAN OFF TO HUG THE PALM TREE QUICKLY
SAID IT COSTS SO MUCH TO FEED YOUR PA PANDA BEARS I WOULD HATE IF YOU HAD TO LEAVE US AFTER ALL IT'S ONLY THE HOME YOU KNOW
SIL
BESIDES IF YOU LEAVE I'LL GET TERRIBLY OUT OF SHAPE NOW IF YOU EXCUSE ME I NEED TO SQUEEZE SOMETHING BEFORE I CAN SCREAM BUT YIN YIN AND THE YOUNG PANDA WAS NOT LISTENING TO FRED
FRED SHE WAS TALKING TO HER BEST FRIEND MAGGIE THE MAGPIE ABOUT GOING TO THE MOON YES THE BIG ONE IN THE SKY THAT IS MOST LIKELY NOT MADE OF CHEESE AND MOST CERTAINLY NOT MADE OF BAMBOO
YIN YIN AND HER BEST FRIEND MAGGIE THE MAGPIE WHO LOOKED A LOT LIKE A PANDA WOULD LOOK IF PANDAS WERE BIRDS WERE DISCUSSING ABOUT GOING TO THE MOON
HER MOTHER AND FATHER KNEW WHAT THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT SINCE THEY HADN'T THOUGHT OR TALKED MUCH OF OF ELSE SINCE YIN YIN SAID I WANT TO GO THERE AND POINTED TO THE MOON
ENOUGH OF THIS NONSENSE SAID YIN YIN'S MOTHER POO POO WHAT SORT OF NONSENSE IS THIS FOR A YOUNG PANDA BEAR
GOING TO THE MOON INDEED NONSENSE YOUR JOB IS TO BE CUTE SO PEOPLE WANT TO RUN OFF TO THE GIFT SHOP AND TO BUY PANDA BEAR DOLLS
IT'S SIMPLE ECONOMICS LIKE LIKE IT WE'RE NOT WE ARE SPOKESPEOPLE FOR THE PANDA STUFFED ANIMAL INDUSTRY WHICH YOUNG LADY HELPS PAY FOR THE BAMBOO B THAT YOU EAT SUCH NONSENSE GOING TO THE MOON SAID HER MOTHER POO POO
BUT I JUST LEARNED HOW TO MAKE MYSELF INTO A BALL AND ROLL TWO DAYS AGO AND I'VE BECOMING VERY GOOD AT IT I DON'T THINK IT WILL TAKE THAT LONG TO ROLL THERE SAID YIN YIN
YIN YIN'S FATHER MOO MAN DIDN'T THINK IT WAS VERY PROPER OR WISE FOR A YOUNG PANDA BEAR TO GO ROLLING OFF TO PLACES WHERE THERE WASN'T ANY BAMBOO BUT SHE WAS SUPPORTIVE OF HIS YOUNG DAUGHTER AND SHOWED HIS SUPPORT BY TAKING A NAP
BUT AFTER HE FELL ASLEEP HE DID MANAGE TO SAY I BELIEVE ROLLING IS A DECIDEDLY ROUND ABOUT WAY TO GO IF YOU MUST GO IT IT IT T'WOULD BE THE BEST TO FLY
NONSENSE SAID THE MOTHER I'M SO MAD I'M GOING TO LOOK AT THAT LADY OVER THERE AND MAKE HER WANT TO SQUEEZE HER SON CHEEKS HE SAID SPITEFULLY AN INSTANT LATER A YOUNG BOY WAS HEARD SAYING OUCH MOM CUT THAT OUT I'M SORRY TO SAY BUT MANY A LITTLE BOY'S CHEEKS HAVE BEEN MADE RAW WHEN MOTHER POO POO PANDA WAS UPSET
YIN YIN WAS ALWAYS ONE TO TAKE GOOD ADVICE FROM HER FATHER AND LESS THAN A WEEK LATER YIN YIN AND MAGGIE HAD BUILT A ROCKET SHIP OUT OF BAMBOO BAMBOO IS VERY WORKABLE SUBSTANCE AND PANDAS TEND TO HANDLE BAMBOO A LOT SO THAT SO THAT THIS IN ITSELF WAS NOT THAT ASTONISHING AT LEAST TO THE YIN YINS PARENTS FRED SURE WAS IMPRESSED THOUGH
ONE TWO THREE TO THE MOON THEY ALL THEY SAID TOGETHER PULLING WITH ALL THEIR MIGHT I SEE YOUR WINGS FLAPPING BUT WE DON'T SEEM TO BE GOING ANYWHERE SAID YIN YIN
HMM HEAVIER THAN I THOUGHT I THINK WE WILL NEED MORE MAGPIES SAID MAGGIE YES BUT HOW MANY MORE YIN YIN SAID I'M NOT SURE EXACTLY REPLIED MAGGIE
THE FATHER WATCHING THIS ALL THROUGH ONE EYE FOR HE ALWAYS HAD AT LEAST ONE EYE ASLEEP AT ALL TIMES SAID T'WOULD BE THE BEST TO ASK THE OWL THEN CLOSED HIS EYE
SO MAGGIE FLEW TO THE OWL AND ASKED FOR HIS ADVICE OH WISE OWL I HAVE A QUESTION THAT I FEAR ONLY YOU CAN ANSWER SHE SAID
HOW TO TURN YOUR HEAD ALL THE WAY AROUND WITH GETTING A TERRIBLE PAIN IN YOUR NECK SAID OWL
THE OWL INSTANTLY REPLIED TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND AND SEVENTY SIX GIVE OR TAKE TWO A WEEK LATER MAGGIE MANAGED TO ROUND UP TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND AND SEVENTY EIGHT MAGPIES SHE COULD BE A VERY PERSUASIVE LITTLE BIRD WHEN SHE WANTED
A WEEK LATER DESPITE MUCH FLAPPING THEY WERE STILL TRYING AND TO GET THE ROCKET IN THE AIR IT TURNS OUT THAT THE OWL DIDN'T TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION THAT ONCE YOU GET OVER ONE THOUSAND MAGPIE TOGETHER THEY TEND TO FIGHT AND CAN'T AGREE ON A SINGLE THING
<br> NOW WHILE ALL THIS WAS GOING ON WHAT DO YOU SUPPOSED FRED WAS DOING
WHILE WHY HE WAS FEEDING THE PANDAS LIKE HE WAS SUPPOSED TO SO ONE DAY AFTER SO ONE DAY AFTER FRED HAD FED THE PANDAS AND WAS HUGGING THE PALM TREE THE ZOO MANAGER CAME UP TO HIM AND SAID WHAT IS GOING ON WITH YOUR PANDAS WITH YOUR PANDAS FRED I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT
IT'S TAKEN ME A COUPLE OF WEEKS TO FIGURE IT OUT BUT I THINK YIN YIN WANTS TO GO TO THE MOON AND MAGPIES WANT TO TAKE HER SAID FRED
OH WELL THAT MAKES SENSE THEN SAID THE MANAGER DID YOU KNOW THAT SINCE THE LITTLE PANDA BUILT THAT BAMBOO ROCKET SHIP AND THOSE MAGPIE'S STARTED FLUTTERING ABOUT THAT THE ZOO'S PROFITS HAVE GONE UP FOUR GONE UP FOUR THOUSAND PERCENT THIS IS JUST THE TYPE OF EXPOSURE WE NEEDED THOSE PANDAS WILL BE WITH US FOR A LONG TIME
FRED THOUGHT ABOUT IT AND SAID YOU KNOW I THINK WE SHOULD RENAME YIN YIN COLUMBUS THE ZOO KEEPER SAID GOOD HEAVENS MAN THAT IS A GREAT IDEA NO WAIT A SECOND I DON'T UNDERSTAND WELL SIR
<br> WHEN WHEN COLUMBUS SET OUT ON HIS SHIP HE WAS REALLY TRYING TO FIND A QUICKER WAY TO GET TO GET TO GET AROUND EUROPE IN ORDER TO IMPROVE TRADE HE WANTED TO BE A BUSINESS MAN BUT INSTEAD BECAME A GREAT EXPLORER
YES BUT WHAT DOES THAT HAVE TO DO WITH THE PANDAS MAN SAID THE ZOO PE ZOO KEEPER WELL IT SEEMS TO ME SIR THAT YIN YIN WANTED TO BE A GREAT EXPLORER AND INSTEAD BECAME A BUSINESS WOMAN
I SEE FRED ONE MORE ONE MORE THING SIR ABOUT THOSE MAGPIES FLYING ABOVE THE PANDAS DO YOU THINK THAT THE ZOO COULD PURCHASE ME A LARGE SIZED UMBRELLA
THE ZOO MANAGER LAUGHED AND WALKED AWAY BUT DID PURCHASE A FASHIONABLE YELLOW UMBRELLA FOR FRED THE NEXT DAY
BACK IN THE PANDA'S HOME THE MOTHER PANDA POO POO WAS VERY PROUD OF HER DAUGHTER AFTER ALL IF IT WEREN'T FOR YIN YIN THEY WOULD HAVE TO MOVE TH THEY WOULD HAVE THEY WOULD HAVE HAD TO MOVE THEIR WONDERFUL HOME BUT LATER WHEN FRED WALKED INTO THE PANDA'S HOME UNDER HIS NEW YELLOW UMBRELLA ALL SHE COULD THINK TO SAY WAS NONSENSE
AS FOR YIN YIN SHE WAS VERY PROUD TO BE RENAMED AFTER A FAMOUS EXPLORER AND SHE AND MAGGIE NEVER STOPPED TRYING TO GET TO THE MOON
WELL IT WAS ABOUT A PANDA NAMED YIN YIN THAT W WANTED TO GET TO THE MOON REALLY BAD AND
FRIEND MAGGIE THE MAGPIE GATHERED ALL THESE MAGPIES TO H TO HELP HER FLY THE ROCKETSHIP TO THE MOON CAUSE THE PANDA WAS TOO HEAVY
AND HER MOTHER THOUGHT IT WAS NONSENSE BUT H NONSENSE BUT HER FATHER WAS SUPPORTIVE
AND FRED RENAMED YIN YIN COLOMBUS BECAUSE HE THOUGHT THAT YIN YIN WAS TRYING TO BE A GREAT EXPLORER OF THE MOON
SIL
FRED WAS THE GUY THAT FED ALL THE PANDAS AND HE REALLY LIKED THE PANDAS A LOT AND HE DIDN'T WANT TO HAVE THEM MOVE AWAY BECAUSE THE ZOO RATINGS WERE LOW
<br>
WELL THE ZOO RATINGS UP WENT UP REALLY HIGH BECAUSE ALL THE PEOPLE LIKED SEEING LIKE THE ROCKETSHIP WITH MAGPIES AND EVERYTHING

HIS BOOTS CREAKED TOO SO LOUDLY BUT STILL HE WAS NOT AFRAID AT ALL ER NOT AT ALL AFRAID
SHE WILL BE GLAD TO SEE YOU BUT SHE HAS BEEN VERY BADLY FRIGHTENED
I DESIRE IT SO MUCH THAT I WILL TAKE NO REFUSAL
AND THE PRIZE CUP GREW CLEARER AND AND NEARER TO HER MENTAL VISION
BEHIND HER LAY THE SHIP A PICTURE NOT WITHOUT ITS LIGHTER SIDE
SIL
THE FIRST TIME I EVER TOOK AN AIRPLANE BY MYSELF IT WAS A FUN AND SCARY
I DIDN'T KNOW ANYONE AT ALL AND HAD TO GO ALL THE WAY FROM NEW YORK TO TEXAS WITHOUT MY PARENTS I WAS FLYING THERE TO SEE MY GRANDFATHER AND WE WERE GOING TO GO FISHING
I'VE ALWAYS THOUGHT FLYING WAS FUN YOU GO HIGHER THAN ANY MOUNTAIN AND YOU GO FASTER THAN ANY CAR BUT TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH WITH WITHOUT MY PARENTS THERE I WAS PRETTY NERVOUS
I GUESS IT WAS BECAUSE THE PLANE WAS SO LOUD AND I DIDN'T KNOW ANYONE I STARTED TO THINK WE MIGHT CRASH I DIDN'T LIKE TO THINK ABOUT THAT BUT I COULDN'T HELP IT THAT'S WHEN I MISSED MY PARENTS THE MOST BUT ONCE THE PLANE WAS IN THE AIR I WAS PRETTY GOOD
MY MOM GAVE ME A COLORING BOOK OF COOL LOOKING DRAGONS TO KEEP ME BUSY I COLORED THE DRAGON PICTURES ALL GREEN SO IT DIDN'T TAKE VERY LONG
I ONLY USED THE GREEN CRAYON BECAUSE IT WAS THE TALLEST AND I WANTED TO KEEP WANTED IT TO CATCH UP TO THE RED BROWN BLUE YELLOW PURPLE AND BLACK ONES
ONE THING ABOUT BEING BEING BY YOURSELF ON AN AIRPLANE IS THAT THE FLIGHT ATTENDANTS ARE VERY NICE TO YOU
I HAD SEVEN COLA'S AND FOUR GINGER ALE'S WHICH MADE ME HAVE TO GO TO THE BATHROOM EIGHT TIMES
I WAS GLAD THAT THERE WASN'T ANYONE NEXT TO ME THE PERSON NEXT TO ME WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY ANNOYED
EVENTUALLY THE FLIGHT ATTENDANT SEEMED TO GET A LITTLE ANNOYED THAT I HAD TO GO TO THE BATHROOM SO MUCH BUT IT WAS HER FAULT
SHE WAS THE ONE THAT KEPT TRYING TO GIVE ME PEANUTS I TOLD HER THAT I WANTED A BANANA SPLIT INSTEAD BUT SHE SAID THEY DON'T HAVE ANY BANANA SPLITS ON THE PLANE BUT SOMETIMES PEOPLE LIKE TO EAT PEANUTS ON THEIR BANANA SPLITS I
I TOLD HER THAT IT WAS THE PEANUTS THAT WERE MAKING ME SO THIRSTY IN THE FIRST PLACE AND THAT IF SHE COULD GET ME A BANANA SPLIT IT WOULD I WOULDN'T HAVE TO GO THE BATHROOM SO MUCH
SHE TOLD ME TO BE QUIET AND WATCH THE MOVIE I TRIED TO WATCH THE MOVIE BUT I HAD ALREADY ALREADY SEEN THAT ONE SO SO IT WAS BORING
THE FLIGHT ATTENDANT GAVE ME A DECK OF CARDS BUT SHE WOULDN'T PLAY GO FISH WITH ME SHE SAID SHE HAD TO HELP OTHER PASSENGERS
SIL
I HAD A GAME BOY IN MY BACKPACK MY BACKPACK WAS IN THE IN THE OVERHEAD THINGY
I TRIED TO PUSH THE BUTTON THAT LIGHTS UP OVER MY HEAD SO THE FLIGHT ATTENDANT WOULD COME BUT GUESS WHAT I WAS TOO SHORT TO REACH THE BUTTON SO I STARTED YELLING HEY PEANUT LADY HEY PEANUT LADY
SHE DIDN'T LIKE BEING CALLED PEANUT LADY BUT SHE DID GET MY GAME BOY SHE TOLD ME TO CALL HER JENNIFER INSTEAD
I PLAYED MY GAME BOY UNTIL I GOT MY NEW HIGH SCORE THEN JEN THEN JENNIFER CAME UP TO ME AND SAID SHE HAD A SURPRISE I THOUGHT GREAT MORE PEANUTS BUT IT WASN'T PEANUTS PEANUTS IT WAS SOMETHING REALLY COOL
SHE SAID THE CAPTAIN WAS INVITING INVITING ME TO SEE THE COCKPIT COCKPIT I THOUGHT I THOUGHT AWESOME I ALSO BOUGHT BROUGHT MY DECK OF CARDS IN THE CASE IN CASE OF THE PILOT WAS BORED AND WANTED WANTED TO PLAY GO FISH
JENNIFER TOOK ME INTO THE COCKPIT AND THERE WERE A MILLION BUTTONS AND LEVERS AND KNOBS AND STUFF
AT THE FIRST AT FIRST I THOUGHT WOW LOOK AT ALL THOSE BUTTONS THEN I THOUGHT THERE'S NO WAY THAT ANYONE CAN REMEMBER TO PUSH ALL THOSE BUTTONS AT THE RIGHT TIME WE ARE GOING TO CRASH
SIL
THE WAY I FIGURED IT MY GAME MY GAME BOY ONLY HAS FIVE BUTTONS AND I CAN'T GET PAST LEVEL THREE IMAGINE HOW HARD IT WOULD BE TO WORK ALL THOSE MILLIONS OF BUTTONS AND EAT PEANUTS
SIL
THE PILOT TOLD ME THAT IT WASN'T REALLY THAT HARD ONCE YOU PRACTICED THEN HE TOLD ME THAT HE ONCE PLAYED THE GAME I HAD ON MY GAME BOY AND HE COULDN'T EVEN PASS ONE LEVEL ONE
I S I SAID IF YOU CAN'T EVEN GET PAST LEVEL ONE THEN YOU'RE A PILOT AND YOU'RE A PILOT THEN I COULD BE A PILOT T TOO SINCE I'M MUCH BETTER AT PUSHING BUTTONS THAN YOU ARE
HE LAUGHED EVEN THOUGH I WASN'T JOKING HE S SAID HE THOUGHT I WOULD MAKE A GREAT PILOT SOMEDAY IF I WANTED TO BE
HE WAS REALLY NICE BUT HE WOULDN'T PLAY GO FISH WITH ME
FINALLY WE LANDED THAT THAT'S ALWAYS SCARY IT SEEMS LIKE THE PLANE IS GOING TOO FAST TO EVEN STOP BUT IT DOES
GRANDPA LAUGH LAUGHED AND TOOK ME STRAIGHT TO THE ICE CREAM SHOP I WAS WORTH THE WHOLE TRIP JUST TO EAT A BANANA SPLIT WITH GRANDPA
UHM WELL HE LIKE HI HE WENT ON AN AIR UHM THE KID DID
SIL
UHM HE HE WENT ON AN AIRPLANE RIDE TO SEE HIS GRANDPA

HEARING THESE WORDS JIM RESOLVED TO HIS CON CONQUER HIS ALARM BY HIMSELF
THEN HE SEEMED TO BREATHE MORE FREELY AND RECOVERED SOME OF HIS JAUNTY IMPEDIMENTS
THEN THE ROPES WERE ATTACHED AND EVERYONE PULLED VIGOROUSLY
NOT EVEN HER WRATH AT THE GIRL'S INSOLENCE COULD WHOLLY OVERCOME HER WONDER
THE MISTRESS STOOD STOCK STILL HOLDING HER HANDS AT LEVEL WITH HER THROAT
SHE HAD LOOSENED THE LID AND SHE WAS LAUGHING LAUGHINGLY SITTING ON IT
I SHOULD THINK YOU HAD AN IMAGINATION SURE ENOUGH SHE LAUGHED
DO YOU KNOW WHY I ASKED HER TO SEND ME THE MANUSCRIPT
THE WOMEN REPLIED ONLY BY VAN VANISHING AS THOUGH SUDDEN MIXED WITH THE AIR

SIL
THE SLOWEST TURTLE
SIL
EVERY FOUR YEARS TURTLES FROM ALL OVER THE LAND WOULD CRAWL TO THE GREAT POND
IT WOULD TAKE SOME TURTLES FROM FAR AWAY VILLAGES TWO WHOLE WEEKS JUST TO GET THERE
WHERE THERE WAS LOTS OF EATING AND LAUGHING TURTLES COULD CATCH UP WITH THEIR FRIENDS THEY HAD NOT SEEN SINCE THE LAST FESTIVAL
EVERYTHING ABOUT THE FESTIVAL WAS FUN BUT THE MAIN EVENT WAS THE GREAT TURTLE RACE
<unk> THE WINNER OF THE GREAT TURTLE RACE WAS SO IMPORTANT THAT HE DIDN'T HAVE TO MOVE FOR FOUR YEARS UNTIL THE NEXT FESTIVAL
THE LAST TURTLE OR THE LESS A TURTLE MOVES THE BIGGER THEY GOT S AND THE LONGER THEY LIVE
SO YOU CAN SEE THE WINNING G GREAT RACE IS A GREAT HONOR
THE TURTLE CUP WAS A TROPHY THAT THE WINNER COULD TAKE HOME TO THEIR VILLAGE
IT HAD BEEN IN A SLUDGE POND FOR FIFTY YEARS BECAUSE NO ONE COULD EVER BEAT THE THEIR TURTLE THIS WAS THE FAMOUS TURTLE THERE WAS
HE WAS THE SLOWEST TURTLE OF ALL TIME
HE HADN'T M HADN'T HAD TO MOVE FOR OVER FIFTY YEARS
HE WAS ONE OF THE BIGGEST AND MOST RESPECTED AND ALSO ONE OF THE TRICKIEST TURTLES THERE WAS
THERE WERE S MANY LEGENDS ABOUT HIM IT WAS IT WAS RUMORED HE WAS SO SLOW HIS HEART WOULD ONLY BEAT ONCE A DAY
HIS NAME WAS MUD AND HE WAS THE GREATEST CHAMPION OF HIS OF IN THE HISTORY OF SHELL DWELLER'S FESTIVAL HE WAS UNBEATABLE
WHEN MUD W IN WAS IN HIS PRIME THERE WAS A NEW TURTLE B BORN IN THE BLUE POND THIS TURTLE WAS NAMED SWISH
WHEN SWISH WAS BORN EVERYONE THOUGHT HE WAS W A LITTLE SLOW BUT HE GOT A LITTLE OLDER AND THE OLDER TURTLES BEGAN TO REALIZE THAT SWISH WAS REALLY REALLY SLOW
WHEN HIS MOTHER CALLED HIM IN FOR DINNER HE DIDN'T MAKE IT HOME UNTIL BREAKFAST THE NEXT MORNING AND HE WAS ONLY A FOOT AWAY
BLUE POND WAS A NICE VILLAGE LOCATED ABOUT THREE DAYS CRAWL FROM GREAT POND
THEY THEY ALL FELT A LITTLE SAD BECAUSE THEY HADN'T HELD THE TURTLE CUP IN OVER SEVEN HUNDRED YEARS
SO WITH SWISH THEY TH THEY THOUGHT MAYBE JUST MAYBE HE COULD BRING IT BACK TO BRING BACK THE TURTLE CUP TO THEIR LITTLE POND
EVERYONE TREATED SWISH DIFFERENTLY
FOR EXAMPLE MISTER PEEKS LOCATED SHELL CLEANER WOULD SAY HEY THE SWISH ER HEY THERE SWISH DO YOU WANT A FREE SHELL WAXING TODAY

YOU WE ALL WANT YOU TO LOOK GOOD WHEN YOU BRING HOME THE CUP MRS MRS SNAPPER WOULD SAY HI SWISHY DO YOU WANT TO COME HAVE SOME YUMMY PIE TO FILL YOU UP AND SLOW YOU DOWN FOR THE BIG RACE
A FAT TURTLE IS A SLOW TURTLE
SIL
MRS SNAPPER WAS N NEVER NICE TO ANYONE BUT SHE WAS BEING NICE TO SWISH
MISTER PEEKS WOULD NEVER DO ANYTHING FOR FREE BUT HE WAS GOING TO GIVE SWISH A FREE WELL S SH SHELLS WAXING
THIS WAS THE KIND OF THING THAT SWISH WOULD GET ALL THE TIME
I'LL I NEVER PROMISED THAT I WOULD WIN THE RACE I CAN'T BEAT MUD ANYWAY I HEARD ONCE IT TOOK HIM THREE DAYS JUST TO YAWN
SO ONE DAY HIS PARENTS HIS PAR TOLD HIS PARENTS I DON'T WANT TO RACE
ALL THE TURTLES IN BLUE POND HELD A MEETING TO DISCUSS THE PROBLEM
THE MAYOR DOCTOR SOFTSHELL SAID THIS IS RIDICULOUS SWISH HAS TO RACE HEAR HE IS THE SLOWEST TURTLE I'VE EVERY SEEN EXCEPT FOR MUD OF COURSE WITHOUT HIM I DON'T HAVE WE DON'T HAVE A CHANCE
BUT HE DOESN'T WANT TO BE TREATED SPECIAL HE JUST WANTS TO BE NORMAL AND DOESN'T WANT ANY ANYONE TO HATE HIM BECAUSE HE CAN'T BEAT MUD
YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT EVERYTHING HE GIFTED IS BEING SLOW HE'S STILL VERY YOUNG AND SAID SWISH'S FATHER
WE NEVER THOUGHT OF THAT THEY ALL SAID THE TOWN AGREED TO TREAT SWISH LIKE A NORMAL TURTLE AND AFTER A WHILE SWISH DECIDED THAT HE WOULD PROUD HE WOULD BE PROUD TO RACE FOR HIS VILLAGE
WHEN THE TIME CAME FOR THE FESTIVAL DREW NEAR
ALL TURTLES IN THE LAND STARTED T TOWARDS THE GREAT POND SWISH HAD TO BE CARRIED ON HIS FATHER'S BACK SINCE IT WOULD HAVE TO TAKE HIM MONTHS TO GET TO GREAT POND BY HIMSELF
FINALLY AFTER THE LONG JOURNEY ALL THE TURTLES ARRIVED AT THE GREAT POND
THIS WAS SWISH'S FIRST EVER SHELL DWELLERS FESTIVAL AND HE THOUGHT THAT IT IT WAS THE MOST WONDERFUL THING HE HAD EVER SEEN
THERE WERE THOUSANDS OF TURTLES DIFFERENT SPECIES ALL HAVING A GREAT TIME
LOOK THERE'S YOUR COUSIN PEEK A BOO FROM BIG PUDDLE VILLAGE SWISH'S MOTHER SAID
YOU GET TO MEET ALL OF SORTS OF NEW TURTLES
SWISH WAS SUDDENLY VERY EXCITED HE TOLD HIS MOM YOU KNOW WHAT I'M GOING TO WIN THIS RACE
I KNOW IT AND THESE TURTLES WILL KNOW THAT BLUE POND RULES
I'M NOT AFRAID OF STUPID MUD
SWISH'S MOM SMILED AND SAID I KNOW YOU CAN WIN SWISH BUT IT'S AN HONOR JUST TO GET TO RACE SAID SWISH'S MOM
SWISH SAW A ROCK IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FIELD AND WONDERED
HOW COME THEY DON'T MOVE THAT BIG ROCK OUT OF THE FIELD IT SEEMS THAT EVERYONE'S IN THE WAY SAID SWISH
THAT'S NOT A ROCK SWEETIE THAT'S MOM THAT'S MUD
SWISH MADE A LOUD GULP SOUND
JUST DO YOUR BEST HIS MOM SAID
SWISHES FATHER SAID SON I HAVE SOMETHING TO TELL YOU AS YOU KNOW YOUR GREAT GREAT GRAND TURTLE RACED MUD ONCE
HE WASN'T AS SLOW AS YOU A AS SLOW AS YOU BUT HE DID TEACH ME ABOUT MUD'S DIRTY T TRICKS
WHEN HE WHISPERED IN SWISH'S EAR ALL THE TRICKS THAT THE GREAT GREAT GRAND TURTLE TAUGHT HIM
AFTER SEVEN DAYS OF PLAYING AND DANCING A BUG EATING FINALE THE DAY OF THE RACE CAME
THE MAYOR OF GREAT POND MRS TORT PO POSTED THE RULES ON THE RACE ON A TREE FOR EVERYONE TO SEE
THEY READ RULE NUMBER ONE THE GREAT RACE BEGINS AT SUNRISE AND ENDS AT SUNSET
RULE NUMBER TWO ALL TURTLES MUST RUN AS FAST AS THEY CAN AND THE TURTLE THAT IS CLOSEST TO THE STARTING LINE WINS
RULE NUMBER THREE NO TURTLE MAY PRETEND TO GO FASTER BUT GO SLOW INSTEAD ALL TURTLES MUST GO AS FAST AS THEY CAN AT ALL TIMES
SINCE TURTLES NEVER CHEAT THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT RULE TO BREAK THIS RULE WOULD MEAN TO GET TO END THE GREAT TURTLE RACE FOREVER
RULE NUMBER FOUR NO TURTLE MAY FALL ASLEEP SINCE YOU SINCE IF ARE ASLEEP YOU AREN'T RUNNING AS FAST AS YOU CAN
SWISH READ THE RULES EVEN THOUGH HE KNEW BY HEART H H HE KNEW THEM BY HEART THEN HE HEARD THE MAYOR SAY RUNNER'S PLEASE TAKE YOUR POSITIONS
THE SLOWEST TURTLES FROM EACH POND WERE CARRIED TO THE STARTING LINE BY MEMBERS OF THEIR VILLAGES
THERE WERE ABOUT THREE HUNDRED TURTLES RACING THEY WERE ALL THE SLOWEST OF THE SLOW
THE TURTLES ALL STRETCHED AND S THOUGHT REALLY SLOW SLOW THOUGHTS AS THEY DID THE SKY TURNED FROM BLACK TO DARK BLUE
THEY LOOK AT THE HORIZON AND SAW THE SUN WAS STARTING THE RISE JUST THEN THE MAYOR SAID READY SET SLOW AND OFF THEY WENT
THE TURTLES WERE VERY VERY VERY SLOW SO IT TOOK THEM LONG TIME BEFORE THEY COULD BEFORE ANYONE COULD FIGURE OUT WHICH TURTLES WERE THE SLOWEST
AFTER A FEW HOURS MOST OF THE TURTLES HAD GONE A FEW FEET
EXCEPT FOR TWO SWISH AND MUD WERE BOTH AT BACK AT THE STARTING LINE
IT TOOK IT LOOKED AS IF NEITHER OF THEM HAD MOVED AT ALL
THEY WERE BOTH MOVING OF COURSE BECAUSE BUT THEY WERE SO SLOW THAT IT WAS HARD TO TELL
AFTER SIX HOURS MUD AND SWISH WERE STILL TIED AND ONLY MOVED A FEW INCHES
BUT BY NOW TURTLES WERE USUALLY WAY AHEAD OF MUD BUT THIS TIME SWISH WAS JUST AS SLOW
MUD KNEW THAT HE WOULD THAT THIS WAS BEING THE CLOSEST RACE HE HAD EVER WAS ACTUALLY GETTING A LITTLE BIT SCARED
WHO IS WAS THIS YOUNG PUNK HE THOUGHT TO HIMSELF MUD AND SAID TO SWISH THERE'S NO WAY THAT THAT A TURTLE AS YOUNG AS YOU CAN BE AS SLOW
EVEN I WAS FASTER WHEN FASTER THAN YOU WHEN I WAS YOUR AGE YOU'RE CHEATING YOU'RE NOT GOING TO
SIL
RUIN THE GREAT RACE FOREVER
BUT SWISH WOULDN'T LET MUD SCARE HIM
YOU'RE JUST TRYING TO MAKE ME QUIT
SIL
I'M NOT GOING TO FALL FOR YOUR TRICKS HE SAID TURTLES NEVER CHEAT AND I'M NOT AND I'M A TURTLE WITH HONOR
WHEN MUD TRIED ANOTHER TRICK HE STARTED SINGING A SOFT BEAUTIFUL LULLABY SWISH STARTED YAWNING
TH HE WAS TIRED FROM RACING THOUGH HE WOULD NICE JUST TO LISTEN TO MUD'S SWEET VOICE AND FALL ASLEEP
THEN SNAPPED OUT OF IT AND REMEMBERED HIS FATHER HAD WARNED HIM OUT OF HIS TRICK
HE REACHED I HE REACHED IN T HIS SHELL AND PULLED OUT A COUPLE OF EARPLUGS
HE PUT THEM ON HE PUT THE EARPLUGS IN HIS EARS AND COULDN'T HEAR MUD'S SINGING ANYMORE
MUD KEPT SINGING HIS LULLABY FOR A FEW HOURS BUT THEN HE STOPPED RIGHT BEFORE SUNSET
THE SUN THE CROWD THOUGHT HE MUST HAVE REALIZED HIS SINGING TRICK WASN'T WORKING
BUT THEN BUT THEN RIGHT AT THE END RIGHT BEFORE THE SUNSET SWISH STARTED TO PULL AHEAD OF MUD
OH NO SHOUTED THE FANS MUD'S WINNING LOOKS IT LOOKS LIKE MUD IS STILL THE GREATEST TURTLE OF THEM ALL
THEN THE SUNSET WENT DOWN
MUD WAS THE CLOSEST TURTLE TO THE STARTING LINE
SWISH WAS SAD THAT HE HAD LOST BUT ALL THE TURTLES FROM BLUE POND CHEERED FOR SWISH
THEY WERE VERY FAR PROUD T HE GAVE MUD SUCH A CLOSE RACE SWISH WAS HAPPY TOO BUT DEEP DOWN INSIDE HE KNEW HE WAS JUST AS SLOW AS MUD
THE MAYOR OF PONDLAND WENT TO PRESENT THE TURTLE CUP TO SLUDGE POND AGAIN
SIL
HE ANNOUNCED WELL MUD IT LOOKS LIKE YOU'VE DONE IT SLUDGE POND WINS THE TURTLE CUP AGAIN THIS IS THE TIME IT WOULD BE A A BIT NEXT TIME IT WOULD BE A LITTLE BIT CLOSER THAN YOU WOULD HAVE LIKED I I'LL BET
WHAT WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO SAY TO ALL THE TURTLES TO THE FESTIVAL THE CROWD STARTED YELLING SPEECH SPEECH
MUD DIDN'T ANSWER THE MAYOR TAPPED MUD ON THE SH SHELL AND SAID HELLO HELLO MUD
MUD DIDN'T ANSWER IN FACT MUD WAS ASLEEP
MUD WAS ACTUALLY SUNG HIMSELF TO SLEEP
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN HE SAID MUD FROM SLUDGE POND HAS BEEN DISQUALIFIED FOR SLEEPING DURING THE RACE
THIS MEANS WE WILL THAT WE HAVE A NEW CHAMPION THE REAL WINNER IS SWISH SOFTBELLY OF BLUE POND THE CROWD WENT WILD
MRS TORT WENT UP TO SWISH GAVE HIM THE TURTLE CUP SHE SAID SWISH YOU ARE THE YOUNGEST WINNER OF THE GREAT TURTLE RACE THAT WAS THE MOST EXCITING FINISH I'VE EVER HAD
I THINK THAT YOU WILL BE A GREAT CHAMPION FOR MANY YEARS SINCE TURTLES ONLY GET SLOWER WITH AGE THE FOR THE FIRST TIME IN SIX HUNDRED YEARS I WOULD LIKE TO PRESENT THE TURTLE CUP TO BLUE POND
THE CROWD WENT WILD AGAIN SWISH TOOK THE CUP THAT DAY FOR THE FIRST TIME
HE WOULD TAKE IT MANY MORE TIMES AFTER THAT
IT WAS BECAUSE OF SWISH THAT BLUE POND BECAME THE MOST RESPECTED POND IN THE LAND
HE WOULD NEVER LOSE THE TURTLE CUP FOR THE REST OF HIS LONG LIFE
BUT THROUGH THOUGH HE BECAME THE GREATEST BI AND BIGGEST TURTLE OF ALL TIME
MUCH GREATER OR BIGGER THAN MUD
HE WAS ALWAYS MADE SURE THAT NO ONE TREATED HIM SPECIAL THAT HE AND THAT HE TREATED EVERYONE LIKE HE WANTED TO BE TREATED LIKE A TURTLE WITH HONOR
SIL
ONCE THERE WAS A LITTLE T K POND NAMED BLUE POND UHM AND EVERY YEAR ALL THE PONDS WOULD COME TOGETHER EVERY FOUR YEARS FOR A FESTIVAL
SIL
AND THEY WOULD HAVE A RACE AFTER A PARTING FOR A LONG TIME AND THEY HAD TO RUN AS FAST AS THEY CAN THEY COULDN'T DO ANY TRICKS THEY COULDN'T CHEAT AND THEY HAD TO BE AWAKE THE WHOLE TIME FROM SUNSET TO SUNUP
AND THEY WHOEVER WAS CLOSEST TO THE STARTING LINE WON WHEN THE SUN WENT DOWN
SIL
AND SO THERE WAS THIS LITTLE TURTLE NAMED SWISH AND HE WAS REALLY REALLY REALLY SLOW
AND WHEN HE WAS FOUR YEARS OLD HE WENT TO THE
SIL
GREAT TURTLE RACE AND HE FACED THE CHAMPION MUD WHO HAD WON IT SIXTY YEARS IN A ROW AND HE LOST BUT THEN AT THE END WHEN MUD HAD TO MAKE A SPEECH HE WAS ASLEEP AND HE GOT DISQUALIFIED FOR SLEEPING SO SWISH WON
AND THEY TOOK HIM HOME AND HE BECAME REALLY OLD AND HE WON THE RACE A LOT OF TIMES AFTER THAT
SIL
I GUESS I'LL BUY A FEW SNAKES SINCE THEY L LOOK SO FUNNY COILED UP
SIL
SEE THE WISDOM OF MY CHOICE HE SAID HOLDING UP THE LARGE LEAF OF GOLD
BUT I AM TOO OLD TO ENDURE YOUR SHAME AND MY MISERY MUCH LONGER
SIL
RATHER WOULD I FACE THREE STRONG MEN THAN I YOUNG DAMSEL THEN THEN ONE YOUNG DAMSEL
SIL
I WOULD LOVE DEARLY TO HAVE THESE PEOPLE DESCRIBE THEIR TRAVEL THEIR TRAVELS
SIL
THROUGHOUT THESE CONVERSATIONS <unk> SAM HODGE SELDOM SPOKE
NOW HE HAS GONE OFF AGAIN FOR THE GAME IS GETTING SCARCE
YES MY LORD SAID THE MAN HIS SUNBURNED FACE REDDENING
EVEN IF THERE
SIL
THERE HAS BEEN SOME LITTLE MISTAKE THAT COULD I THAT WHAT COULD I DO NOW TO FIX IT
SIL
SIL
ASSORTED <unk> PART ROAMED IN THE JUNGLE TOGETHER
SIL
SIL
THE EARLY LOOK LOOKED AT IT AND THE CORNERS LOOKED AT IT A AND THE CORNERS OF HIS EYE OF HIS MOUTH TWITCHED A LITTLE
IF GOD <unk> SPARES BETH I NEVER WILL COMPLETE AGAIN WHISPERED MEG EARNESTLY
SIL
THESE THOUGHTS HAUNTED HIM ALL DAY AND HE DREAMT THEM ALL NIGHT
SIL
SHE COULD SEE NOTHING EXCEPT THE MORNING GLORIES WHICH COVERED THE SIDE OF THE PORCH
WHEN E WE NEVER KNEW THAT SUCH STRANGE PEOPLE ACCENTED ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD
SHE MUST BEGIN WITH THE CHINESE DYNASTY AND END WITH WITH JAPAN
FOR YOU AND ME THERE IS NOTHING TO HOPE FOR NOTHING BEYOND WHAT WE HAVE
SIL
IN THE DEEP GLOOM SHE COULD NOT SEE THE ANGER WHICH DARKENED HER FACE
SIL
SHE WANTS TO GIVE THE BOY AN EXTREMELY BAD OPINION FOR ME
I DON'T I KNOW THAT I KNOW THE COUNTRY SALT LAW JUST AS WELL AS I AS YOU DO
SIL
HOW STRANGE THAT A LIVE ANIMAL SHOULD GROW ON A SALT LIKE A FLOWER
SIL
ROOSTER JOHN
SIL
THEIR PROBLEMS STARTED WHEN THEY RAN OUT OF WATER THANKFULLY SOMEONE WAS DIGGING A HOLE AND FOUND WATER
BUT SOON AFTER THAT THEY STARTED TO GET FLIES
SIL
THEY GOT TONS AND TONS OF FLIES
SIL
OF FLEAS
SIL
THEN THE FLEAS STOPPED BUT JUST THEN A MAN MOVED INTO THE TOWN WHO PLAYED A FLUTE A FLUTE SO BADLY THAT PEOPLE WOULD RUN AWAY SCREAMING
MAYBE A POORLY PLAYED FLUTE DOESN'T SOUND ALL THAT BAD ABOUT
SIL
BUT JUST TRY TO IMAGINE SOMEONE SCRATCHING A CHALKBOARD WITH A F WITH A FORK FORK AND THEN MULTIPLY THAT TIMES A HUNDRED
THAT'S HOW THE FLUTE SOUNDS WHEN THE GUY WHEN THIS GUY PLAYED IT
SIL
I'M SERIOUS STILL I'LL IT'S NOT A BAD
SIL
IT'S NOT AS BAD AS MILLIONS OF FLEAS I SUPPOSE
SIL
THE BAD THE BAD FLUTE PLAYER WAS ROOSTER JOHN
<br>
HE WASN'T CALLED ROOSTER JOHN YET HE THAT CAME LATER
HE WAS A NEW TOWN
SIL
DEN DENTIST
SIL
HE WAS A EXCELLENT DENTIST BUT HIS REAL LOVE WAS MUSIC HE PLAYED MANY MUSIC MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS SUCH AS GUITAR THE TUBA THE PIANO
SIL
AND THE CLARINET
SIL
HOWEVER YOU HOWEVER SOME FOR SOME REASON THE WAY HIS MOUTH WAS SUCH
SIL
WAS SHAPED MADE FOR A FLUTE
SIL
AWFUL THE UHM HOWEVER FOR THE SOME REASONS THE WAY HIS MOUTH WAS SHAPED
SIL
SHAPED MADE HIS FLUTE HIS FLUTE SOUND AWFUL
SIL
WE CAN'T YET WE CAN'T LET YOU PLAY THE FLUTE ANYMORE JOHN SAID POLICE CHIEF S SAID POLICE CHIEF SANDERS
THE NEIGHBORS ARE COMPLAINING AND THE CATS AND DOGS ARE TRYING TO CHEW OFF THEIR EARS
BUT I HAVE TO PLAY I WAS BORN I WAS BORN TO DO IT I DON'T KNOW WHY
SIL
BUT I FEEL LIKE I HAVE TO OR ELSE
SIL
OR ELSE BAD THINGS WILL HAPPEN
SIL
<unk> LOOK JOHN YOU'LL HEAR I'VE HEARD YOU PLAY THE CLARINET YOU'RE QUITE GOOD WHY DON'T YOU PLAY THAT INSTEAD SAID CHIEF SANDERS
SIL
OH THAT'S A NICE INSTRUMENT BUT IT'S JUST NOT THE FLUTE I EVEN WROTE YOU A SONG CHIEF SANDERS IT'S CALLED
SIL
COUPES AND COPS AND ROBBERS
THEN HE PLAYED THE SONG THE
SIL
THE POLICE CHIEF HATED THE SOUND SO MUCH THAT HE THREW JOHN IN JAIL
BUT THERE CAN'T KEEP JOHN BUT THEY CAN'T KEEP JOHN IN JAIL SINCE HE WASN'T ALREADY BREAKING ANY LAWS SO THERE WAS NOTHING THE POLICE COULD DO
BESIDES EVERYBODY LOVED JOHN
SINCE HE HAD BECOME THE TOWN DEN DENTIST EVERYBODY'S TEETH
SIL
WERE MUCH WHITER THEN AND CLEANER THEN
SIL
NO ONE HAD ANY
SIL
CAVITIES AND NO ONE HAD ANY CAVITIES
SIL
SO THERE WAS A PROBLEM IN THE LITTLE TOWN OF FRANKSVILLE
SIL
THAT SOUND THAT SHOULD THAT THEY SHOULD DO THAT
SIL
WHAT SHOULD THEY DO THEY CAN'T KEEP JOHN IN JAIL AND THEY WANT TO KICK HIM OUT OF THE OUT OF TOWN BECAUSE THEY ALL HAVE SU
SIL
THEY CAN'T
SIL
WAIT THEY CAN'T THEY COULDN'T KEEP JOHN IN JAIL AND THEY DON'T WANT TO KICK HIM OUT OF TOWN BECAUSE THEY ALL HAVE SUCH NICE TEETH
SO THEY DECIDE THAT JOHN COULD PLAY THE FLUTE AND EVERYBODY ELSE WOULD HAVE TO WEAR EARPLUGS
SIL
WELL I'M SURE YOU GUESSED THAT I DIDN'T THAT THAT DIDN'T WORK NOBODY COULD HEAR ANYTHING PEOPLE WERE GETTING INTO CAR ACCIDENTS AND
SIL
EVERYBODY LOOKED REALLY SILLY AT DANCES DANCING TO MUSIC THEY COULDN'T HEAR
SIL
WAIT EVERYBODY LOOKED REALLY SILLY AT DANCES DANCING TO MUSIC THEY COULDN'T HEAR
SIL
THEY JUST CAN'T LEAD A NORMAL THEY JUST CAN'T LEAD A NORMAL LIFE
THEN THEY DECIDE TO LOWER HIM DOWN
SIL
A WELL AND LET HIM PLAY DOWN WHERE YOU WHERE NO ONE COULD HEAR HIM
JOHN THOUGHT THAT WAS AN OK IDEA BUT THERE WAS NO THERE WAS AN ECHO IN THE WELL AND THAT MADE THE FLUTE SOUND LOUDER
<br>
WINDOWS WERE BREAKING ALL DAY AND ALL THE COWS IN TOWN STARTED TO MAKE SO SOUR MILK
SIL
THE LOCAL SCIENTIST DOCTOR WONG CA CAME UP WITH AN IDEA HE THOUGHT THAT IF HE MADE A NEW MOUTHPIECE
SIL
ESPECIALLY SHAPED FOR JOHN'S MOUTH THEN PERHAPS HE COULD PLAY A FLUTE NORMALLY
SIL
AND GUESS WHAT IT WORKED DOCTOR
SIL
DOCTOR WONG WAS THE WAS THE TOWN HERO THE FLUTE SOUNDED NORMAL AND IT TURNED TO
SIL
AND IT TURNED OUT JOHN COULD PLAY IT IT QUITE WELL
THE PEOPLE IN THE TOWN DECIDED TO HAVE A GREAT BIG PARADE
SIL
IN FRANKSVILLE TO CELEBRATE THE FACT THAT FOR ONCE THERE WAS NO WATER PROBLEM NO FLY PROBLEM AND
SIL
NO FLUTE PROBLEM
THEN SUDDENLY A FLY LANDED ON A LITTLE GIRL THEN A FLY LANDED ON SOMEONE ELSE
<br>
THEN SOME LANDED ON A BUNCH OF PEOPLE
THEN PRETTY SOON TON TONS OF FLIES WERE LANDING ON EVERYONE
<unk>
BEFORE THEY KNEW IT THE TOWN WAS FILLED WITH FLIES AGAIN
SIL
OH NO SAID CHIEF SANDERS
<br>
JUST WHEN TH JUST WHEN
<br>
THINGS WERE GOING GOOD IN FRANKSVILLE JOHN DIDN'T
SIL
DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO HE JUST KEPT
SIL
KEPT ON PLAYING HIS FLUTE THE FLIES WERE ANNOYING SO HE WOULD
SIL
SWAT AT THEM WITH HIS HANDS OR
SIL
AND
SIL
ACTUALLY SMASHED INTO A IN WAIT
SIL
THE FLIES WERE ANNOYING HE COULD NOT HE WOULD SWAT AT THEM WITH HIS HANDS OR OR EVEN HIS NEW FLUTE
HE STARTED SHAKING THE FLUTE TO GET THE FLIES OFF THE
SIL
OFF AND ACCIDENTALLY SMASHED IT INTO PIECES BUT
SIL
HE WAS VERY UPSET AT FIRST THEN HE SAID OH WELL GOOD THING I I BROUGHT MY OLD FLUTE AS BACK UP
NO NO PLEASE DON'T PLAY YOUR OLD FLUTE BEGGED DOCTOR WONG
BUT IT WAS TOO LATE JOHN HAD STARTED PLAYING
SIL
WHEN THE TOWNSFOLK HEARD THE NOISE THEY COULDN'T EVEN SWAT AT THE FLIES ANYMORE
THEY HAD TO COVER THEIR EARS FROM THE HORRIBLE SOUND THE FLIES WOULD LAND ALL OVER THE PEOPLE AND THEY COULDN'T SWAT THEM OFF
IT WAS GROSS THEN SUDDENLY THE FLIES FELL FLEW AWAY FA FAST AS THEY COULD
DOCTOR WONG THOUGHT FOR A SECOND THEN
SIL
THEN PRONOUNCED IT'S THE FLUTE SOUND THE FLIES HATE JOHN'S FLUTE PLAYING AS MUCH AS WE DO JOHN THE DENTIST IS DRIVING THE FLIES AWAY
IT WAS THEN THAT THE PEOPLE OF FRANKSVILLE REALIZED THAT THEY WOULD HAVE TO TAKE A GOOD
SIL
A
SIL
GOOD WITH THE BAD BECAUSE SO BAD AS THE FLUTE SOUNDED IT WAS A LOT BETTER THAN THOUSANDS OF FLIES CRAWLING ALL OVER THEM
FROM THEN ON JOHN WOULD WAKE UP THE SUN AT SUNRISE WITH LIKE A ROOSTER AND PLAY TO KEEP THE FLIES AWAY
UHM IT WAS ABOUT ROOSTER JOHN AND
SIL
<br> HOW HE PLAYED A HI HOW HE PLAYED A FLUTE AND IT WAS PRETTY BAD
SO THE SCIENTIST GAVE HIM A NEW FLUTE AND IT SOUNDED BETTER AND HE BROKE IT BY TRYING TO SHOO AWAY SOME FLIES
AND
SIL
<br> UHM HE BROKE IT
SIL
<br> AND
SIL
AND SO HE USED HIS OLD FLUTE AND UHM HE SCARED AWAY THE FLIES WITH IT SO THEN HE GOT UP WHEN THE SUN RISED LIKE A ROOSTER <unk> AND PLAYED HIS FLUTE TO KEEP ALL THE FLIES AWAY AND THAT'S HOW HE GOT HIS NAME <br>
THE RED LEAVES WERE BLOWN AROUND IN MILLIONS BY THE WIND
BEHIND LAY THE SHIP A PICTURE NOT WITHOUT ITS LI LIGHTER SIDE
AND MEANWHILE BY THE FURTHER RIVER BANK CAME ROSALIND WITH MUSHROOMS IN HER SKIRT
SIL
NOW GO AND ANSWER YOUR NOTE AND LET ME FINISH THIS SPLENDID STORY
MORE COURAGE THAN MY BROTHER THAN MY POOR BROTHER WHO STANDS THERE LIKE A COWARD
SHE RUSHED FRANTICALLY ACROSS THE APARTMENT SEIZED HER HOOD AND RAN FROM THE COTTAGE
THEY CARRY THEMSELVES AS IF THEY HAD BEEN DRILLED BOTH MEN AND WOMEN
LINDA NOT BEING OVERBURDENED WITH PARTICIPATION DID NOT SEE THIS
I FEAR THAT WE SHALL HAVE ANOTHER SMART GALE HOWEVER IT WON'T LAST LONG
THE DAY ETHEL BROWN WAS SEVEN YEARS OLD SHE HAD A TEA PARTY
OF COURSE THERE'S NOTHING VERY ENTERTAINING HERE FOR YOU
THE YOUNGSTER <unk> LINGERED FOR A MOMENT OR TWO WATCHED MYLES AS HIS WORK
THESE WORDS QUITE DESTROYED THE HOPE THAT OF THE LATE HAD BEEN GLOWING WITHIN HER
ITS FLAVORS WHEN COOKED IS MORE EXQUISITE FAR THAN MUTTON <unk> OR OYSTER OR EGGS
I'M IN EARNEST HUCK JUST AS EARNEST AS EVER I WAS IN MY LIFE
HUMOR AND PATHOS MAKE IT ALIVE AND YOU HAVE FOUND YOUR STYLE AT LAST
SEAGRAVE KNELT BY HIS SIDE TOOK HIS HAND AND BURST INTO TEARS
NAN SAID IT WOULDN'T GROW IN OUR GARDEN BUT I BROUGHT SOME HOME TO TRY
HIS BOOTS CREAKED TOO SO LOUDLY BUT STILL HE WAS NOT AT ALL AFRAID
SHE WILL BE GLAD TO SEE YOU BUT SHE HAS BEEN VERY BADLY FRIGHTENED
HE TURNED HIS BACK ON THE BOY AND CONFERRED ASIDE WITH LAWRENCE
I DESIRE IT SO MUCH THAT I WILL TAKE NO REFUSAL
SIL
AND THE PRIZE CUP GREW LARGER AND NEARER TO HER MENTAL VISION
SIL
THE PANDA
WHY DID A PANDA WITH THE BEAUTIFUL GIRL NAME YIN YIN HAVE HER NAME CHANGED TO THE VERY UN BEAUTIFUL GIRL NAME COLUMBUS
IT WAS FRED'S IDEA SO L LET'S BEGIN WITH FRED
FRED FRED FRED FED THE PANDA BEARS THE TIGERS AND TURTLES THE TURTLES WEREN'T SO BAD BUT AS FOR THE TIGERS HE WASN'T SO SURE
HE DIDN'T MIND HANDLING THE RAW MEAT HE HAD TO FEED
SIL
TO THE TIGERS HE MEAN HIS MAIN OBJECT WAS TO BEGIN EATEN
SIL
NO ONE COULD BLAME FRED REALLY SINCE NO ONE REALLY WANTS TO BE EATEN
SOME PEOPLE DO LIKE TO BITE THEIR FINGER NAILS BUT EACH AFTERNOON AT THREE O'CLOCK WHEN IT WAS TIME TO FEED THE TIGERS FOR FRED WHEN IT CAME TO PANDAS HE HAD A WARM SPOT IN HIS HEART
ACTUALLY IT WAS A EIGHT
SIL
EIGHT EIGHTY FIVE POINT FIVE DEGREE SPOT ON HIS LEFT KIDNEY BUT THE POINT IS THAT HE WAS VERY FOND OF FEEDING THE PANDAS
THERE WERE THERE PAN THERE WERE THREE PANDAS AND THEY WERE KNOWN AS THE PAN FAMILY
THEY WERE IN ORDER OF CUTENESS YIN YIN THE YOUNG DAUGHTER POO POO THE MOTHER AND MOO MAN THE GENTLE AND ALWAYS SLEEPY FATHER
MANY PEOPLE KNOW THAT PANDAS EAT BAMBOO A LOT OF IT A LOT OF BAMBOO CAN GET QUITE HEAVY SO BECAUSE OF THE PANDAS FRED CAME VERY STRONG AND WAS IN TERRIFIC SHAPE
BUT PHYSICALLY FITNESS WAS NOT THE ONLY REASON THAT FRED LOVED THE PANDAS THE OTHER
SIL
REAS REASON WAS THAT ANY WHO ANYONE WHO GETS WITHIN THREE FEET OF A PANDA AUTOMATICALLY FALLS IN LOVE WITH THEM
IT'S A LAW OF NATURE
AT FURTHER DISTANCE PANDAS HAVE A STRANGE ALMOST MAGICAL EFFECT ON HUMAN BEINGS WHICH MAKES US WANT TO HUG AND SQUEEZE THINGS
FRED WAS NOT ALLOWED TO ACTUALLY HUG THE PANDA BEARS SINCE THEY COULD BE DANGEROUS SO ALL THE OTHER PEOPLE AT THE ZOO COULD WOULD KNOW THAT THE PANDAS HAD JUST BEEN FED WHEN THEY SAW FRED HUGGING
SIL
RATHER UN CUDDLY PALM TREE OUTSIDE OF THE PANDAS HOM HOME
IT IS INTERESTING TO POINT AT THIS TIME THAT MORE STUFFED PANDA BEARS ARE SOLD AT ZOO GIFT SHOPS THEN ALL OF THE OTHER STUFF ANIMALS COMBINED
THIS CAN ALMOST CERTAINLY BE ACCOUNTED FOR BY THIS STRANGE ALMOST MAGICAL EFFECT THAT THE PANDAS POSSESS
BUT EVERYTHING WAS NOT ALL BAMBOO AND HUGS AT THE ZOO
ONE MORNING FRED WAS FEEDING YIN YIN AND SAID OH YIN YIN I WISH THAT MORE PEOPLE COULD COME TO VISIT THE ZOO
I KNOW I SHOULDN'T BE TELLING YOU THIS BUT WE MIGHT HAVE TO SELL YOU AND YOUR FAMILY TO THE ZOO IN SAN ANGELES IF WE DIDN'T DON'T GET MORE MONEY
IT'S NOT THAT YOU AREN'T SELLING ENOUGH STUFFED PANDA BEARS IT'S JUST THAT THERE HAVEN'T BEEN ENOUGH PEOPLE COMING TO SEE YOU IN THE FIRST PLACE
I THINK THAT THE ZOO NEEDS IT'S A GREAT AD ADVERTISING CAMPAIGN
FRED WAS STARTING TO FEEL THE UNCONTROLLABLE URGE TO HUG THE PANDA
SO BEFORE HE RAN OFF TO HUG THE PALM TREE QUICKLY SAID IT COSTS SO MUCH TO FEED YOU PANDAS I WOULD HATE IF YOU HAD TO LEAVE US AFTER ALL IT'S THE ONLY HOME YOU KNOW
BESIDES IF YOU LEAVE I'LL GET TERRIBLY OUT OF SHAPE NOW IF YOU EXCUSE ME I NEED TO SQUEEZE SOMETHING BEFORE I SCREAM
BUT YIN YIN THE YOUNG PANDA
SIL
WAS NOT LISTENING TO FRED SHE WAS TALKING TO HER BEST FRIEND MAGGIE THE MAGPIE ABOUT GOING TO THE MOON YES THE BIG ONE IN THE SKY THAT IS ALMOST LIKE
SIL
LIKELY NOT MADE OF CHEESE AND MOST CERTAINLY NOT MADE OF BAMBOO YIN YIN AND HER BEST FRIEND MAGGIE THE MAGPIE WHO LOOKED LIKE A PANDA WOULD LOOK IF PANDAS <unk> WERE BIRDS WERE DISCUSSING ABOUT H GOING TO THE MOON
MOON
SIL
HER MOTHER THE F HER MOTHER AND FATHER KNEW THAT THEY WERE
SIL
TALKING ABOUT SINCE THEY HADN'T THOUGHT OR TALKED OF MUCH ELSE SINCE YIN YIN SAID I WANT TO GO THERE AND POINTED TO THE MOON
ENOUGH OF THIS NONSENSE NONSENSE SAID YIN YIN'S MOTHER POO POO WHAT SORT OF NONSENSE IS THIS FOR A YOUNG PANDA BEAR
GOING TO THE MOON INDEED NONSENSE YOUR JOB IS TO BE S
IS TO BE CUTE SO PEOPLE WANT TO RUN THE GIFT SHOP AND BUY PANDA BEAR DOLLS IT'S INDUSTRY WHICH YOUNG LADY HELPS PAY FOR THE BAMBOO THAT YOU EAT
SUCH NONSENSE GOING TO THE MOON SAID HER MOTHER POO POO
BUT I JUST LEARNED HOW TO MAKE MYSELF INTO A BALL AND ROLL TWO DAYS AGO AND I'VE BECOMING VERY GOOD AT IT
I DON'T THINK IT WILL TAKE THAT LONG TO ROLL THERE SAID YIN YIN
YIN YIN'S FATHER MOO MAN <unk> DIDN'T THINK IT WAS VERY PROPER T OR WISE FOR A YOUNG PANDA BEAR TO GO ROLLING OFF TO PLACES WHERE THERE WASN'T ANY BAMBOO
BUT HE WAS SUPPORTIVE OF HIS YOUNG DAUGHTER AND SHOWED HIS SUPPORT TAKING A N NAP
SIL
IS A DECIDEDLY ROUND ABOUT WAY TO GO IF YOU MUST GO IT
SIL
IT IT WOULDN'T BE BEST TO FLY
NONSENSE SAID THE MOTHER I'M SO MAD I'M GOING TO LOOK AT THE LADY OVER THERE AND MAKE HER WANT TO SQUEEZE HER SON CHEEKS
SIL
SHE SAID PIT SPITEFULLY
AN INSTANT LATER A YOUNG BOY WAS HEARD SAYING OUCH MOM CUT THAT OUT
I'M SORRY TO SAY BUT MANY BUT MANY A LITTLE BOY'S CHEEKS HAVE BEEN MADE RAW WHEN MOTHER POO POO PANDA WAS UPSET
SIL
YIN YIN WAS ALWAYS ONE TO MAKE GOOD ADVICE FOR HIS FATHER AND LESS THAN A WEEK LATER YIN YIN AND MAGGIE HAD BUILT A ROCKET SHIP OUT OF BAMBOO
BAMBOO IS VERY WORKABLE SUBSTANCE AND PANDAS TEND TO HANDLE BAMBOO A LOT SO THIS IN ITSELF WAS NOT THAT ASTONISH ASTONISHING AT LEAST TO YIN YINS PARENTS FRED SURE WAS IMPRESSED THOUGH
THE MAIN OBSTACLE IT TURNS OUT GETTING THE ROCKET SHIP OFF THE GROUND
MAGGIE FIGURED THAT IF SHE AND THREE OF THE STRONGEST MAGPIE FRIENDS WERE TO EACH GRAB HOLD OF A CORNER OF THE ROCKET SHIP <unk> THEY COULD FLY TO THE MOON SO THEY TRIED ONE TWO THREE TO THE MOON
THEY SAID TOGETHER PULLING WITH ALL THEIR MIGHT I SEE YOUR WINGS FLAPPING BUT WE DON'T SEEM TO BE GOING ANYWHERE SAID YIN YIN
HMM HEAVIER THAN I THOUGHT I THINK WE BETTER I THINK WE'LL NEED MORE MAGPIES SAID MAGGIE YES BUT HOW ABOUT MANY YES BUT HOW MANY MORE YIN YIN SAID I'M NOT SURE EXACTLY REPLIED MAGGIE
<unk> THE FATHER WATCHED THIS ALL THROUGH ONE EYE FOR HE ALWAYS HAD AT LEAST ONE EYE ASLEEP AT ALL TIMES SAID T'WOULD BE BEST TO ASK THE OWL THEN CLOSED HIS EYE
SIL
SO MAGGIE FLEW TO THE OWL AND ASKED FOR HIS ADVICE
OH WISE OWL I HAVE A QUESTION THAT I FEAR ONLY YOU CAN ANSWER SHE SAID
SIL
HOW TO TURN YOUR HEAD ALL THE WAY AROUND WITHOUT GETTING A TERRIBLE PAIN IN THE NECK SAID OWL
NO HOW MANY MAGPIE'S WOULD BE NEEDED TO FLY A FOUR HUNDRED POUND PANDA BEAR AND A ONE HUNDRED POUND BAMBOO ROCKET SHIP TO THE MOON SAID MAGGIE
THE OWL INSTANTLY REPLIED TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND AND SEVENTY SIX GIVE OR TAKE TWO
A WEEK LATER MAGGIE MANAGED TO ROUND UP TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND AND SEVENTY S EIGHT MAGPIE
SHE COULD BE A VERY PERSUASIVE LITTLE BIRD WHEN SHE WHEN SHE WANT WHEN SHE WANTED
SIL
A WEEK LATER DESPITE MUCH FLAPPING THEY WERE STILL TRYING TO GET THE ROCKET IN THE AIR IT TURNS OUT THAT THE OWL DIDN'T TAKE THE CONSIDERATION THAT ONE
THAT ONCE YOU COULD OVER ONE THOUSAND MAGPIES TOGETHER THEY TEND TO FIGHT AND CAN'T AGREE ON A SINGLE THING
NOW WHILE ALL THIS WAS GOING ON WHAT DO YOU THINK S WHAT DO YOU SUPPOSED FRED WAS DOING
WHY HE WAS FEEDING THE PANDAS LIKE HE WAS SUPPOSED TO
SO ONE DAY AFTER FRED HAD FED THE PAN PANDAS AND HE WAS HUGGING THE PLA PALM TREE THE ZOO MANAGER CAME UP TO HIM AND SAID WHAT IS GOING ON WITH Y YOUR PANDAS FRED I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT
IT'S TAKEN ME A COUPLE OF WEEKS TO FIGURE IT OUT BUT I THINK YIN YIN WANTS TO GO TO THE MOON AND THE MAGPIES WANT TO TAKE HER THERE SAID FRED
OH WELL THAT MAKES SENSE SAID THE MANAGER DID YOU KNOW THAT SINCE THE LITTLE PANDA BUILT THE BAMBOO ROCKET SHIP AND THOSE MAGPIE'S STARTED FLUTTERING ABOUT THAT THE ZOO'S PROFITS HAVE GONE UP FOUR FOUR THOUSAND PERCENT T
THAT IS JUST THE TYPE OF EXPOSURE WE NEEDED THOSE PANDAS WILL BE WITH US FOR A LONG TIME
FRED THOUGHT ABOUT IT AND SAID YOU KNOW I THINK WE SHOULD RENAME YIN YIN COLUMBUS
THE ZOO KEEPER SAID GOOD HEAVENS MAN THAT IS A GREAT IDEA NO WAIT A SECOND I DON'T UNDERSTAND WELL SIR WHEN COLUMBUS SET OUT ON HIS SHIP HE WAS REALLY TRYING TO FIND
A QUICKER WAY TO GET TO GET AROUND EUROPE IN ORDER TO IMPROVE TRADE
HE WANTED TO BE A BUSINESS MAN BUT INSTEAD BECAME A GREAT EXPLORER
YES BUT WHAT DOES THAT HAVE TO DO WITH PANDAS MAN
PANDAS MAN SAID THE ZOO MANAGER WELL IT SEEMS TO ME SIR THAT YIN YIN WANTED TO BE A GREAT EXPLORER INSTEAD BECAME A BUSINESS WOMAN
I SEE FRED ONE MORE THING SIR ABOUT THOSE MAGPIES FLYING ABOVE THE PANDAS DO YOU THINK THAT THE ZOO COULD PURCHASE M ME A LARGE SIZE SIZED UMBRELLA
THE ZOO MANAGER LAUGHED AND WALKED AWAY BUT DID PURCHASE A FASHIONABLE YELLOW UMBRELLA FOR FRED THE NEXT DAY
BACK IN THE PANDA'S HOME THE MOON PANDA MOTHER PANDA <unk> POO POO WAS VERY PROUD OF HER DAUGHTER
AFTER ALL IF IT WEREN'T FOR YIN YIN THEY WOULD HAVE HAD TO MOVE FOR THEIR WONDERFUL HOME FROM THEIR WONDERFUL HOME
BUT LATER WHEN FRED WALKED INTO THE PANDA'S HOME UNDER A HIS NEW YELLOW UMBRELLA ALL SHE COULD THINK TO SAY WAS NONSENSE
AS FOR YIN YIN SHE WAS VERY PROUD TO RE TO BE RENAMED AFTER A FAMOUS EXPLORER AND SHE AND MAGGIE NEVER STOPPED TRYING TO GET TO THE MOON
I THINK ITS PRETTY INTERESTING <unk> <br> OKAY SO THERE WAS A PANDA NAMED YIN YIN AND HE HAS A FRIEND THAT'S A MAGPIE NAMED MAGGIE AND
SIL
SINCE THE ZOO WASN'T VERY POPULAR <br> THE MAGPIE TOLD HIM ABOUT THE MOON AND SO YIN YIN WANTED TO GO THERE AND SO THEY TRIED TO MAKE A ROCKETSHIP AND THEN THE ZOO BECAME POPULAR AND I'M CONFUSED ABOUT THE UMBRELLA
SIL
FRED HE LIKES PANDAS AND HE SAID WHEN YOU GET THREE FEET LIKE CLOSE
THREE FEET APART FROM THEM YOU HAVE LIKE THIS URGE TO HUG THEM
SIL
AND HE HAS LIKE LOTS OF BIG RELATIONSHIP WITH YIN YIN AND THE MAGPIES
SIL
WELL THEY DECIDED TO CHANGE IT BECAUSE <br> SHE WANTED TO BECOME A GREAT EXPLORER LIKE CHRISTOPHER COLUMBUS
BUT SHE BUT THEN SHE JUST BECAME A BUSINESS WOMAN SO THEY IT WAS KIND OF LIKE THE OPPOSITE SO THEY MUST HAVE THOUGHT LIKE CHRISTOPHER COLUMBUS
SIL
THEY SHOOK THE FLOUR OFF HER AND SET HER DOWN ON THE KITCHEN FLOOR
I BEG YOUR PARDON SAID THE LEARNED MAN IT'S AN OLD HABIT WITH ME
SIL
SHE SAW THAT SHE WAS ON ON THE GRASS AND THE BROKEN WHEEL BESIDE HER
SIL
KNOW THEN THAT IF I TELL YOU THE REASON I SHALL INSTANTLY DIE
SIL
AYE I KNOW SAID THE DAME GENTLY FEARING TO INTERRUPT THE STORY
YOU CERTAINLY ARE AN ABLE MINDED YOUNGSTER HIRAM <unk> HIRAM HE OBSERVED
SIL
AND STILL SHE SAT AND STILL SHE REELED AND STILL SHE WISHED FOR WISHED FOR COMPANY
SIL

SIL
ROOSTER JOHN
SIL
THEIR PROBLEMS STARTED WITH WHEN THEY RAN OUT OF WATER
THANKFULLY SOMEONE WAS DIGGING A HOLE AND FOUND WATER
BUT SOON AFTER THAT THEY STARTED TO GET FLIES THEY GOT TONS AND TONS OF FLIES
THEN THE FLIES STOPPED BUT JUST THEN A MAN MOVED INTO TOWN WHO PLAYED THE FLUTE SO BADLY THAT PEOPLE WOULD RUN AWAY SCREAMING
MAYBE A POORLY PLAYED FLUTE DOESN'T SOUND ALL THAT BAD BUT JUST TRY TO IMAGINE SOMEONE SCRATCHING A CHALKBOARD WITH A FORK AND THEN MULTIPLY THE TIMES A HUNDRED
THAT'S HOW THE FLUTE SOUNDED WHEN THE GUY PLAYED IT
I'M SERIOUS STILL IT'S NOT AS BAD AS MILLIONS OF FLIES I SUPPOSE
SIL
THE BAD FLUTE PLAYER WAS ROOSTER JOHN HE WASN'T CALLED ROOSTER JOHN YET THAT CAME AFTER
HE WAS THE NEW TOWN DENTIST HE WAS AN EXCELLENT DENTIST
SIL
EXCELLENT DENTIST HE WAS REAL
BUT HIS REAL LOVE WAS MUSIC HE PLAYED MANY MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS SUCH AS THE CAR THE GUITAR THE TUBA THE PIANO AND THE CLARINET
HOWEVER FOR SOME REASON THE WAY HIS MOUTH WAS SHAPED MADE HIS FLUTE SOUND AWFUL
SIL
WE CAN'T LET YOU PLAY THE FLUTE ANYMORE JOHN SAID POLICE CHEF SANDERS
THE NEIGHBORS ARE COMPLAINING AND THE CATS AND DOGS ARE TRYING TO CHEW OFF THEIR EARS
BUT I HAVE TO PLAY I WAS BORN TO DO IT I DON'T KNOW WHY BUT I FEEL LIKE I HAVE TO OR ELSE BAD THINGS WILL HAPPEN
LOOK JOHN I'VE HEARD YOU PLAY THE CLARINET YOU'RE QUITE GOOD WHY DON'T YOU PLAY THAT INSTEAD SAID JEFF SANDERS CHIEF SANDERS
SIL
OH THAT'S A NICE INSTRUMENT BUT IT'S JUST NOT THE FLUTE I EVEN WROTE YOU A SONG CHIEF SANDERS IT'S CALLED COPS AND ROBBERS
THEN HE PLAYED THE SONG THE POLICE
SIL
CHEF
SIL
CHIEF HATED THE SOUND SO MUCH THAT HE THREW JOHN IN JAIL
BUT THEY COULDN'T KEEP JOHN IN JAIL SINCE HE WAS REALLY BREAKING ANY LAWS SO THERE WAS NOTHING THE POLICE COULD DO
BESIDES EVERYBODY LOVED JOHN SINCE HE HAD BECOME THE TOWN DE DENTIST EVERYBODY'S TEETH WERE MUCH WHITER AND CLEANER AND NO ONE HAD ANY CAVITIES
SIL
WHAT SHOULD THEY DO
SIL
THEY COULD KEEP JOHN IN JAIL AND THEY DIDN'T WANT TO KICK HIM OUT OF TOWN BECAUSE THEY ALL HAD SUCH NICE TEETH
SO THEY DECIDED THAT JOHN COULD PLAY THE FLUTE AND EVERYBODY ELSE WOULD HAVE TO WEAR EARPLUGS
SIL
WELL I AM SURE YOU GUESSED THAT DIDN'T WORK
NO ONE COULD HEAR ANYTHING PEOPLE WERE GETTING INTO CAR ACCIDENTS AND EVERYBODY LOOKED REALLY SILLY AT DANCES
DANCING TO MUSIC THEY COULDN'T EVEN HEAR <unk> THEY JUST COULDN'T LED A NOR LIVE LEAD A NORMAL LIFE
THEN THEY DECIDED TO LOWER HIM DOWN A WELL AND LET HIM PLAY DOWN WHERE NO ONE COULD HEAR HIM
JUST THOUGH THAT WAS AN OK JOHN THOUGHT THAT WAS AN OK IDEA BUT THERE WAS AN ECHO IN THE WELL THAT MADE THE FLUTE SOUND LOUDER
SIL
WINDOWS WERE BREAKING AND ALL THE COWS IN TOWN STARTED TO MAKE
SIL
SOUR MILK THE LOCAL SCIENTIST DOCTOR WONG
SIL
CAME UP WITH AN IDEA HE THOUGHT THAT IF HE MADE A NEW MOUTHPIECE ESPECIALLY SHAPED FOR JOHN'S MOUTH THEN PERHAPS HE COULD PLAY THE FLUTE NORMALLY
SIL
AND GUESS WHAT IT WORKED DOCTOR WONG WAS THE TOWN HERO THE FLUTE SOUNDED NORMAL AND IT TURNED OUT JOHN COULD PLAY IT QUITE WELL
SIL
DOCTOR WONG AND JOHN
SIL
WERE THE STARS OF THE PARADE THEY WERE UP ON THE MAIN FLOAT BIG BAND PLAYED AS THEY MARCHED UP AND DOWN MAIN STREET EVERYONE CHEERED THEN SUDDENLY A FLY LANDED ON A LITTLE GIRL
THEN A FLY LANDED ON SOMEONE ELSE THEN SOME LANDED ON A BUNCH OF PEOPLE
THEN PRETTY SOON TONS OF FLIES WERE LANDING ON EVERYONE BEFORE THEY KNEW IT THE TOWN WAS FILLED WITH FLIES AGAIN
SIL
OH NO SAID
SIL
JOHN DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO SO HE JUST KEPT ON PLAYING HIS FLUTE THE FLIES WERE ANNOYING SO HE WOULD S SWEET SWEAT AT THEM WITH HIS HAND OR EVEN HIS NEW FLUTE
HE STARTED SHAKING THE FLUTE TO GET THE FLIES OFF THE OFF AND ACCIDENTALLY SMASHED IT INTO PIECES
HE WAS VERY UPSET AT FIRST THEN HE SAID OH WELL GOOD THING I BROUGHT MY OLD FLUTE AS BACK UP
NO NO PLEASE DON'T PLAY YOUR OLD FLUTE DOCTOR BEGAN BEGGED DOCTOR WONG BUT IT WAS TOO LATE JOHN HAD STARTED PLAYING
WHEN THE TOWNSFOLKS HEARD THE NOISE THEY COULDN'T EVEN SWAT AT THE FLIES ANYMORE
THEN THEY HAD TO COVER THEIR EARS FROM THE HORRIBLE SOUND
THE FLIES WOULD LAND ALL OVER THE PEOPLE AND THEY C COULDN'T SWIPE AT THEM THEM OFF
IT WAS GROSS THEN SUDDENLY THE FLIES FLEW AWAY FAST AS THEY COULD
DOCTOR WONG THOUGHT FOR A SECOND THAT
SIL
PRONOUN PRONOUNCED
SIL
IT'S THE FLUTE SOUND THE FLIES HATE JOHN'S FLUTE PLAYING AS MUCH AS WE DO
JOHN THE DENTIST IS DRIVING THE FLIES AWAY
AS BAD AS THE FLUTE SOUNDED IT WAS A LOT BETTER THAN THOUSANDS OF FLIES CRAWLING ON THEM
FROM THEN ON JOHN WOULD WAKE UP AT SUNRISE LIKE A ROOSTER AND PLAY TO KEEP THE FLIES AWAY
IT WAS ABOUT
SIL
THIS GUY NAMED JOHN WHO CAME INTO THE TOWN AND PLAYED A FLUTE BUT IT SOUNDED REALLY AWFUL
SIL
AND THE TOWNSPEOPLE COULDN'T TAKE IT ANYMORE SO THEY TRIED A LOT OF DIFFERENT IDEAS BUT NONE OF THEM REALLY WORKED
AND THEN THIS GUY NAMED DOCTOR WONG HAD AN IDEA THAT THEY WOULD MAKE A NEW MOUTHPIECE FOR JOHN AND IT WORKED AND HIS
SIL
THE FLUTE BEGAN TO PLAY BETTER WELL HE PLAYED BETTER WITH THE FLUTE AND SO THEY HAD A BIG PARADE FOR HIM AND DOCTOR WONG BUT THE FLIES CAME AND LANDED ON EVERYBODY
SIL

WOULD I WOULD LIKE TO START BY SAYING I THINK YOU ARE VERY MEAN A VERY MEAN TO ME
I COULDN'T HELP IT I COULDN'T HELP IT ANYWAY IT WAS AN ACCIDENT AND I DIDN'T EVEN DO IT ON PURPOSE
I REALLY DIDN'T MEAN TO
SIL
I DIDN'T REALLY MEAN TO SHAVE THE CAT REALLY I SWEAR OK HERE'S WHAT HAPPENED AS I REMEMBER IT
I SAW THAT THE CAT WAS TRYING TO GET THE GERBILS AND YOU TOLD TOLD US WE COULDN'T HIT THE ANIMALS SO I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT ELSE TO DO SO I
GRABBED DAD'S I GRABBED DAD'S NOSE HAIR CLIPPERS AND SHAVED IT
YOU SHOULDN'T BE PROUD OF ME YOU SHOULDN'T BE PROUD OF ME FOR THINKING SO FAST ON MY TOES
OH SURE IT'S EASY TO SAY THAT I COULD HAVE JUST PICKED THE CAT UP BUT SOMETIMES WE DON'T ALWAYS THINK ALL THE GREAT UNDER PRESSURE YOU AND DO YOU AND DO YOU KNOW WHAT
UHM THOSE STUPID GERBILS DIDN'T EVEN THANK ME THEY JUST RAN ON THE STUPID WHEEL AND DIDN'T AND DID STUPID THINGS
THAT THAT'S THE LEAST THAT'S THE LAST TIME I SHAVE THE CAT TO PROTECT ANY STUPID GERBILS
BESIDES THE REAL REASON I SHAVED THE CAT WAS TO KEEP IT NICE AND COOL <unk> I JUST DIDN'T WANT TO SEE THE CAT GETTING ALL HOT AND UNCOMFORTABLE AND STUFF
<br> YOU GUYS WILL PROBABLY JUST SAY IT'S WINTER DAN JUST IT'S JUST WINTER DANNY CATS DON'T OVERHEAT IN WINTER
BUT SO WHAT IF IT'S WINTER I MEAN THE SUMMER IS SOON ENOUGH AND I JUST WANTED TO <unk> THE CAT TO GET USED TO THE IDEA BEFORE I GOT REALLY HOT
PLUS OSCAR MY TURTLE TOLD ME TO SHAVE THE CAT
FINE OSCAR CAN'T REALLY TALK BUT IF H IF HE COULD HE WOULD HAVE HAD SAID
PLEASE SHAVE THE CAT IT'S H ITS KEEPS HITTING ME ON THE SHELL TRYING TO ROLL ME OVER WHEN YOU LEAVE WHEN YOU LEAVE THE ROOM
YOU GUYS NEVER LIKED OSCAR AS MUCH AS THE CAT ANYWAY
<br> YOU WOULDN'T ALWAYS T YOU WOULDN'T ALWAY YOU WOULDN'T ALWAYS TAKE THE CAT'S SIDE IF YOU KNEW THE STUFF TO DO MY POOR HURDLE TO DO MY POOR TURTLE
CAT'S AREN'T ALWAYS NICE JUST LIKE MY SISTER JENNY ISN'T ALWAYS NICE BUT THE REALEST REASON I SHAVED THE CAT WAS TO MAKE A WIG FOR THOSE POOR HAIRLESS
SIL
I KNEW OUR CAT WOULD GROW F HER FUR BLACK BACK <unk> BUT SOME CATS DIDN'T HAVE HAIR DON'T HAVE HAIR THEY ARE CALLED HAIRLESS CATS
AND THEY NEED FUR IN IN THE WINTER SOMETIMES I THINK
<unk> I SWEAR THAT THAT'S THE REASON I ALSO WANT I ALSO WAS GOING TO SELL THE CAT
SELL THE C SELL THE CAT FUR AND BUY MY SISTER JENNY BRACES FOR HER <unk> BIG STUPID FACE
PLUS I FORGOT TO TELL YOU THAT I YOU SHOULD BE BLAMING MRS CAT CAPS CASPER MY SCIENCE TEACHER
SHE MADE US SHAVE SOMETHING FOR SCIENCE ASK HER SHE SAID THAT WHEN WE SHAVE HAIR IT GROWS BACK BACK HARDER AND SOMETIMES EVEN DARKER
SO I THOUGHT THAT IF I COULD SHAVE THE CAT A BUNCH OF TIMES HER HAIR WOULD GROW BLACK HER HAIR WILL GR GROW BACK HARDER EACH TIME AND SOON SHE WOULD H HAVE AN INVINCIBLE COAT OF CAT FUR ARMOR
<unk> THEN SHE WOULD BE A SUPER CAT
SIL
AND YOU COULD TAKE HER ON TV SHOWS AND LET GET LOTS OF MONEY
SO THAT SO THAT YOU CAN SEE JENNY TO GO TO COLLEGE AND IT'S IT'S A DUMB LITTLE TATTLE'TALE
SHE'S GOOD AT SCHOOL AND YOU BOUGHT HER A CAT BECAUSE SHE'S SO RESPONSIBLE AND STUFF
JUST CAUSE SHE'S A GOOD STUDENT DOESN'T MEAN THAT SHE REALLY SHE'S REALLY RESPONSIBLE LAST NIGHT I SAW THAT SHE DIDN'T BRUSH HER TEETH <unk>
OH YEAH I FORGOT TO TELL YOU THAT
DEAR MOM AND DAD JENNY DIDN'T BRUSH HER TEETH LAST NIGHT
I THINK THAT SHE SHOULD BRUSH HER TEETH TWICE TONIGHT
THAT'S JUST MY OPINION THOUGH I I'LL BET YOU DIDN'T EVEN
I BET I'LL BET YOU DIDN'T KNOW SOMETHING ELSE YOU KNOW THAT I WANTED TO BE A BARBER
I WAS AFRAID TO TELL YOU THE REAL REASON I SHAVED THE CAT
THAT WAS WHY THAT W THAT WAS WHAT THAT WAS THAT I WANTED TO BE A BARBER AND I NEEDED PRACTICE
I WAS AFRAID YOU WOULDN'T LET ME PRACTICE MY OWN ON MY OWN HEAD CAN I
CAN I PRACTICE SHAVING JENNY'S HEAD I PROMISE THAT I'LL DO A BETTER JOB THEN I DID ON THE CAT CAUSE NOW I HAVE DAD DAD NOW I HAVE WHAT DAD CALLS LIFE EXPERIENCE
NOT THAT I SHAVED THE CAT THOUGH NOT THAT I SHAVED THE CAT THOUGH
<unk> ACTUALLY THE TRUTH IS THAT BUT BY ACCIDENTALLY BY ACCIDENT TURNED THE NOSE HAIR CLIPPERS
AND THE CAT WAS BEING CH THE CAT WAS BEING CHASED BY THE TURTLE AND RAN RIGHT BY THE CRIPPLES AND IT SHA CL CLIPPERS AND IT SHAVED SHAVED ITSELF
IF I HAD THE C IF I HAD A IF I HAD A CAT <unk> I WOULD TEACH IT NOT TO SHAVE ITSELF THAT'S FOR SURE
I DON'T HAVE TO GET A GOOD I DON'T HAVE TO GET GOOD GRADES TO KNOW THAT YOU SHOULD TEACH A CAT HOW TO SHAVE ITSELF
PLUS IF YOU WEREN'T ALWAYS CUDDLING WITH MY SISTER SO MUCH AS SO MUCH MAYBE YOU WOULD HAVE BEEN WITH HER CAT INSTEAD INSTEAD THE CAT CAME INTO MY ROOM BECAUSE JENNY NEVER PLAYS WITH IT
SIL
ENOUGH NEVER PLAYS WITH IT ENOUGH THE CAT LIKED BEING SHAVED ANYWAY SO I DIDN'T SEE THE BIG DEAL
I DIDN'T SO I DON'T SEE THE BIG DEAL
I DIDN'T IT I DON'T I THINK IT REALLY I THINK IT REALLY LIKED ITS HAIRCUT ONLY THE REASON IT HASN'T COME OUT FOR TWO WEEKS IS BECAUSE YOU GUYS MADE SUCH A BIG DEAL ABOUT IT POOR KITTY
AND THIS AND THIS AND POOR KITTY THAT IF IT'S YOUR FAULT REALLY DAD PLEASE DON'T READ THE NEXT PART
DEAR MOM DON'T LET DEAR MOM DON'T LET DAD KNOW THE REAL REASON I SHAVED THE CAT <unk>
I SHAVED THE CAT WAS HE ALWAYS SNEEZING A SNEEZING AROUND IT
I KNOW HOW MUCH YOU HATE HIM ALWAYS SNEEZING AND STUFF SO I
SIL
SO I THOUGHT IF I GOT RID OF ITS FUR HE WOULDN'T SNEEZE
AND THEN YOU WOULD HAVE A BETTER MARRIAGE
SO IT REALLY IT'S REALLY MY F IT REALLY FATHER'S DAY GIFT IT'S REALLY MY FATHER'S DAY GIFT TO HIM I COULDN'T BUY HIM ANYTHING NICE SINCE YOU TOOK AWAY MY ALLOWANCE FOR WHEN I SHAVED THE NEIGHBOR'S DOG
<br> HOW COME JENNY GETS A CAT AND I GET A STUPID TURTLE ANYWAY
TURTLES DON'T DO ANYTHING EXCEPT THEIR STICK THEIR POKED STICK THEIR HEADS OUT OF STICK THEIR HEADS OUT AND NOT BE NOT AND BE NOT CUDDLY
CAN I GET A DOG PLEASE
SO CONCLUSION I'M GETTING HUNGRY AND I'M SORRY FOR SHAVING THE CAT ALTHOUGH YOU CAN SEE IT'S REALLY JENNY'S FAULT FOR NOT BEING AS RESPONSIBLE AS YOU ALWAYS SAY SH AND NOT YOU ALWAYS SAY ALWAYS SAY AND NOT BRUSHING HER TEETH
P S IF YOU WOULD HAVE BOUGHT HER A TURTLE I COULDN'T HAVE SHAVED IT

OF COURSE IF PRISSY HAD HAD A SPARK OF SPIRIT SHE WOULDN'T HAVE GIVEN IN
ISN'T HE KNOWN AS THE MOST BRILLIANT JOURNALIST OF IN NEW YORK
WHY I'M HARDLY ACQUAINTED WITH YOU CRIED ANNE INDIGNANTLY OOPS <unk>
I SWORE TO BRING YOU THE TERRIBLE HEAD AND SEE HOW I KEPT MY OATH
ALL NIGHT THE BLIZZARD RAGED AND IN THE MORNING THE PLAINS WERE WHITE WITH SNOW
NOW ALL THE PEOPLE REJOICED BECAUSE THE WICKED KING SHOULD RULE THEM NO LONGER
GRACIOUS AIN'T THAT AN AWFUL LOT OF MONEY EXCLAIMED DAVY CROCKETT
THIS LITTLE JOHN DID ALTHOUGH WITHOUT DISTURBING HIS MASTER OR RISING FROM WHERE HE SAT
THE NEXT MOMENT HE CHANGED THE SUBJECT BECAUSE IT SEEMED THE BEST THING TO DO
DEAR MOM AND DAD PARENTS
SINCE YOU HAVE GROUNDED ME AND TOLD ME TO WRITE DOWN WHY I AM SORRY BEFORE I WAS ALLOWED OUT OF MY ROOM I AM MAD AT YOU
I WOULD LIKE TO START BY SAYING THAT I THINK THAT YOU ARE VERY MEAN TO M MAKE ME DO THIS BECAUSE IT WASN'T EVEN MY FAULT
I COULDN'T HELP IT ANYWAY
IT WAS AN ACCIDENT AND I DIDN'T EVEN DO IT ON PURPOSE
I REALLY DIDN'T MEAN TO SHAVE THE CAT REALLY I SWEAR
OK HERE'S WHAT HAPPENED AS I REMEMBER IT
I SAW THAT THE CAT WAS TRYING TO GET THE GERBILS AND YOU TOLD US WE COULDN'T HIT ANIMALS SO I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT ELSE TO DO
SO I GRABBED DAD'S NOSE HAIR CLIPPERS AND SHAVED IT
YOU SHOULD BE PROUD OF ME FOR THINKING SO FAST ON MY TOES
OH SURE IT'S EASY TO SAY THAT I SHOULD HAVE PICKED JUST PICKED UP THE CAT
BUT SOMETIMES WE DON'T ALWAYS THINK ALL THAT GREAT UNDER PRESSURE
AND YOU KNOW WHAT THOSE STUPID GERBILS DIDN'T EVEN THANK ME
THEY JUST RAN ON THAT STUPID WHEEL AND DIDN'T AND DID STUPID THINGS THAT'S THE LAST TIME I SHAVE THE CAT TO PROTECT ANY STUPID GERBILS
BESIDES THE REAL REASON I SHAVED THE CAT WAS TO KEEP IT NICE AND COOL
I I JUST DIDN'T WANT TO SEE THE CAT GETTING ALL HOT AND UNCOMFORTABLE AND STUFF
<br> YOU GUYS WILL JUST PROBABLY SAY IT'S DINNER DANNY CATS IT'S WINTER DANNY CATS DON'T OVERHEAT IN WINTER
BUT SO WHAT IF IT'S WINTER I MEAN IT'LL BE SUMMER SOON ENOUGH AND I JUST WANTED THAT CAT TO GET USED TO THE IDEA BEFORE IT GOT REALLY HOT
PLUS OSCAR MY TURTLE TOLD ME TO SHAVE THE CAT
FINE OSCAR CAN'T REALLY TALK BUT IF HE COULD HE WOULD HAVE SAID PLEASE SHAVE THE CAT
IT KEEPS HITTING ME ON THE SHELL AND TRYING TO ROLL ME OVER AND WHEN YOU LEAVE THE ROOM YOU
SIL
AND WHEN YOU LEAVE THE ROOM
YOU GUYS NEVER LIKED OSCAR AS MUCH AS THE CAT ANYWAY
YOU WOULDN'T ALWAYS TAKE THE CAT'S SIDE IF YOU KNEW THAT IF YOU KNEW THE STUFF HE HID DID TO MY POOR TURTLE CAT'S AREN'T ALWAYS NICE JUST LIKE MY SISTER JENNY ISN'T ALWAYS NICE
BUT THE REALEST REASON I I SHAVED THE CAT WAS TO MAKE A WIG FOR THOSE POOR HAIR LESS CATS THAT WE SAW ON TV ON THE ANIMAL CHANNEL
I KNEW OUR CAT WOULD GROW HER FUR BACK BUT SOME CATS DON'T HAVE HAIR
THEY ARE CALLED HAIRLESS CATS AND THEY NEED FUR IN THE WINTER SOMETIMES I THINK
I SWEAR THAT'S THE REASON ALSO I WAS GOING TO SELL THE CAT FUR AND BUY MY SISTER JENNY BRACES FOR HER BIG STUPID FACE
PLUS I FORGOT TO TELL YOU THAT YOU SHOULD BE BLAMING MRS CASPER MY SCIENCE TEACHER SHE MADE US SHAVE SOMETHING FOR SCIENCE ASK HER
SHE SAID THAT WHEN WE SHAVE HAIR IT GROWS BACK HARDER AND SOMETIMES EVEN DARKER
SO I THOUGHT THAT IF I COULD SHAVE THE CAT A LOT OF A LOT OF BUNCH OF TIMES HER HAIR WOULD GROW BACK HARDER EACH TIME AND SOON SHE WOULD HAVE AN IN INVINCIBLE COAT OF CAT FUR ARMOR
THEN SHE WOULD BE A SUPER CAT AND YOU COULD TAKE HER ON TV SHOWS AND GET LOTS OF MONEY SO THAT YOU CAN SEND JENNY TO COLLEGE EVEN IF SHE IS A DUMB LITTLE TATTLE'TALE
SHE'S NO GOOD AT SCHOOL AND YOU BOUGHT HER A CAT CAUSE SHE'S SO RESPONSIBLE AND STUFF
SIL
JUST CAUSE SHE'S A GOOD STUDENT DOESN'T MEAN SHE'S REALLY RESPONSIBLE
LAST NIGHT I SAW THAT SHE DIDN'T BRUSH HER TEETH OH YEAH I FORGOT TO TELL YOU THAT
DEAR MOM AND DAD JENNY DIDN'T BRUSH HER TEETH LAST NIGHT
I THINK THAT SHE SHOULD BRUSH HER TEETH TWICE TONIGHT THAT'S JUST MY OPINION THOUGH
I'LL BET YOU DIDN'T KNOW SOMETHING ELSE DID YOU KNOW THAT I WANTED TO BE A BARBER
I WAS AFRAID TO TELL YOU THE REAL REASON I SHAVED THE CAT WAS THAT I WANT TO BE A BARBER AND I NEEDED PRACTICE
I WAS AFRAID YOU WOULDN'T LET ME PRACTICE ON MY OWN HEAD CAN I PRACTICE BY SHAVING JENNY'S HEAD
I PROMISE THAT I'LL DO A BETTER JOB THEN I DID ON THE CAT CAUSE NOW I HAVE WHAT DAD CALLS LIFE EXPERIENCE
NOT THAT I SHAVED THE CAT THOUGH
ACTUALLY THE T TRUTH IS THAT I BY ACCIDENT TURNED ON THE NOSE HAIR CLIPPERS AND THE CAT WAS BEING CHASED BY THE TURTLE
RAN RIGHT BY THE CLIPPERS AND SHAVED HERSELF I KEPT SAYING NO KITTY NO DON'T SHAVE YOURSELF
BUT MY STUPID SISTER NEVER TAUGHT HER CAT HOW TO LISTEN SO SHE JUST IGNORED ME
SEE SHE'S S NOT SO RESPONSIBLE AFTER ALL
IF I HAD A CAT I WOULD TEACH IT TO NOT SHAVE ITSELF THAT'S FOR SURE
I DIDN'T HAVE TO GET GOOD GRADES TO KNOW THAT YOU SHOULDN'T TEACH A CAT TO SHAVE ITSELF
<br> PLUS IF YOU WEREN'T ALWAYS CUDDLING WITH MY SISTER SO MUCH MAYBE SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN WITH HER CAT
INSTEAD THE CAT CAME INTO MY ROOM BECAUSE JENNY NEVER PLAYS WITH IT ENOUGH
THE CAT LIKED BEING SHAVED ANYWAY SO I DON'T SEE THE BIG DEAL
I THINK IT REALLY LIKES LIKED IT ITS HAIRCUT THE ONLY REASON IT HASN'T COME OUT FOR TWO WEEKS IS BECAUSE YOU GUYS MADE SUCH A BIG DEAL ABOUT IT POOR KITTY THIS AND POOR KITTY THAT IT'S YOUR FAULT REALLY
DAD PLEASE DON'T READ THE NEXT PART
DEAR MOM DON'T LET DAD KNOW THAT THE REAL SH REASON I SHAVED THE CAT WAS THAT HE'S ALWAYS SNEEZING AROUND
I KNOW HOW MUCH YOU HATE HIM ALWAYS SNEEZING AND STUFF SO I THOUGHT IF I GET GOT RID OF HIS FUR HE WOULDN'T SNEEZE AND THAT YOU WOULD HAVE A BETTER MARRIAGE
SO IT REALLY SO IT WAS REALLY MY FATHER'S DAY GIFT TO HIM I COULDN'T BUY HIM ANYTHING NICE SINCE YOU TOOK AWAY MY ALLOWANCE FOR WHEN I SHAVED THE NEIGHBOR'S DOG
<unk> HOW COME JENNY GETS A CAT AND I GET A STUPID TURTLE ANYWAY TURTLES DON'T DO ANYTHING EXCEPT POKE THEIR HEADS OUT AND BE NOT CUDDLY
CAN I GET A DOG PLEASE SO IN CONCLUSION I'M GETTING HUNGRY AND I'M SORRY FOR SHAVING THE CAT ALTHOUGH YOU CAN SEE THAT IT'S REALLY JENNY'S FAULT FOR NOT BEING AS RESPONSIBLE AS YOU ALWAYS SAY AND NOT BRUSHING HER TEETH
P S IF YOU WOULD HAVE BOUGHT HER A TURTLE I COULDN'T H HAVE SHAVED IT SINCERELY DANNY
HE SHAVED HIS CAT OR HIS SISTER'S CAT BECAUSE UHM
<br>
HE DIDN'T REALLY
SIL
LIKE IT THAT MUCH AND ALSO I HE THOUGHT IT WOULD LIKE IT BEING SHAVED UHM
BUT HE'S JUST TRYING TO MAKE UP EXCUSES BECAUSE HE DOESN'T WANT TO GET IN TROUBLE WITH HIS PARENTS
SIL
AND HE'S JUST TRYING TO GET HIS SISTER IN TROUBLE AND CAUSE UHM HER HIS PARENTS THINK HE'S SHE'S ALL RESPONSIBLE
AND HE WANTS TO BE THE RESPONSIBLE ONE FOR ONCE
SIL
SO
SIL
AND THINKS HE DID THE RIGHT THING BUT HIS PARENTS DON'T THINK THAT <br>
SIL
HE WANTED TO BE A BARBER
SIL
AND HE THOUGHT THE CAT UHM NEEDED LIKE A COAT LIKE CAUSE IT WAS SUMMER SO ER IT IT WAS WINTER BUT HE THOUGHT THAT HE NEEDED TO HAVE A COAT FOR THE SUMMER SO HE SHAVED IT
AND UHM BECAUSE IN SCIENCE CLASS THEY SHAVED SOMETHING AND HIS TEACHER
SIL
TOLD HIM THAT IT WAS OKAY I GUESS AND YEAH
