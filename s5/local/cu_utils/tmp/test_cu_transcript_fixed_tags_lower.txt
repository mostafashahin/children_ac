i asked mom and dad for a brother or sister i want someone to play with
i told them they bought luis
home from the hospital he was just a baby he couldn't do anything
can we trade him in
i asked of course we can't trade him in he is your
he is your brother they said
now luis is six months old he ca
he can't do much he's not much fun
my cat had kittens the kittens can run jump and climb they are lots of fun they are only three months old they are younger than luis
all luis does is sleep
well sometimes he cries he
he eats a lot too
how long does it take a baby to grow i asked
the kittens are y long are younger than luis they can't do many things luis has a problem
he can't do anything
look at your kittens
mom said
they are almost as big as their mother but people take longer to grow than kittens do
soon luis will be able to do things soon he will be more fun
mom took some picture from a box some pictures from a box
they were baby pictures
mom said once you were as small as luis see how much you have grown in six years
then luis started to cry
lunch time said mom you and luis need lots of good food
that gave me an idea
maybe luis wasn't growing fast because he didn't eat the right food kittens in
eat kitten food they grow very fast
maybe if mom fed luis kitten food he'd grow fast
too
mom didn't like that idea kitten food is for kittens she told me you and lui
you and luis need
people
food to grow
you need
food
from each of the four food groups what are the four food groups mom i asked one group is dairy foods like milk and cheese a second group is meats like chicken and fish
eggs and nuts are in the meat group
too a third group is bread
breads and cereals the fourth group is fruits and vegetables
i thought about
the problem with luis luis maybe he did not eat enough he could never grow just eating baby food
luis should eat some the same foods that i eat maybe he would grow
faster
i said he can't eat the food you eat mom said he only has two teeth he can't chew well i didn't think of that luis has only
two
teeth it can't be fun being a baby even for luis i all the things that make me grow
i like the foods i eat maybe the problem with luis is that he's a baby he can't do anything about it soon he'll grow then he'll be a real
a real kid just like me until then i'll play with the kittens
right now
luis wi ah uhm
what's that boys name
the brother wanted a br
a brother or a sister so he got
a brother
but he was a baby and
and he wasn't much fun because he'd do he couldn't do much all he'd could do was sleep eat and cry
he brother wasn't very happy about that
he thought that luis wasn't
growing fast because he wasn't eating the right food
his he thought that kittens
growth was
normal for
for every species
but it wasn't
you can come
hunt with me today said father fox to his son you are ready to find your own food thank you father said the son his name was ray and he thought he was very smart
but i think i can go by myself no ray you are not grown up yet i have to teach you first do not go without me said father fox
next
ray said nothing but when his father was asleep the next day
he went out he came back with a big fat turkey he woke his father with a bark look at what i found i do not need to go with you
you do not know what you need said father fox a smart fox will never go out in daytime but ray did not listen to his father he went out every day he got lots of chickens turkeys and ducks soon people were trying to catch him
one night father fox went out alone but ray followed him he stopped quickly on the path
he waited for a second and then ran on ray went after him he stopped at the same place what is this ray said a chicken just sitting in the grass my father must be going blind i won't let this prize get away
he jumped out
onto the chicken
the trap went snap and ray was caught what a fool i am he said i only saw the bait but my father saw the trap
we make cool shade on the green grass said the flapping leaves
we dress the tree
in fresh and quiet green it is bare and brown without us
tired people and hot animals are happy for our shade children love to play under us
at night the song birds of the woods fly to us for our safety we hide the nests of mother birds
the light winds stay with us and play with us and the leaves felt very proud and important
what you say is all very true but you should not forget us said a voice from the earth we are surely worth something
and who are you where do you grow asked the leaves we are deep in the ground far below you
but we feed the stems and make you grow
we are the roots you owe your beauty to us we are not pretty like you but y
but we do not die
winter does not change us but when it comes you fall the tree stands firm we hold it in place if we died the tree would die and you would die with it
uhm this fox
he thinks he's really smart
and
he keeps on going hu he doesn't think he needs to go with his father
but
he goes and uhm
the fox
he just goes and catches a lot of things and then people
are trying to catch him
and then his father goes out hunting and he follows him
and then he thought he saw the bait
and then he went in and the trap fell over him
uhm the leaves they think they're really good and they're really proud of themselves
they think like they're the best but the roots
uhm
like
they think they're the best
and the roots
they all talk about themselves
and
the frog the frog the mouse illustrated by jack
beek
one day a frog was out walking he saw a mouse
there is a silly mouse he said
i i will play a joke on him it will be fun good morning little mouse
how are you today said the mouse i am fine said the mouse how are you
i don't feel
good today so i
am out walking will you walk with me said the frog
okay said the mouse
i am not busy
it will be fun they walked together for a while the frog said let me tie your foot to
to by back leg that way i won't lose you okay said the mouse that will make us close friends
the frog took some some string and tied the mouse to his leg
when the frog hopped the mouse hopped too it was funny
they laughed
they went to a field the frog ate bugs
and the mouse ate grass after the field they went to a lake the mouse cried when he saw the water
i do not like the water frog
i want to go to the barn
the mean frog said
i think you need a bath mouse you have never
had one
and it is hot come on it will feel good
the frog jumped into the water the mouse tried to get away
but could not the frog laughed

people traveled in wagons pulled by horses
s
that sounds like fun i said
it was not fun
for my great grandma her family had to cross rivers plains mountains and a desert
the united states is a big country
they went from one side to the other
i thought i had to sneeze
s
gram opened the book to the middle
this tells what it was like on the plains
i'll read it
may fifteen eighteen sixteen
we are crossing the great plains
everything is so flat
s
i can see miles and miles of grassy land
i see mountains but they are still ahead s
so far away i think we'll never reach them
i had to walk beside the wagon all day because the horses were tired
now i am very tired and my legs hurt
what what are the plain i asked gram
it is a flat land
it has grass but few trees she said
when great grandma crossed the plains few people lived here

okay may walked slowly from the
spaceship and took a deep breath
all
all the kids from may's planet came to m
matter
at the end of every school year each year the they got a
different problem they had to solve the
problem
to enter the next grade
this was may's first trip
she had been
wondering about her problem
all year today she would find out
may
may opened her
envelope and read her
problem you must find three
hmm may's may
said she spoke to her
robot
robot computer
define matter
the
the robot computer buzzed and blinked
words appeared
on its screen matter
anything that takes up space and has
mass well may thought i know that water takes up space and has mass so water must be matter
may
hurried to the teacher
ms wrong her voice came from a
loudspeaker on the
s
spaceship get started students you only have two hours
to solve your problems may opened her map
circled the place that she thought might have
water then she turned on her jet
pack waved
at the special spaceship and flew off
as she flew may
thought
about her problem i must find three
forms of water
water is matter can matter have more than one from again
it must have three forms too i must find water as solid and liquid and a gas i know where three liquids water
she flew to the lake of tears and landed on
its shore she took a jar from her packet
and the
robot filled it
that's liquid water she said
now i need
the two other forms
may checked the map and flew
few flew
towards the frozen mountain may arrived at the frozen mountain of
landed
at the bottom of an ice
cliff she shut off
her jet pack and spoke to her
robot question
what is ice the robot blinked
ice ice is a solid it frozen water
hey hey this isn't so hard may smiled
ice is the second
from the water she picked up a
rock and broke off a piece of ice she dropped the ice into a plastic bag
now i need to find a third form
from
the water
she thought what can it be she looked at
the map again both maya
slimy
steaming springs looked like good place to find water stepping springs was
close closer
i'll go there first first may decided she turned
on the
jet pack and flew off to the spring time was running out
may landed in steaming springs
she spoke to her robot once again
question what is the steam of the robot buzz steam is a gas it was water and a gas from steam is that third form the water i've found it maya told the robot
to fill a plastic bag with steam
the bag filled it like a balloon the may sealed the mouth of the bag
now back to the ship she cried when may got back to the ship mrs is wong was outside waiting for her she smiled oh may i was
worried about you didn't you solve your problem yes mrs wrong
replied may it was easy really that teacher asked yes maya said i learned that
matter w has three forms solid liquid and gas water is matter i found three forms of water to solve my problem
maya opened her pack she pulled out
jar
she took out a plastic bag and
h here is steam the gas may was shocked
the plastic bag didn't
look like a balloon anymore it held only a few drops of water
what about the third form asked mrs wrong
may didn't know what to say
the other plastic bag held only liquid water too
what happened she cried i really didn't find three different forms of water
now i have only one
mrs wrong laughed
it's ok may you you've learned something else about matter
when you
heat or cool matter it can change from heat
melted
the solid ice
the steam cooled and became liquid you mean
i passed asked may in surprise yes you did answered mrs wrong may ran happily into the spaceship was
was wrong that next year problem would be
uhm
sil
well
sil
uh
sil
she goes to planets and she rides in a spaceship to get there and she's trying to find matters of water
sil
uhm
sil
and her teacher says it's ok because like she wanted to show her teacher but it turned into water
uhm
sil
i forgot what she had to find
uhm steam
sil
and i forgot the other two
the rid riddles of aunt red wing
so do i read who it's by
cassie looked at
at
cassie looked at the postcard it had no
postmark
or stamp
because it had come in a letter
to her mom mother
it was from aunt red
aunt red wing an aunt red wing
ever since aunt red wing had begun to travel
she had put
postcards for cassie in mother's letters
aunt red wing took people on trips all over the world
the postcards she went
she she sent cassie always had a riddle
about
where she sh where she was
this postcard
read
cassie studied the riddle
i wonder how the length of shadows can tell where
aunt red wing is
i think i'll ask matt
cassie thought
her brother matt
was in high school
he worked after school
at the public library
cassie liked to visit him there
as he as she walked the library
ca ca library cassie read
the riddle
over
over and over again
noon shadows are long
the sun
sets soon
where is it cold in the
month of june
she had some ideas
but she
wanted to ask matt
a question
hi said matt
when cassie came to his desk
what's new
hi said cassie
look what i have
other postcard from aunt
red wing matt laughed
that means you have another riddle to figure out
yes i do
cassie said
shadows are the first clue
to the riddle
you can tell the seasons
by the length of shadows
you can you
certainly can said matt
he reached for
a lamp on his desk
look at the floor
ca
cassie
what do you see
when when i hold the lamp
like this
cassie looked on the floor i see a short
i see a short shadow
see
said
she said
but i don't see what it is ha
i at but i don't
but i don't
see what it has to do
to do with the seasons
let's
pretend
that lamp
is the sun
said matt
when the light shines from above the shadow
is short
during the summer the moon
sun
is high
and shadows are shorter
but when i hold the lamp
at this angle
the shadow grows longer
that's right said matt
when i hold the lamp
at the angle like the noon sun
is
in the winter
the shadows are long
aunt red wing is in a place where the noon shadows
are
long said cassie
since the noon sun is low in winter it must
be winter
where aunt red wing is
where aunt red wing is
cassie was proud of herself
that's right
said matt
what it what
what's next what's the next
clue
the second clue is
that the sun
sun sets
soon
cassie thought for a moment
i know
the sun
sets much earlier
in the winter
than it does in the summer
so that also
tells us it's winter
here
aunt red wing is right again said matt
but i haven't solved
the riddle yet
said cassie she looked at the
globe
on matt's desk
isn't this
the equator she asked
pointing to a line around the middle of the globe
that's right said matt
well said cassie
people who live south of the equator have winter starting
in june
and summer in january
don't they don't they
that's true said matt
if it
if it is if it is winter in june then aunt red wing must be somewhere south of the
equator
cassie thought
she looked carefully at at the globe
aunt red wing
could be in south america south america or australia
maybe she she's somewhere in africa
said cassie maybe there's another clue said matt
what
is the picture on the card
it's some animal
i didn't look too
it's
i didn't look too closely
cassie turned the postcard over
she laughed a koala bear
look matt
it's a koala bear
they live only in australia don't they
matt nodded
we were so busy trying to guess the riddle that we never even looked at the picture
that's right
said cassie
australia has koala bears and
and winter in june
and long winter shadows at noon
said matt
and aunt red wing
and her riddles laughed
cassie
so should i take these off uhm
sil
they were trying to guess riddles that uhm aunt red wing
sil
had a g gave a letter to them and uhm so they uh
sil
they were uhm trying to guess the riddles but and they didn't see the picture so it was harder for them to guess it after they did the riddles because they knew didn't they knew it was south of the equator but they didn't know where it was south of the equator cause that's all the clues told them so when they saw the picture they knew where it was cause
sil
well because uhm there was like
sil
they found the equator and they
sil
and they found the r they found the riddles and
sil
uhm and uhm they they found out that these riddles they solved the riddles and after they solved them they found out that the people south of the equator
<br>

the lamps now glitter down the street faintly sound the falling feet

hickory dickory dock the mouse ran up the clock the clock struck one the mouse ran down
hickory dickory dock inside the hollow wall of a house way up near the roof for lived a family of mice it was a snug little home he was nice and quiet and a and as dark as any mouse could ever want mamma mouse liked it
the wind that came through the roof made it cool in summer
in summer
and they were near the chimney
to keep
in the family they there were three children named hickory and dickory and dock
there had once been a papa mouse as well but he died while he was hunting for food one night he saw a nice piece of cheese in a box and tried to get it when he stuck his head into the box it closed with a snap
when mamma mouse came down to look for him he was dead
mamma mouse was sad to be all alone she felt that people were mean to kill a poor mouse because he wanted to get food for himself and his family
mice can't the earn money like people do to do
this so they have to live by stealing food mamma mouse was a brave mouse and knew that it was her job to find food for their her children so she dr dried her eyes and went to work chewing through the board
between the kitchen and the wall
it took time to this because she could only work at night mice like to sleep during the day and work at night at people
at night they there are no people around to bug them
and even cats sleep some sleep some mice run about in the day but they are not very smart
at last mamma mouse chewed a hole through the board
big enough for t for her to get through and to the kitchen but she was sad to find the bread covered with a pan
how mean people are to put things where a hungry mouse cannot
get to them said mamma
mouse with a sigh but just then she saw a barrel of flour on the flour that made her happy she knew she could easily chew through that and that could eat the flour instead of bread it was not
it was now
almost morning mamma mouse decided to leave the attack on the flour barrel for the next night she took a few crumbs that were on the floor
for her children and ran back into the wall up to her nest hickory and dickory and dock were very glad to get the crumbs because they were hungry when they had
eaten they they all curled up with their mother and slept all day
be good children said mamma mouse the next
the night
she was getting ready ready for her journey to the kitchen
don't come out of our nest till i come back
after tonight we will not be hungry for a long time
i will chew a hole at the
at the back of the flour barrel
will
where i will not be found
she kissed each one of them good bye and ran down the wall
when they
were left alone hickory wanted to go to sleep again but
little dock was wide awake he jumped around in the nest so much that his brothers could not sleep
i wished i could not i could go with mother some night said dock
it's no fun to stay here all the time she will take us when
we are big enough
said dickory
we are enough now said dock and if i knew
my way i c would go out into the world and see
what it looks like
i know a way out said hickory but mamma wouldn't like it if we
went with her without her
she doesn't have to know said the bad dock
oh yes
do said dickory well said hickory i'd like to take a little stroll
myself
but you must promise to be very careful and not get into any trouble i'll take you through the hole that i found so the three little mice started off with the hickory showing the way soon they came to a crack in the wall hickory stuck his head through
he saw that all was quiet family of people
that lived in the house
was fast asleep
so he went through the crack and his two
brothers came after
their their little hearts beat very fast because they knew
if they were found they would have to run for their lives
they crept over the thick carpet until they came to some stairs what shall we do now hickory asked his brothers let's go down said dock
so
so they went down the stairs to the hall
all of the house very carefully
they were surprised by what they saw
there was a big wall for hats and coats a bucket of umbrellas two very pretty chairs and a best of all a tall clock
that stood on the floor
and ticked out the minutes in a loud and strong voice
what is it asked dickory
quietly i don't know said hickory he was afraid too
is it alive asked dock i don't know said hickory again
then they saw that the clock didn't notice them
but
kept ticking away so they got their courage up and ran about suddenly dickory gave a yell that made his brothers come running
there is a corner lay almost half of a muffin
the little girl of the family had it was a great
find for the three mice
they ate until the last crumb was gone
and they were fat and happy this is
better than the kitchen said dock
they had finished their supper
and i bet there
are plenty more things around
if we only look for them but they couldn't couldn't find
more all the doors in the hall were closed dock went and
to the clock
he found nothing except a hole
to his
to inside of the clock
and he stuck his head in dock could hear the ticking louder
than never now he looked way up to the top of the clock and saw something bright
he thought it it must be good
e to eat
if he could only get to it
without saying anything to his brothers
dock ran up the sides
of the clock until he came to the gears
he was just about to bite a at a shiny wheel to see what it
it was a one o'clock
the clock was just telling the time but the big bell was
just beside dock's ear
and the noise hurt the poor little mouse he screamed with fear and ran
d and ran down the
clock as fast as he could
go
when he got to the hall he heard his brothers running
up the stairs he ran after them as fast as
he could only
when they were safe in their nest again did they stop to breathe they were so scared that their little hearts beat fast for an hour
mamma mouse
came
back in the morning
she brought some nice flour with her for breakfast they told her about their adventure she thought
they
had been punished enough already for
not listening to her so she did not
scold them
she only said you see my dears your mother in knew best
when she told
you not
leave the nest
children sometimes
think they know
more than their parents this adventure could teach you always to listen to your mother
the next time you run away
it may end worse than last night
after all remember what happened to your poor father
but hickory and dickory and dock did not run away again
uhm
sil
like that the ph the phantom said he's getting destroyed
sil
<br>
and
sil
and
sil
that's when their mother goes out and w well to the kitchen and and the three little mice which wanted to go out and try to find her and i think doc went up the clock and
sil
and he saw that it was one o clock and
sil
yeah and
sil
he he screamed a word but i forgot it and he ran down and then came home and she came home back home and she gave them the food and then they ate it
ok a farmer who had worked hard all his life was sick he knew that he would die soon he called his three sons to bed to give him
to give them some ideas
<unk> what's that word
advice
they were good sons but did not
but did not like farm work they wanted to make money fast
my sons he said take good care of the orchard do not sell it
there is a pot of gold under the dirt dig for it if you want turn
turn over every foot of earth then turn it again and again
the treasure is there
so do i click exit now
the sons tried to get him to tell them where the
gold was hidden he would not
tell
tell them after
he would not
tell them
after the farmer was gone
the sons
went to work to find the pots of gold
they did not
they did not know where the hidden place was
they decided to begin in
in a line
at one end of the orchard and dig until one of them found the money
they dug until they had turned up the soil from one end of the orchard to the other
they dug around the tree roots and between them
but they found no pot of gold
they thought maybe someone had stolen it
they thought maybe their father had gone crazy
the three sons were upset to have worked for nothing
the next
olive
do does that say olive
the next olive s season
the olive trees in the orchard grew more fruit than ever the
the good work they had done digging brought the fruit
the was so good that when it was sold they got they got a whole pot of gold
the sons saw how much money
had come from the orchard
then they knew what the wise what the wise father had meant when he said there is gold in the orchard dig for it
yeah
the boy and the nuts
uhm k
the glass jar half full of nuts was on the
was on a table
albert who loved nuts saw it
he climbed up on the table and put his hand into the jar he grabbed a whole handful
then he tried to put his hand
to pull his hand out
the mouth of the jar was too small for his fist
he pulled and pulled and became very angry at the jar
but it was no use his hand was stuck
at last he began to scream and cry his mother ran ran to the room
to see what was wrong with him
what's the matter albert she asked this mean old jar will not let me have this handful of nuts cried albert
his mother laughed when she saw the
c cause of all the trouble
you greedy boy you don't need a whole handful at once she said
try taking out a few at a time
bert let go of the nuts and took only two his hand came out easily
when you get into trouble again stop and think of a way to fix it instead of screaming said his mother
and next time don't be so greedy
well there well the father tells tells the three sons that there was gold in the orchard and they needed to find it so they dug one season and they didn't find it and then the next season they dug really good and they uhm and and it was and the fruit turned out to be better than ever for the year that past so when they selled them they got a whole pot of gold so so what the story is telling you
<br>
is that you can get gold by working really hard
well albert sees sees sees sees uhm sees some nuts on the table and a jar and he and he loves nuts so he wants to take a bunch but when he tried to take a bunch out his whole hand gets stuck in the top cause it's too wide so he starts screaming after a while and his mom comes down and asks him what's the trouble
<br>
so uhm s so he said this this mean old pot won't let me have a handful of nuts but his mom tells him that he doesn't need a whole handful he only needs a few at a time so so he took out a few and his hand came out easily so because he wasn't so greedy and being so mean

he
uhm i
he

day was there was
a dog
in a park
near where
where he lived

he
enjoyed playing at the dog park
because he didn't have

t
ta
tan
ta
an
t
tan s
talks
were
the
t
tan
tanks
were full of
all kinds
of fish
they
were also
filled with
bubbles
why do
why
do you put bubbles in
the fish tank
asked tom
it
it
it looks like the fish are
talking
a
taking a bubble bath
we
those
bubbles are
filled with air
explained
mr
chu
ch chu
fish need to breath air
just like people do
to
to keep
to keep
our fish healthy
we
clean their there
their air and water
we use
an
air
plum
pump
to
p
put
fresh air
into
their tanks
the
air
pump
makes the bubbles
how does
the water get clean asked tom
the air pump
pushes
the water through
a filter
s
an
and sweat
and
answered
r
answered mr
ch chu ch
the
fish
the filter
works like
a net
it
traps
dirt
that
collects
in the w
water
collects in the water
when
when
the
water comes
out of the
pump
it is clean
tom
looked
at
the fish
but
he couldn't stop thinking about
the bubbles
mr
ch
ch
mr
chu
why are some bubbles big
why are some some
small
some bubbles have more air
in
them than other bubbles
a bubble
holds air
just like a
just like a balloon said mr
chu
the
more air
you blow into a balloon the bigger it gets
if
tom
tom looked at the bubbles
in the fish tank
my
fish
bowl doesn't have an air pump
he
said
there are no bubbles
of
no bubbles of air
in the water
is that why my fish
are sick
maybe said mr chu
now
often
do you
change the water in the bowl
i haven't changed it
said tom
if you don't use a
tom
you must change
the water twice a week
said mr
ch
chu when you give your fish
a
fresh water
when you give your fish fresh water
they'll
start to
feel better
they will
get
they will get
plenty of
air air to breathe
thank you mr chu
it's
said tom
i want
my fish to be happy
and
healthy
that's up to me
to take care of them
mel melvin
and
m m muff

a
good friend like you
said mr chu
as he
waved goodbye to tom
<br>
there was a boy who was
sil
had got fish for his birthday but he wasn't changing the water so the or he didn't have bubbles i mean
a pump to change to change the water to uhm for them to breath so they got sick and he had to go to the uhm to the pet store
and the uhm the person who owned the pet store told him what he needed to do
sil
so he was going so he decided to do that
it one day a long long time ago it was very cold winter
was coming and all the birds flew away to all warm south
the were
they would wait for the spring
should i read all
ok but one little bird had a broken wing and couldn't not fly he did
not know what to do
he looked all around to see if there was any place where he could keep warm he saw all the trees of the big forest
maybe the trees will keep me warm through the winter he said so he went to the forest hopping and fluttering with his broken wing
the first tree he came to was a silver branch
uhm beautiful branch tree he said
while you let me live in your warm branches
until he until springtime springtime comes
oh my said the
branch i
what a thing to ask i have to take care of my own
leaves through the winter go away
the little bi bird hopped and fluttered with his broken wing until he came to the next tree
it was a great big oak tree
oh big oak tree
will you let me live in your warm branches until the spring time comes
what a thing to ask said the oak tree if you stay in in my branches all winter you will be eating my acorns go away
so the little bird hopped and fluttered with his broken wing until he came to the willow tree by the edge of the brook
oh willow tree said the little bird will you let me live in your warm branches until the springtime comes no said the wi willow tree i never talk to strangers go away
the poor little bird did not wa know where to go but he hopped and fluttered along
his way
broken wing this
tree saw him
and said where d where are you going little bird i don't i do not know said the little bird
said the bird
the trees will not let me live with them and the wing is broken i cannot fly you may live in on one of my branches
said the spruce
h here is the warmest one of all but
may i stay all winter yes said the spruce i will have you
the pine tree stood beside the spruce when he saw the little bird hopping and fluttering with his broken wing he said
my branches are not
very warm
but i can keep the wind off because i am big and strong
so the little bird fluttered up into the warm branch of his spruce
the pine tree kept the wind off his house
then he
jump
per
tree saw
what the pine spruce were doing
she said all the wood give the little bird
for dinner for the winter but the branches
jumper
berries the are very good for little birds
the little bird was very happy in his warm nest away from the wind with his jumper berries to eat
the trees at the edge of the forest talked to each other
i would take care of the strange bird
bird i would risk may acorn said the oak
i will not talk to strangers said the pillow
and i the trees
would s
st would stood very tall and proud
that night the n the north wind came to the woods to play he blew at the leaves with the his icy breath and very
leave he t touched and felt the ground
he wanted to touch every leaf in the forest he loved to see the trees bare
may
may i
may i every
leaf he said to his father and the f
forest king no said the f forest king
the trees which were kind to the the bird with the broken wing may keep their leaves
so north wind had to leave them alone the spruce the pine and jumper tree
kept their leaves through all the winter and they
have done so very nice
uhm the little bird had a broken wing so he went uhm into uhm so he went into uhm he asked the trees if he could stay in the uhm in uhm his tree for the winter and the tree said no so he and he was walking and uhm like uhm another tree said to him which where are you going and he said nowhere and so uhm he's uhm and then so he let him stay with him for the winter whole winter

p
vision

won't be hard to write
louise was about to agree
but instead
she pointed
into
pointed
into
another cage look sam it's
it's a big
fat snake
i don't see it
right there
she said
lying in
in
the grass
but
it's hard to see because
it's green like the grass
but the snake
is
dark
and
the grass is light green

are
dark and light

at
the end of the day
louise and sam thanked ms gordon

and we had fun at the zoo
and
you learned
a lot about
one
of
your
senses ms gordon replied
your eyes
in
are
very important they take
take in light and send messages
about the light
to your brain
messages about color movement
and
di
dis
lo
distance
louise asked yes said ms gordon
and
whether something
is
beside us that
when we use
per
fa

a long low sound awakened le
from his dreams honk honk sound stopped
all newt could hear was waves slapping on the beach
net ran to the open window you couldn't see the lights in town he couldn't see the moon
the night air felt cold and damp
from the next room aunt helen spoke it's only the foghorn net net
we're fogged in he crawled back to bed and soon dreamed again
net wake woke to a hazy world
he watched water drip from the porch roof
as he ate blueberry muffins
the fog was beginning to clear
aunt helen laughed
the foghorn doesn't sound to tell us it's foggy sounds to warn sailors about rocks and land
it's like a lighthouse for the ears
neat newt said
she had promised to take him sailing on her boat
this fog won't last long she said
the temperature dropped last night the water vapor is in the air
con
condensed
the into water droplets that make
up the fog soon sunlight will warm the air
then we can go
sailing
by ten thirty the fog
had cleared
newt and aunt helen had put on life jackets
they carried their picnic lunch and oars down a sandy path to the dock
a rowboat drifted from a rope tied to the dock
they climbed in and aunt helen rowed sailboat
they planned to sail to an island and spend
the day exploring it
aunt helen owned a small sailboat it had a tiny cabin
did you ever want
a motor boat newt asked
aunt helen smiled no
she said
why not newt asked
asked newt
if the wind stops then you can go anywhere
motors are noisy replied aunt helen i like the peace and quiet of sailing
sometimes there's no wind but i know that soon the wind will blow again
net helped raise the sail on the mast a pole rising from the center of the boat
the sail reminded
newt of
of a sheet hanging on a clothesline
but the sail tied at the corners
instead of letting the breeze slip under it the way a sheet did the sail caught the breeze
cast off the morning line aunt helen said
newt untied the rope that held the boat he could not feel the boat begin to move
i'm going to teach you to stir aunt helen said
this is the tiller you use it to s you use it to steer the boat
she pushed the til the tiller toward the left side of the boat
of the boat
the front of the boat moved to the right
when it
moved the tiller toward the right the boat turned left
aunt helen moved the sail to catch more wind
you sail by knowing the direction of the wind she said
right now the wind is coming from the ocean
how do you know net asked one d one way is to look at the flag in town dock
on the town dock
aunt helen explained
what if you're far from land and you can't see the flag
newt asked
i tie a piece of red yarn to the top of the mast
aunt helen pointed up see it
it's called a
telltale
this is the morning breeze blowing in from the ocean
in the evening the wind
blows out from the land
why doesn't the wind always go the same way
in the daytime the ocean is cooler than land
so the air above the water is cooler than the air above the land
do you know what cool air does to warm air asked aunt helen
it pushes it out of the way said net
right when cool ocean
air pushes the warm land air out of the way a breeze blows from the ocean land
to the land
in the
evening the op opposite happens because the land cools off more quickly than the ocean does
when the cooler land air pushes the warm ocean air out of the way we get a breeze from land to ocean
two hours later the boat neared the island and entered a cove newt steered the boat toward so sandy beach then aunt helen dropped
the anchor and they <unk> to shore
after newt and aunt helen ate they explored the island
they returned to the beach late in the afternoon
net
noticed that the air was still
there's no wind at all
there's no wind at all
what happened to the wind he asked it's just the afternoon afternoon
doldrums
s aunt helen said
the land in sea are just about the same temper temperature so there's no wind
but how will we get home again
newt asked don't worry
there's going to be a good wind after six o'clock aunt helen said why don't we collect some shells while we wait
at six thirty the wind picked up
aunt helen decided to get back
on the boat as they raised the sail
net watched it snap in some strong breeze
is that magic or what
net asked
it's the changing temperatures
that we talk
about the mainland
is begin to cool
it cools faster than the ocean
the cool land air pushed the warmer ocean air out of the way so now the wind is coming from land
from the land
the at said
i want to learn how to sail can we go again tomorrow aunt helen smiled will tomorrow be a good day for sailing
let's ask the sunset
what will that tell us she said
red sky in the morning sailors take warning
red sky at night sailors take delight
the red sun settled down on the western horizon the rosy
glow of clouds stretched across stretched across the sky and turned
the white sail pink
net decided that tomorrow would be a fine day for sailing on the wind
uhm there's a little boy that
uhm
goes sailing with his aunt
and he learns how to
know when a good sail when you sail really well
and when you can't
uhm
that
this
the
<unk>
it like
the sunset can tell you
if you can go sailing or not the next day

once upon a time there was a little brown field mouse one day he was out in the grass to see what he could see
it was such a nice acorn i will take it home he said
so he put on so he put out his paw to touch it
but the little acorn rolled away from him he ran after it but it kept rolling
it came to a big oak tree with roots all over the ground
then it rolled under a big
little mr field mouse ran to the root and poked his nose at the acorn he saw a small hole in the ground
he went in
and saw some stairs going down into the earth
the acorn was rolling down so he went down too
down down down rolled
the acorn and down down down went the field mouse
he saw a tiny door at the foot of the stairs
the the shiny acorn rolled to the door and hit it
hit it with a tap the little door opened and the acorn rolled inside the field mouse went fast down the stairs
and into the door
it shut a
and he was
in a little room
in it there was a funny red man
he had a lit he had a little red cap and a little red coat and a little shoes with points
at the toes
you are in my jail he said to the field mouse why said the field mouse because you tried to take my acorn the little red man
it is my acorn i found it said the field mouse
no it is not said the little red man
i have it
you will never see it again the little field mouse looked at the room but he didn't see any acorn
he wanted to go back up the tiny stairs to his own home
but the little door was locked and the little red man
had the key
and he said to the mouse you will be mine you will take
my bed and clean my room and cook my make my bed and clean my room and cook my food
so the little brown mouse made the little red man's bed and cleaned the little red man's room
and cooked the little red man's food
at and every day the little red man went away out the tiny door and did not come back until afternoon
but he always locked the door after him and the and took the key
at last one day he was in such a hurry that he turned the key before the door was shut
the the door did not lock at all he went away away in a rush
the little field mouse knew that he could run away home but he did not want to go without a the pretty acorn
he did not know where it was he looked
everywhere
he looked in every little drawer
but it was not there he hooked in every closet but could not find it then he got up on a chair and opened
a teeny tiny door on the wall
there it was his
he took it in his paws then
then he took it in his mouth
then he ran away
he pushed open the little door he climbed up up up the little stairs
he came out the hole under the root
and ran and ran into the fields
at
last he came
to his own house
when he was in his own house he set the k tiny acorn on the table
he set it down
too hard with a little snap it opened like a little box
inside there was a tiny necklace it was a very pretty necklace it was made of jewels and
just the right size for a girl mouse
so the little field mouse gave the tiny necklace to his
to his little mouse sister
she thought it was pretty
when she did not wear it she kept it in the shiny acorn box
and the little red man never knew where
his necklace went because he did not know where the little
field mouse lived
he uhm
went off wandering
and he found an acorn
and he w the acorn rolled inside the house
and he went inside the house and he got trapped
and then he opened a little door and he found a the acorn and then
he went up the stairs and he went around the field and found his home
and the little red man uhm trapped him
then he was s in such a rush that he didn't lock the door because
he
he was
because he opened the door and he he locked it when he opened the door and then the mouse got away
the
the boy and the nuts
a glass jar half full of nuts was
on a table
albert albert
albert
who loved nuts saw it he climbed up on the table and put his hand
into the jar he grabbed a whole handful
then he tried
to pull his hand out his mouth
the mouth
of the jar was too small for his fist
he pulled and pulled because
because
became very angry in the jar
but it was no use
his hand was stuck
at last he began to scream and cry his mother ran to the room to see what was wrong with him what's the matter
albert
she asked
this mean old jar will not let my hand
have this hand of nuts cried albert
his mother laughed and when she thought p
case of his
trouble
you greedy boy
you don't
need a whole handful at once she said
try taking
talking out a few at the time
albert
albert came to go
let go t of the nuts
and took only two
his hand came out easily when you get into
into
trouble again stop and think of a way to fix it
instead of screaming said his mother
oh and next time
don't get so greedy
albert was trying to like
take
out some nuts because he loves peanut
well he loves nuts
and
he grabbed a whole handful
so he tried to take <unk> but it won't go but then he took out t like a couple at the time and then it fit
then it came out
jeff gripped
a
with one
quick quick push on the pedal with a chain wrapped around the gear
he there he said to his
to his friend mike now try it
mike rode the bicycle down the driveway
and circled back toward jeff
gee thanks he said
it's a brand new bike jeff grinned
he liked the fixing when he just looked up in time to see his new puppy running up the hill mom he cried
i there goes puddles
we can go after him on our bikes jeff's mom looked out the window yes yes but come back and do your homework remember you must us turn in your ideas for the science fair project tomorrow
the boys jumped on their bikes and headed up to the hill
the boys jumped
they saw puddles up ahead
his golden ears flopped up and down as he ran over the hilltop
the boys pushed harder on the pedals as they climbed
the steep hill change your gears mike yelled jeff he watched as mike's chain slipped over a large gear thanks jeff
that makes me pedaling much easier at the top of the hill the boys kept <unk> breath mike was puzzled jeff why did shifting make it easier to pedal i don't know it's just when i got something to do with gears answered jeff
i'm just glad that we won't need to pedal so hard to get down the hill the boys looked d the hill below they could see the roller coaster in the new amusement park
the park was called the fun station
look at those hills
hills mike
bet we would need
some big gears to climb them and strong legs too added mike jeff looked down at the fun station fence puddles was digging under the gate oh no he groaned mom said that the fun station was off limits until
oh
off limits until it opens next summer the boys coasted down the hill
and then uphill pedaling pad off
jeff wondered how fast they could go imagine how fast they could go on the roller coaster mike and ike jeff and mike squeezed their hand t brakes to slow down they reached the fence they jeff dropped to his knees he peered through the hole
puddles was nowhere in sight puddles puddles
mike and jeff shouted but puddles did not return
then over the sounds of the workers they heard a family a familiar bark from f from the over other side of the fence a woman spoke have you lost your dog yes cried jeff do you have do you have puddles
well said the woman i don't know if it's puddles but it's a friendly cocker spaniel
that's puddles cried jeff can you make him come back through this hole the woman laughed here i bet it's easier if puddles
les if i open the gate
a few minutes
and it's puddles w was in jeff's arms jeff hugged
him puddles wiggled to get free but he was jeff wasn't about to let him escape again
jeff looked up at the woman thank you for bringing puddles out
no problem said the young woman my name's lisa i'm one of the engineers building the great gravity machine i i was playing with puddles when i heard you call
that's the great
what's the great gravity machine asked jeff that's the name for the roller coaster lisa pointed toward the big steel hills wow it's huge
said mike can see why they call it the
call it the great
but why about gravity
well gravity is a force a force that pushes
pulls things explained lisa on the roller coaster cars attach to the chain that wraps around gears then the engine turns the gears and the chains pulls the cars up the hill first them
at the first hill
the highest one
the first hill is always the highest one when the cars reach the top the force of the gravity pulls it down the hill m and then when they reach the bottom when the cars are going fast enough to get up the next hill by themselves yeah jeff nodded gravity is why we go so fast down the hill on our bikes that's right
lisa replied
your bicycle and
and the roller coaster both use gravity but there is one big difference
your bike has pedals
the roller coaster cars have no pedals no engine
the roller coaster car has several simple machines simple machines have only two or
one or two parts the simple machine is an
what's a ra
amp what's a ramp a machine
asked mike
sure said lisa a machine is anything that helps you do things more easily suppose that you had to climb up the hill straight and then the ground top that roller coaster coasts
hill
that would be tough said jack it's much easier for a roller coaster to climb a ramp than go straight up lisa explained
mike had an idea our bikes
go up the hill are they machines
lisa nodded your bike is made of several simple machines the pedals help you turn
the wheels the pedals are part of a simple machine called the wheel and the axle the hand and brakes are a simple machine called levels levels
how about the gears
ears asked mike
you're right the gears are simple machines answered lisa
then just then puddles
from on jeff caught the puppy and clipped and clipped his leash i guess puddles thinks it's time to go home
jeff laughed
jeff laughed
i guess
puddles pulled his leash
leash while the boys thanked lisa
i know you're very welcome come back this summer and i'll let you
come back this summer and
and let me know i know how you you like the roller coaster ride
as the boys turned home mark
matt mike thought about his homework i know that i'm going to do for the science fair he announced
on
jeff smiled he planned to build a roller coaster of it's collection you would call it the little little gravity machine
well what happened in the story is uh
there are two boys named jeff and
they were there were two boys named jeff but i don't know the other person's name
jeff and mike
mike and they're were wondering and they were chasing puddles
and uh then they wanted to know about
and then puddles got the
then puddles escaped
and
puddles uh
basic kind of escaped and then they
puddles then a young woman named and then lisa
a young woman named lisa
helped them uh
uh helped them get puddles back
and uh
and then they were wondering about the great gravity machine and she told
and lisa told them all about the gravity and the gravity machine
and how it works and the gears on the bikes and that's the end
lois and sam

sam and
lois followed
the group into the snakehouse
they stopped in front of three windows
lois looked through the windows
what snakes
what snakes do you see
she asked

lois was about to
agree
put inside instead
she
pointed
to
another
cage
look sam
it's a big
fat snake
where sam asked
i don't see it
right there she said laying
the grass
it's hard to see because
it's green like the grass
but the snake is dark
and
the grass is light green
oh i see it now
hey those are
two more
facts about eyesight
we can see
things that
work that are dark and light and
we can see color
sam said sam
lois pointed to another cage
i recognize
this snake she said
it's a king cobra
and
look
said sam

when racer the dog
when his owners got him as a puppy all he wanted to do was run and run so his owners named him racer
sil
then when he got older he developed problems with his back legs
every time he ran he would he would limp
but that didn't stop him from running because like most dogs racer loved to run
there was a dog park near where he lived
he enjoyed playing at the dog park because he didn't at the dog park because he didn't have to be on his leash when he was there so he could run as much as he liked
there was one dog at the dog park named fang
he would always come up to the racer to racer and bite his back leg and run away saying bark bark bark bark
sil
which in dog talk means you are too slow to catch me with that limp of yours so i'm going to pick on you
racer would always chase fang but he could never catch him
one day racer went to the vet
racer liked the vet because people in white the white coats gave him treats racer didn't know
sil
didn't know th but he but at the vet af he would have to have surgery to fix his legs
when he awoke up from the surgery he didn't even remember where he was
sil
but soon his owners came and drove him home
on the drive
sil
home um on the drive home racer realized that his legs itched very badly
i thought
sil
he thought oh boy i'm going to lick my leg so hard that the itching is going to go away
so he turned his head around to lick his leg but there was a big white thing in his way
he was wearing a collar that made it impossible to lick his legs
a few days later he went with his owners to the dog park
racer had to be on a leash since he still needed to heal from his surgery
but it was nice to see all his friend
mean old fang said bark bark bark bark which meant
why do you have that
why do you have to wear that stupid looking collar it sure does look silly
eventually racer didn't have to wear the collar but then his legs didn't itch so he didn't want to lick them
for six weeks racer would take long walks and go to the dog park but still he had to be on a his leash
one day he took a walk to the dog park and all his friends were there as usual
then his owners reached around his neck and took off his leash leash
then just then fang bit him on the back leg and ran away
racer's owners said go run so racer started running and chasing fang
fang was laughing because he knew racer could never catch him but suddenly he noticed that racer was catching up
racer was f running fast racer was running faster than he could ever remember and before he knew it he had caught up to fang and knocked him down
racer said bark bark which in dog talk meant means don't pick on me any more fang
and from that day on fang never bit racer's legs
racer was so happy that he could run fast that he ran in circles
and than ran in circles
finally he came back to his owners and gave him gave them big kisses for fixing his legs
ok well
should i tell like about it
well once there was this there was this dog who
well he liked to run alot so he um
sil
so what he did was
sil
he would well they had his legs when he grew older his legs would get they would hurt or something like that
so then they um and this one they would go to the dog park and then this one dog named fang would bite him on the legs and say to him you're so you're like you can't run fast you'll never catch to me and tease him
and then one day they took him to the vet and he's real happy and then um he doesn't know that he's gonna get surgery
sil
and then after the surgery his legs are hurting his legs are just itchy
and then they have to put a collar on him so he doesn't lick it
sil
then <br>
sil
well then they um well then when he goes they in six weeks he can run again and take they collar off so then
sil
ne this time he fang does the same thing and
then racer chases after him and catches him then knocks him down
and then he's so happy that he runs around in circles
and then after that they he gives big kisses to his owners for fixing his leg
and that's the end

justin and his hat
one day justin and his mother went shopping for hats and found the perfect one
but justin would never wear the hat that made his mom roll her eyes
it wasn't that he didn't like the hat in fact he loved it
he thought it was great it totally fit his head
he loved the way it was a little tight at first but then stretched to the perfect size
he loved the color the size the shape and the new hat smell
he even liked the way his hair looked when he took the hat off
unfortunately justin was too smart for his own good
<br> he figured out that the hat would get do dirty or lost if he wore it too much
so he made a promise to himself that he would never wear it except on special days
he wanted the hat to be clean and perfect forever
if it gets dirty i'll wash it silly
his father said you should really wear the hat if you like it or else you will be sorry
but justin doesn't didn't listen and everyday the hat sat in a clear plastic box so that it wouldn't get dirty
sometimes justin would imagine him walking around school with the hat on his head
<br> once he even imagined himself as a grown up wearing the hat and speaking in front of many people
he imagined the people whispering to themselves what a fine speaker he is and such a handsome hat too
on his b next birthday he decided to wear the hat
<br> there were too many present there were many presents but the only thing that made justin excited was getting to wear his hat
he went in t to his room opened the plastic box and took the hat out very carefully
then he slowly slid it on
it was a little tight at first like it was supposed to be
it was just like he remembered
he was so happy that he couldn't help but smile
i know it's just a hat he thought to himself but i sure do love it
but then he noticed that it wasn't stretching
<br> something was wrong it was a little tight
justin could tell it wasn't perfect anymore
he knew crying wouldn't help make the hat perfect again but he cried anyway
he told his parents i don't want any of those gifts i want to return them all and try to find a new perfect hat instead
his parents looked at each other and knew that justin had learned a good lesson
son we would be happy to buy you a new hat but only if you promise to wear it the father said
<br> justin replied i promise that if we find the perfect hat i'll wear it everyday
<br> so the next day justin and his mother went shopping for hats and found the perfect one
from then on justin would never take it off and that made his mom roll her eyes
uh huh um well
sil um justin he he was a boy he got a hat from his mother
and he didn't want it to get dirty
<br> cause he knew that if he wore it too much it would get dirty so he put it in his room and he didn't wear it for a while and then on his next birthday he decided to wear his hat
<br> and it was too small for him <br> and he couldn't fit it on his head very well
<br> and he instead of um getting the birthday presents he wanted to find a new hat
<br> um that would fit him again and he learned that um he should just put his hat on because he didn't even get to wear it at all
and it wasn't any fun for him to keep it
<br> so it was better for it to get dirty a and he could have fun with it

sil
the panda
why did a panda with a beautiful girl name yin yang er yin yin have her name changed to the very un beautiful name columbus
it was fred's idea so let's begin with fred
he didn't mind handling the raw meat he had to feed the to the tigers his main objection was to being eaten
no one could blame fred really since no one really wants to be eat eaten
some people do like the to bite their finger nails but since no one really wants to be eaten
sil
some people do like to bite their f er
sil
some people do like to bite fred was no okay
sil
okay but fred was a nail nail biter so being eaten was definitely not something he looked forward to each afternoon at three o'clock when it came time to feed the tigers
for fred when it came to the pandas he had a warm spot in his heart
actually it was a eighty five point five degree spot on his left kidney but the point is that he was very fond of feeding the pandas
there were three pandas and they were known as the pan family they were in orders of cuteness yin yin the daughter of poo poo the mother and moo man the gentle and always sleepy father
many people know that pandas eat bamboo a lot of it a lot of bamboo can get quite heavy so because of the pandas fred became very strong and was in terrific shape
but physical fitness was not the only reason fred loved the pandas the other reason was that anyone who gets within three feet of a panda panda automatically falls in love with them
it's a law of nature as at further dis distances pandas have a strange almost magical effect on human beings which makes us want to hug and squeeze things fred was not allowed to act actually hug the panda bears since that could be dan dangerous so all the other people in the zoo er
sil
the zoo would know that the pandas had just been fed when they saw fred hugging the rather un cuddly palm tree outside of the panda's home
it is interesting to point out that er at this time that more stuffed panda bears are sold at zoo gift shops then all of the other stuffed animals combined
this must certainly be
sil
this almost certainly be accounted for by this strange almost magical effect that pandas possess
but everything was not all bamboos and hugs at the zoo one morning fred was feeding yin yin er yin yin and said oh yin yin i wish that more people would come to visit the zoo
i knew i shouldn't be telling you this but it but we must have to sell you and your family to the big zoo in s san angeles
if we don't get more money
sil
it's not that you aren't selling enough stuffed panda bears it's just that there aren't
sil
th that there haven't been enough people coming to see you in the first place i think what the zoo needs is a great advertising campaign
fred was the st starting to feel uncontrollably urge to hug the panda so before he ran off to hug the palm tree qu qu
sil
quickly said costs us so much to feed you panda bears <unk> i would hate if y you had to leave us after all it's only home you know besides if you leave i'll get terribly out of shape now if you excuse me i need to hug some hug er squeeze something before i scream
but yin yin the p young panda was not listening to fred she was talking to her best friend maggie the magpie about going to the moon
yes the big one in the sky that is most likely not made not made of cheese and is certainly not made of bamboo
yin yin and her best friend maggie the magpie who are looking who looked a lot like a panda would look
sil
w would look if pandas were birds were discussing about going to the moon her mother and her father knew that what they er what they were talking about since they hadn't thought or talked of much else since yin yin said i want to go there and pointed to the moon
enough of this nonsense said yin yin's mother poo poo what sort of nonsense is this for a young panda bear go to the moon indeed nonsense
your job is to be cute so people want to run to the gift shop and buy panda bear dr dolls it's simple economics
like it or not we are spokespeople for the panda stuffed animal industry which young lady helps pay for the bamboo that you eat such nonsense going to the moon said her mother p poo poo but
sil
but i just learned how to make myself into a ball and roll two days ago and i've b i'm becoming very good at it i don't think it will take that long to roll there said yin yin
sil
yin yin's father moo man didn't think it was very proper or wise for a young panda bear to go rolling off places where there wasn't any bamboo but he was supportive of this h of his young daughter and showing his support by taking a nap
but before he s fell asleep he did manage to say i believe rolling is a decidedly rolling about way to go if you must go it it t'would be best to fly
nonsense said the mother i'm so mad i'm going to look at that lady over there and make her want to squeeze her son's cheeks she said spitefully
an instant later a young boy was heard saying ouch mom cut that out i'm sorry to say but many er but many a little boy's cheeks have been made raw when mother poo poo panda was up upset
yin yin was also one to take advice from father but less than a week later yin yin and maggie had built a rocket ship out of bamboo bamboo is very workable sub substance and pandas tend to handle bamboo a lot so this in itself was not astonishing at least to the yin yin er to the yin yin's parents fred was sure was impressed though
sil
the main obstacle it it turns out was getting the rocket ship off the ground
maggie figured out that if her and h three of her strongest magpie friends were to each grab hold of a corner of the rocket ship they could all fly to the moon so they tried
one two three to the moon they said together pulling with all their might
i see your wings flapping but we don't seem to be going anywhere said yin yin
hmm heavier than i thought i think we'll need more magpies said maggie but how many more said er yin yin said i'm not exactly sure replied maggie
the father watching all this through one eye for he had a for he always had at least one eye asleep at all times said
tis would be best to ask the owl and then closed h his eye
so maggie flew off to the owl and asked for h his advice oh wise owl i have a question that i fear only you can answer how she said
how to turn your head all the way around without getting a terrible pain in your neck said the said owl
no how many magpie's would be needed to fly a four hundred pound panda bear and a one hundred pound bamboo rocket ship to the moon said er yeah said maggie
sil
the owl instantly replied two hundred thousand and s seventy six give or take two
a week later maggie managed to round up two hundred thousand and seventy eight magpie she could be very persuasive little bird when she wanted
a week later despite much flapping they were all trying to get the rocket into the air
it turns out that the owl didn't take into consideration that once you get over one thousand magpies together they tend to fight and can't agree on a single thing
now while all this was going on what do you supposed fred was doing why he was feeding the pandas like he was supposed to
so one day after fred had fe feed fed the pandas and was hugging the palm tree the zoo manager came up to him and said what is going on with your pandas fred i've never seen anything like it
it's taken me a couple weeks to figure it out but i i think yi yin yin wants to go to the moon and the magpies want to take her there
oh well that makes sense then said the manager
do you know that since the little panda built the bamboo rocket ship and those and those magpie's started fluttering about that the zoo's profit have gone gone up four thousand percent
this is just the type of exposure we need those pandas will be with us for a long time
fred thought about it and said you know i think we should rename yin yin columbus
the zoo keeper said good heavens man that's a great idea no wait a second i don't understand
well when columbus set out on his ship he was really trying to find a quicker way to get to get through europe in order to improve trade
yes but what does that have to do with pandas man
well it seems to me sir that yin yin wants to be a great explorer instead became a business woman
i see fred one more thing sir about these magpies flying above the pandas do you think that the zoo could purchase me a large sized umbrella
the zoo manager laughed and walked away but did not pur purchase a fashionable yellow umbrella for fred the next day
back in the panda's home the mother panda poo poo was very proud of her daughter
after all if it weren't for yin yin they wouldn't have they would have had to move from their wonderful home
but later when fred walked into panda's home under his new yellow umbrella all she could think of to say was nonsense
as for yin yin she's very proud to be renamed after a famous explorer and she and maggie never stopped trying to get to the moon
uhm what happened in the story was uhm there was a panda named yin yin and she uh was uhm like she was
she basically tried to get she built like a bamboo rocket and she tried to get to the moon
and three magpies were trying to help her by flying her up there but it didn't work so they went and asked the uhm
sil
the owl in the story about how many uhm magpies it'd take to fly and it was like two thousand and seventy eight
and but it didn't work because all the magpies uh started fighting
and but what did happen is uhm the profits for the zoo increased and so uhm the
sil
the panda's like the zoo was about to be bought out before all this happened but their profits raised four thousand percent
so then they got to stay at the zoo and so instead of becoming a great explorer uhm yin yin became a great uh business woman
but she got named colombus after the great explorer colombus
and it's kind of the opposite of colombus because he wanted to be a great business man but instead he ended up a great explorer so
sil
<br>
sil
fred uhm well there's fred and he was the manager er no he was the person who fred all fed all the animals
and he didn't like feeding the tigers cause he was afraid he was going to get eaten
but when he fed uhm fed the panda's he always wanted to hug them but he wasn't allowed to because like the panda's supposedly have some magic about them
where if any human gets within three feet they like have to hug something
or else they'll go wild or something
and then uhm also there's uh yin yin's parents uh poo poo
and uhm her mother and moo man her father and when uh poo poo her uh yin yin's mother gets angry she uh
sil
she uhm
sil
oh yeah she sometimes makes uhm mother's squeeze their kids cheeks and so when she gets angry a bunch of kids get their cheeks rubbed raw
and then there's the manager and i don't know he doesn't do much in this story
the earl's next speech dashed the hope into a thousand fragments
sil
now all the people rejoiced because the wicked king should rule them no longer
sil
gracious ain't that an awful lot of money exclaimed davy crockett
sil
this little john did though without disturbing his master or rising from where he sat
sil
the next moment he changed the subject because it seemed the best thing to do
harrison chuckled if he chuckled at all in private and was all sympathy outwardly

sil

sil
the mistress stood stock still holding her hands at a level with her throat
the women replied only by vanishing as though suddenly mixed with the air
sil
she had loosened the lid and then she laughingly sat on it
sil
i think i think should think that you had an imagination sure enough she laughed
sil
do you know why i asked her to send me the manuscript
bouncer had passed a sleepless night and quarreled again at breakfast
sil
there jo was mistaken for the next day she made a discovery which produced a tempest
<br> dusky crimson rushed madly over the boy's face

the panda
why did a panda with the beautiful girl name yin yin have her name changed to the very un beautiful girl name columbus
it was fred's idea so let's begin with fred

uhm meanwhile fred is trying to figure out like
he's very sad cause the panda's might have to leave the zoo because there's not enough money and to keep them around <br> and

the panda
why did a panda with a beautiful girl name yin yin have her name changed to the b to the very un beautiful girl name columbus
it was fred's idea so let's begin with fred
fred fed the panda bears the tigers and the turtles
the turtles weren't so bad but as for the tigers he wasn't so sure
he didn't mind handling the raw meat he had to feed to the tigers his main objection was to being to being eaten
no one could blame fred really since no one really wants to be eaten
some people do not like to bite their finger nails but fred wasn't a nail biter so being eaten was definitely not something he looked forward to
each afternoon at three o'clock when it was time to feed the tigers
for fred when it came to the pandas he had a warm spot in his heart actually it was a eighty five point five degree spot on his left kidney
<br> but the point is that he was very fond of feeding the pandas
there were three pandas and they were known as the pan family
<br> they were in order of cuteness yin yin the young daughter poo poo and mother and moo man the gentle and always sleepy father
many people know that pandas eat bamboo a lot of it
a lot of bamboo can get quite heavy so because of the pandas fred became very strong and was
sil
in terrific shape
but physical fitness was not the only reason that fred loved the panda
the other reason was that anyone who gets within three feet of the panda automatically falls in love with them
it's a law of nature
at further distances pandas have a strange almost magical effect on human beings <unk> which makes us want to hug and squeeze things
fred was not allowed to actually hug the panda bears since that could be dangerous
so all the other people at the zoo would not know that the pandas had just been fed when they saw fred hugging the rather un cuddly palm tree outside of the panda's home
it is interesting to point out at this time that more stuffed panda bears are sold to zoo gift shops then all of the other stuffed animals combined
this can almost certainly be accounted for by this strange almost magical effect that the panda possess possess
but everything was not all bamboo and hugs at the zoo
one morning fred was feeding yin yin and said oh yin yin i wish that more people would come to visit the zoo
i know i shouldn't be telling you this but we might have to sell you and your family to the big zoo in san angeles
if we don't get more money it's not that you aren't selling enough stuffed panda bears
it's just that they haven't been enough people coming to see you in the first place
i think that the zoo needs its a great adventure campaign
fred was starting to feel the uncomfortable urge to hug the panda
so before he ran off to hug the palm tree quickly he said it costs so much to feed you panda bears i would hate it if you had to leave us
after all it's only home you know besides if you leave i'll get terribly out of shape
now if you excuse me i need to squeeze something before i scream
but yin yin the young panda was not listening to fred she was talking to her best friend maggie and magpie about going to the moon
sil
<br> yes the big one in the sky that is most likely not made of cheese and most certainly not made of bamboo
yin yin and her best friend maggie and the magpie <unk> who looked a lot like a panda would look if pandas were birds
sil
were discussing about going to the moon
her mother and father knew what they were talking about since they hadn't thought or talked of much else since yin yin said
i want to go there and pointed to the moon
enough of this nonsense said yin yin's mother poo poo
what sort of nonsense is this for a young panda bear going to the moon indeed nonsense
your job is to be cute so people won't to run to the gift shop and buy panda bear dolls
it's simple economics
like it or not we are spokespeople for the pandas stuffed animals industry which young lady helps pay for the bamboo that you eat
such nonsense going to the moon said her mother poo poo
but i just learned how to make myself into a ball and roll two days ago i've i have becoming very good at it
i don't think it will take that long to roll there said yin yin
yin yin's father moo man
sil
didn't think it was very proper or wise for a young panda bear to go rolling off to places where there wasn't any bamboo
but he was supportive of his young daughter and showed his support by taking a nap
but before he fell to sleep he did manage to say
nonsense said the mother i'm so mad i'm going to look at the lady over there and make her want to squeeze her son cheeks she said spitefully
an instant later a young boy was heard saying ouch mom cut that out
i'm sorry to say but many a little boy's cheeks have been made raw when mother poo poo panda was upset
yin yin was always one to take good advice from her father <unk> and less than a week later yin yin and maggie had built a rocket ship out of bamboo
bamboo is very workable substance and pandas tend to handle bamboo a lot so this is in itself was not that astonishing
at least to yin yins parents freds sure was impressed though
the main obstacle it turns out was getting the rocket ship off the ground
maggie figured that if she had three of her strongest magpie friends were to each grab hold of the corner of the rocket ship they could all fly to the moon
sil
so they tried one two three to the moon they said together pulling in their might
sil
i see your wings flapping but we don't see seem to be going anywhere said yin yin
hmm heavier than i thought i think we will need some magpies said maggie
yes but how many more yin yin said i'm not exactly sure replied maggie
the father watching this all through one eye
sil
for he was for he always had at least one eye asleep at all times
sil
said t'would be best to ask the owl
sil
then closed his eye
so maggie flew to the owl and asked for his advice
oh wise owl i have a question that i fear only you can answer she said
how to turn your head all the way around without getting a terrible pain in your neck said owl
sil
no how many magpies would be needed to fly a four hundred pound panda bear and a one hundred pound bamboo rocket ship to the moon said maggie
the owl instantly instantly replied two hundred thousand and seventy six give or take two
sil
a week later maggie managed to round up two hundred thousand and seventy eight magpie
<br> she could be a very persuasive little bird when she wanted
a week later despite much flapping they were still trying and to get out the rocket in the air
it turns out that the owl didn't take into consideration that once you get over one thousand magpie together <unk> they tend to fight and can't agree on one single thing
<br> now while all this was going on what do you supposed fred was doing
why he was feeding pandas like he was supposed to do
so one day after fred had fed the pandas and was hugging the palm tree the zoo manager came up to him and said
what is going on with your pandas fred i've never seen anything like it
it's taken me a couple of weeks to figure it out but i think yin yin wants to go to the moon and the magpies want to take her there said fred
oh well that makes sense then said the manager
did you know that since the little panda built that bamboo rocket ship and those magpies started fluttering about that the zoo's profits has gone up f four thousand percent
this is just the type of exposure we needed <unk> those pandas will be with us for a long time
fred thought about it and said you know i think we should rename yin yin columbus
the zoo keeper said good heavens man that is a great idea no wait a second i understand
well sir
sil
when columbus set out on his ship he was really trying to find a quicker way to get to get around europe in order to improve trade
he wanted to be a business man but instead became a great explorer
yes but what does that have to do with the the pandas man said the zoo keeper manager
well it seems to me sir that yin yin wanted to be a great explorer but had become a business woman
i see fred
one more thing sir <unk> about those magpies flying above the pandas do you think that the zoo could purchase me a large sized umbrella
the zoo manager laughed and walked away but didn't purchase a fashionable yellow umbrella for fred the next day
sil
back in the panda's home the mother panda poo poo was very proud of her daughter
after all it weren't if it weren't for yin yin they would have had to move from their wonderful home
but later when fred walked into the panda's h home under a a his new yellow umbrella all she could think to say was nonsense
as for yin she was very proud to be renamed after a famous explorer and she and maggie never stopped trying to get to the moon
i don't know it was about some panda who wanted to go to the moon
<unk>
sil
uhm it was about this like panda named
sil
uh yin yin and uhm she wanted to go to the moon
and so and her mom didn't want her to but her dad just really didn't care and uhm so she built a bamboo rocket with her friend magpie er whatever
and uh she and that pers and magpie like built it and then they didn't know how they were going to go get up cause one magpie couldn't lift the rocket and the thing so th and they went to the owl
and the owl told them to uhm to get like a specific number of magpies and uhm like to push the rocket up
and then the owl didn't think about how many like how they would all fight and stuff so they weren't getting along
and then uhm fred like the manager came up to fred one day after he was feeding the pandas and the manager said uhm what are your panda's doing and he answered like
sil
well i think
it's taken me a week to figure it out but
sil
you know i think yin yin wants to go to the moon
and then he said well it's brought us up like four thousand percent and it's really good and so those pandas are going to stay here a long time
the red leaves were blown around in millions by the wind
and meanwhile by the further river bank came rosalind with mushrooms in her skirt
now go and answer your note let me finish this splendid story
more courage than my poor brother who stands there like a coward
he she rushes frantically across the apartment seizing her hood and ran from the cottage
<br> they carried themselves as if as if they had been drilled both men and women
lindy not being overburdened with perception did not see this
i fear that we shall have another smart gale however it won't last long
of course there's nothing very entertaining here for you
the youngster lingered for a moment or two watching myles at his work
the day ethel brown was seven years old she had a tea party

seagrave knelt by his side took his hand and burst into tears
nan said it wouldn't grow in our garden but i brought some home to try
his boots creaked too so loudly but still he was not at all afraid
she will be glad to see you but she has been very badly frightened
he turned his back on the boy and conferred aside with lawrence
i desire it so much that i will take no refusal
and the prize cup grew clearer and nearer to her mental vision
behind lay the ship a picture not without its lighter side

well i don't get h why it says the very un beautiful girl name columbus
sil
<br> basically yin yin was trying to get to the moon
and yin yin the panda bear
sil
uhm was she's trying to get to the moon with her friend maggie the magpie
uhm
sil
but it doesn't work the first time cause they only have three magpies so
i think maggie goes to the owl and he says you need a whole bunch of uhm magpies so she goes and gets him and then uhm
sil
the
sil
then
sil
fred the person who feeds the panda bears
goes to the zoo manager and decides that they should rename yin yin
sil
columbus because they're getting so much money and christopher columbus was trying to find a faster route to
sil
europe i think and
sil
uhm
sil
he wound up making a lot of business and she's trying to get to the moon but she made a lot of business cause everyone wanted to buy panda dolls
sil
so that's basically what the story's about
it was a it was a deep dazzling lovely blue deeper than the deepest blue of the sky
what if he had the brains and military skill and all that sort of thing
sil
yes said anne candidly i've heard that you and he were engaged once
he had gentle and refined features and his voice was soft and pleasant in tone
sil
one would suppose that they knew nothing at all about school fairs but they do
sil
at practically the same instant the third shot whistled from the east

worst dose i i ever endured and i'd nothing to do but swelter in that heat
a shadow that chilled his heart seemed gradually to fall upon him
sil
it never occurred to him that she might be changed herself
good friend said the other gently i have business elsewhere

thereupon i told the king without any re rev r reserve all that had happened

hans went up and down the street of amsterdam that day looking for work

yes said ben immensely relieved to find that no offense had been taken

the king thought and thought frowned hard and rubbed his ear

what are those foolish bundles in the back of that silly cart

sil
but i'm awfully hungry i wish you'd get me something to eat
men rejoiced openly hoping that it would spread and send them into camp
marco only stood quite still and looked at him with understanding and gravity

yin yin was always one to take good advice from her father and less than a week later yin yin and maggie had built a rocket ship out of bamboo
this bamboo bamboo was a very workable substance and pandas tend to handle bamboo a lot

hmm heavier than i thought i think we will need need more magpies said maggie yes but how many more yin yin said i'm not sure exactly reply replied maggie
the father watching this all through one eye for he had always had at least one eye asleep at all times
said t'was would be best to ask the owl then closed his eye
sil
so maggie flew to the owl and asked for his advice oh wise owl i have a question that i fear only you can answer she said
how do you turn your head all the way around without getting a terrible pain in your neck said owl
no how many magpie's would we n would be needed to fly four hundred a four hundred pound panda bear and a one hundred pound bamboo rocket ship to the moon said maggie
the owl instantly replied two hundred two hundred thousand and seventy six give or take two
a week later maggie managed to round up two hundred thousand and seventy eight magpie
she could be very persuasive a very little persuasive bird when she wanted to
a week later despite much flapping they were still trying and to get the rocket in the air

said what's going on with your pandas fred i've never seen anything like it
it's taken me a couple of weeks to figure it out but i think yin yin wants to go to the moon and the magpies want to take her there fred said fred
oh well that makes sense then
sil
said the manager do you know that since the zoo's profits have gone up four thousand percent this is just the type of exposure he needed
those panda will sh those pandas
sil
oh oh well that makes sense then the man manager said did you know that since the little panda built that bamboo rocket ship and those magpie's started fluttering about that the zoo's profits have gone up four thousand percent
this is just the type of exposure we needed those pandas will be with us for a long time
fred thought about it and said you know i think w we should rename yin yin columbus but the zookeeper said good heavens man that is a great idea no wait a second i don't understand
well sir when columbus set out on his ship he was really trying to find a quicker way to get to get around europe in order to improve trade
he wanted to be a business man but instead became a great explorer
yes but what does that have to do with the pandas ma pandas man said the zoo manager
well it seems to me sir that yin yin wanted to be a great explorer and instead of became
sil
wanted to be a great explorer and instead became a business woman
the zoo manager laughed and walked away but did patch purchase a fashionable yellow umbrella for fred the next day
back in the panda's home the mother panda poo poo was very proud of her daughter
after all if it weren't for yin yin they would have they would have had to move for from
sil
their wonderful home
but later when fred walked into the panda's home under a his new yellow umbrella all she could think to say was nonsense
as for yin yin she was b very proud to re be renamed after a famous explorer and she and maggie never stopped trying to get to the moon
uhm it was about a panda who unless the zoo didn't make enough money they would have to move
and then the littlest panda wanted to try to get to the moon and since there was a bunch of commotion and th they were building a rocketship more people came to the zoo and they got enough money and they could stay at the zoo
sil
this story was about a p a family of panda's
sil
and the littlest panda was named yin yin and uh she and her family were at a zoo and the zookeeper's name was fred
and the zoo wasn't making enough money so if they didn't make more money then they would have to move the pandas to a different zoo
and fred didn't want that to happen cause fred was the zookeeper and he fed the pandas
so and uh yin yin wanted to try to fly to the moon so she and her friend maggie the magpie built a rocketship and got a bunch of other magpies
