well chris gram said today we can do anything you want we can read the book you your great grandmother wrote
i asked
yes said gram i'll go and get it
the book was very old and the pages were yellow the book smelled old
this is my great grandma's diary said gram th
she was your great great great grandma she wrote about how our family came west
when she was a little girl
didn't our family always live here i asked no chris they came to california from new york those days
there were no cars or planes
there were few trains people traveled in wagons pulled by horses
that sounds like fun i said
it was not fun for my great grandma
her family had to cross rivers plains mountains and des and a desert
they went from one side to the other
we are crossing the great plains everything is so flat
i can see miles and miles of grassy land
i see mountains
bought but
they are still ahead so far away
i think we'll never reach them i had to walk beside the wagon all day because the horses were tired
now i am very tired and my legs hurt
now
yeah
now i'm very tired and my legs her
what is a plain i asked gram it is flat land
it has grass but few trees she said
when great grandma crossed the plains few people lived there water
was hard to find today farmers grew food
there
did they ever get to the mountains i asked gram turned more pages here it is she said
september six eighteen sixty
we are in the rocky mountains
they are so high the weather is
very cold
and it's not even winter
far below i can see rivers
we will cross them soon
from here they look like little silver threads
did they cross the rivers i asked let's see said gram she turned more pages here's something about a river september thirtieth eighteen sixty two days ago we came
to a fast river it was the colorado river i am tired of crossing rivers
papa said that
we will reach the desert soon
er
for a river
i don't want to cross
the desert
what's a desert i asked
a desert
is very dry there is very little
water people can die without water gram told me
if i cr if i crossed a desert
i'd run fast i said it's not easy gram said let me find a page about
the desert here
it is she said
october fifteenth eighteen sixty
there is nothing here but sand
a it
is very hard to walk the water is bad to drink
as and we are not hot and thirsty in the daytime
we are cold and hungry at night
that was the hardest part of the trip gram said
my great grandma didn't think they would make it but they
did i said that's right said gram she turned more pages
this is the best part of the diary she s she said
november second
eighteen sixty papa got us to a river
now we have all the water we need
we climbed a hill from the top we saw big
green hills and valleys
papa says our new home will be there also
saw
i also saw water far away it s
it is beautiful i know we will be happy there
s
it was a long trip i said yes said gram sometimes they they weren't hungry sometimes they were afraid
but they never gave up i looked out the window i thought about how
i love california i'm glad
you're m great grandma came here i'm glad
y
you're my grandma too i said
gram gave me a hug
so
am i she said
uhm they're reading a dot
uhm chris and his grandma are reading a diary together and they are finding out things that
chris wants to know about his great grandma
she went through the desert and she found new land and there was bigger water in in the land than in the desert
they didn't have cars or trucks or anything so they had to ride in carriages
pulled by horses
and all and they didn't have planes either so they still had to use the carriages and stuff

she smiled at jack
i i it is magic jack said no metal only pulls some things said
donna
metal pulls paper clips and tacks but not apples and pennies said jack
can metal pull other m metals
asked jack

a magnets jack looked at them each magnet was red and black
donna
put the red en at
other magnets to
the black end of the magnet wow

other magnets try to put
two black
ends together said donna
oh no said jack the magnets will not go together the magnets are pushing apart

said donna the ends that are the same color push apart the ends that are different color push together jack said
jack held the magnets over his
he started to jump jack jumped up and he bumped into the ladder the box of tacks fell
jack
s
pi
oops jack said
magnets
he uhm
he found out that some metals don't work with magnets and some do
and what else and he spilled his tacks twice and he just and the first time he didn't know what to do and the second time he knew exactly what cause he had a magnet thingamajig uhm
i forget what they're called uhm

that gave
me an idea
maybe louis wasn't growing fast because he didn't eat
the right food kittens eat food
they grow very fast maybe if mom fed louis kitten food
he'd grow fast too mom didn't like that idea kitten food is for kittens
she told me you
and louis need people too
people to grow you need
from
each of the four food
grapes
what
are the four
food groups mom i asked one group
is
dairy foods like milk and
cheese
and second
group
is meat and chicken and fish eggs and nuts are in the meat group
too the third group
is breads in
c cereal
and the fourth group is fruits and vegetables
i thought about the problem with louis maybe he did not eat enough he could never grow just eating baby food
louis
should eat the same foods that i eat maybe
he would grow faster i said
he only has two teeth
and
he can't chew
well i didn't think of that
louis only has two teeth
it can't be
fun
being a baby ev
even for louis i eat all the things that make me grow
i like the foods i eat maybe the problem with luis is that
he's a baby
he can't do anything about it soon he'll grow then he'll
be the real kid
just like me until then i'll put with
my kittens
uhm
louis doesn't eat very much
and that uhm
he only has two teeth
and he has a brother
that's uhm smart and tries to solve the problem sorta
why louis doesn't eat very much
uhm
a little scared
maybe
he can't play and he d can't do very many things when he can't eat a lot when he doesn't eat a lot

greedy dog
illustrated by kim kelly
what a greedy
great time
i'll have
eating this meat when i got home said bill
the dog he began to cross a stream of water
he stopped suddenly
and looked down
into the water
there was another dog
looking back at him
from
inside the stream
hey
he
has a bigger
wait
piece
of meat than i don't
said he said i want
that piece
and i'm going to get s it
bill
gr
growled
but the dog
in the water did not move
he didn't
didn't
drop
his meat
either
bill stir
stared stared
very hard at the dog in the water
scare him
the other dog would drop his meat
bill
barked
at the
dog
in the water he was soon sorry
for that because he
because the meat slipped from his mouth
and sank and
and to the bottom of the stream
the
dog in the water lou
lost his meat
at the same time
and
poor
bill went home hungry
end
once a long time ago there wa were no pink roses
all there rose
in
the world were white
there
weren't any red
ones any yellow ones or any pink ones there were only white roses
very early one morning a little white rose bud
w woke up she saw the sun look at her
he started too h
hard heard that the little white rose didn't know what to do
so she she looked up at him and said why are you looking at me so hard
because you
are so
bright she
pretty said the big round sun
and the little white rose
blushed
she
turned
turned
pink after that all her
children
were little pink roses
a dog found a piece of meat and he went to the stream and he looked down
sil
and uhm he saw a different dog and he was he thought it was a different dog trying to steal his own meat so he tried to steal his
sil
ok uhm and then he dropped his own meat the dog but it was really a reflection of his own self and he thought it was a different dog so
<br>
and so he dropped his meat
it was about uhm a rose roses were only like uhm
<br>
white and there are no red no blues no any color except for white
<br>
and then the s then the sun said you are so beautiful one morning and then then the rose uhm blushed and all her children were uhm pink and it was very cool
why did panda with the beautiful girl name yin yin had her changed to the very beautiful girl name columbus if was fred's idea so let's begin with fred
fred fed the panda bears and the tigers and the turtles the turles weren't so bad but as for the tigers he wasn't so sure
he didn't mind handling the raw meat and
the raw meat he had to feed to the tigers his main
his main objection was the to being eaten
s no one could blame fred really since no one really wants to be eaten
so being eaten was definitely not something he looked forward to each afternoon at three o'clock when it was time to feed the tigers
so for fred when it came to pandas he had a warm spot on his heart actually it was
eighty five point five degree spot on his left kidney b
but the point is that
he was very fond of the feeding pandas
there were three pandas and they were known as the panda pan family
they were in order of cuteness yin yin
the young
many people know that pandas eat bamboo
a lot of it a lot of bamboo can get v
quite heavy so because
of the pandas fred became very strong
and was in terrific shape
but
physical fitness was not the only reason that fred loved pandas the other reason was that anyone who gets within
three feet of a panda
automatically falls in love with them
it's a law of nature
at
further distances pandas have a strange
almost magical effect on
human beings
which
makes
us want to hug and squeeze
things
fred was not allowed to actually hug the panda bears since that
could
be dangerous so all of the people at the zoo would know the pandas had been
fed wh when they saw fred
hug
ing
the rather un cuddly palm trees
outside of the panda's home
it is interesting to point
out at this time
that more stuffed panda bears
are sold at zoo gift shops then all of the other stuff animals
combined
this can almost be certainly
be announced for by stay for
by stain
t almost magical effect on the pandas possess
but everything
was not all bamboo
and hugs at the zoo
one morning fred was feeding yin yin and said
oh yin yin i wish
that more people
would come
to visit the zoo
i know i shouldn't be telling you this but we might have
to sell
you and your family to the big zoo
in s san angeles
if you were
if
we don't get more money
it's not that you aren't selling enough stuffed panda bears
it's
just that there hasn't haven't
been enough people coming to see you in the first place
i think
what a zoo needs is a great
anniversary
anniversary
comedian
fred was starting to feel
the
uncomfortable
urge
to the hug of
the panda
so before he ran off to hug the palm
tree quickly said
it costs too much if you feed panda bears i would hate if
you had to leave us after all
it's the only
home
you know
besides if you leave
i'll get terribly out of shape
now if you excuse me i need to squeeze something before i scream
but yin yin the young panda
was not
listening to fred
she was talking to her best friend maggie
the magpie about going to the moon
yes the big one in the sky
that is
most likely not made of cheese and most certainly not to be made of bamboo
yin yin
her best friend maggie
and her best friend maggie
the panda
magpie
who looked a lot like
a panda
would look
if pandas
were birds
were
birds
were discussing about
going to the moon
her mother and father knew
what
they were talking about since they hadn't thought
or talked
of much else since yin yin said i want to go there and pointed to the moon
enough a
of this nonsense said yin yin's mother poo poo
what sort of nonsense
is this fa for a young
panda bear
going to the moon indeed nonsense your job is to be cute
so people won't run to the gift shop and buy and bear dolls it's simple economics
like or not
we are spokes
people with panda stuffed animal
in
and dirty industry
which young lady help
pay for the bamboo and that you eat
such nonsense going to the moon said her mother poo poo
but i just learned how to make myself into a ball
and roll two days
ago
and i've it been
becoming
very good at it
i don't think it will take that long to roll there
said yin yin
yin yin's father
moo man
didn't think it was very proper
or wise
with there
where
places where there wasn't any bamboo
but he was supportive of his young daughter and showed
his support by taking a nap
before he fell
fell to sleep
he did manage to say i believe rolling
in a
decently round
about way to go
if you must go it be best to fly nonsense said
the mother
i'm so mad i'm
going
to look at that lady over there
and make her want
her son cheeks
she said spitefully
an instant later
a young boy was heard saying ouch mom cut that out
i'm sorry
to say but
many little boy's cheeks have been of raw
when mother poo poo panda was upset
yin yin w was always one
to take good good advance of h
her father
and less than a week later yin yin and maggie had built a rocket ship out of bamboo bamboo is very workable success
and pandas tend to handle i bamboo
a lot
so it s
this
in itself will not
that
<unk>
at least
to the yin yins parents fred
sure was impressed though
the main
ob
obstacle
it turns out was getting the rocket ship
off the ground maggie
figured that
if her
and the three of the strongest
magpie friends were to the each grab hold of corner
of the rocket ship they could all fly
to the moon
so they tired one two three to the moon
they said together pulling
with all their might
i see you wings flapping
but we don't seem to be going anywhere
said yin yin
hmm heavier than i thought
i think we need more magpies
said maggie yes but how many more
yin yin said i'm not sure exactly replied maggie
the father watching this all through one eye
for he always had at least
one eye
asleep at all times
said
she wanted
be my best to ask the owl
then closed his eye
so maggie flew
to the owl and asked
t
for his advice
oh wise owl i have a question
that i fear only you can answer she said
how to turn your head
all
the way around
without getting a terrible pain in your neck said owl
no
how many magpies would be needing to fly a four hundred pound panda bear and one hundred pound bamboo rocket ship to the moon
said maggie
the owl instantly
replied two hundred thousand and seventy six
give or take two
a week later maggie managed
to round up two hundred thousand and seventy eight magpie
she could be a very
pers
t
little bird
when she wanted
a week later des
despite
much flapping
they were still trying to get out get
the rocket in the air
it turns out that owl didn't take
into
consideration
that
once you get over one thousand magpie together they tend
attend
turns out
that
owl didn't take
consideration that once you get over a thousand magpie together they can tend to fly flight and can't agree on
a single thing single thing
now while all
was going on
the what
do you supposed fred
was doing
why he
he was feeding the pandas
like what he was supposed to
so one day after fred
had fed the pandas
and were hugging the palm tree
the zoo manager
came up to him
and said what is going on with your pandas fred i've never seen anything like it
it's taken me a couple of weeks to figure it out
i think yin yin wants to go to the moon
and
the magpies want to take her there said fred
oh well that makes sense then
said the manager
did you know that since the little panda built
that bamboo rocket ship
and those magpies started fluttering
about the zoo's
profits have gone up just four thousand
percent
this is just type of
exposure we needed
those panda's will
be
with us for a long time fred thought about it and said you think
you
know that
<unk> yin yin
columbus the zoo keeper said good heavens
man that is great
is a great idea
no wait a second
i
second i don't understand
well sir when columbus set
set out
on his ship
he really t tried to find a quicker way to get around
europe in order to improve trade
he wanted a business man
but instead became a great explorer
yes but
why does that have to do with pandas man said the zoo manager well it seems to me miss
me sir that yin yin wanted to be a great explorer
and instead
a business woman
i see fred
one more thing sir
about those magpie mag
pies flying around
about fly flying above the pandas do you think
that zoo
could be purchased
me an um
the zoo manager laughed and walked away but did purchase a fashionable yellow umbrella for fred the next day
back at the panda's home
back at the panda's home
it wa
the mother panda poo poo
was very proud of her daughter
after all
if it weren't for yin yin they would
have to had
to move from their wonderful home but later
when fred walked into
panda's home
under
under his new yellow umbrella
all
she could think was to say nonsense as for yin yin
she was very proud
to re
re renamed
after a fabulous explorer
and she and maggie never stopped trying to get to the moon
some pandas and the daughter she did some wonderful things
sil
didn't want to move to a different house
cause she did lots of stuff
sil
yeah she wanted to go to the moon and her mom tr kept they tried to get there
sil
yin yin and maggie tried to get there
no
i hate black feathers
no matter how
shiny said a
proud crow
i want to be a
peacock
barnyard where he found some feathers
from a peacock
he picked those up with his
bill
and
placed them
in his own
feathers
then he
danced back
and
forth
looking
at
the peacocks
came
into the yard
they don't did not know what to do
thing
think at first
then
they saw that the crow was trying to
dress
and act the
like they did
they f
they flew at him calling
away
with the
cheat
away
with the
cheat
cheat
they pulled out
the all the
peacock feathers
and many of his black ones
the crow was glad to get away alive
he flew back
to his own family and
old friends
but one of the crows
had seen
him in the barnyard and told the others how silly he had been
acting
where have you been they cried
we will
we know we know we
will not have you in this
flock
away and they drove him away even the
owls
whom he had always
hated
made
eyes
at him
and
screamed
che
ch
sheet
he flew into the forest
there in a s
tree by a
pound he l
lived a lonely life
the tree
toads learned their
funny song's
from him
this is
his
warn warning to them
don't
don't cheat
don't
don't be
cheat
sil
he lived with a bunch of crows and he went to this barn
sil
and he stuck these peacock feathers into him
so he'd look like a peacock
and he went out into the yard and these uhm peacocks they pulled out his feathers
sil
some of his black ones too
sil
and
sil
then he went home
sil
and then he got sent to this other place
lois and sam were reporters for the kids science newsletter
they studied their new assignment it's a tough one
sam and lois have to write an article about sight
eyesight sam asked
one of our senses that shouldn't be too hard
that
that's not the problem lois replied
the problem is when
we are we going to
have time to do it
it's due on monday
today is friday right and tomorrow is a field the field trip to the zoo
zoo
with ms gordon
she
added sam
maybe
we won't be able to go to the zoo tomorrow lois said sadly on the
on their way
out of school lois and sam met ms gordon why do you have such gloomy faces
asked
she asked
aren't you excited about the field trip tomorrow
that's the problem sam told her we
we r
really want to go but we have work to do
we have really
write an article about eyesight so we won't have
to go so we won't have time to go to the
zoo added lois ms gordon smiled oh that's no problem you can
visit the zoo and learn about eyesight sh too
she said we'll meet
at the zoo at ten o'clock
don't be late sam and lois
looked puzzled
how could
they do research
about eyesight in the zoo but they both agreed it was
worth a try
on saturday morning lois and sam and ten other students met ms gordon
at the zoo gates hi ms gordon
ca every
called everyone is here so let's go
but ms gordon lois said
we're still
we're still not sure how we can find facts about eyesight here
i'm sure you
two
will think of some ms gordon smiled here's the snake house sam and lois followed
the group
into the snake house
they stopped in front of the windows
lois looked through the windows
what snakes do you see she asked
i don't see much answered sam
they were turning away
they were turning away when lois said wait
i saw something moving
out of the corner
of my eye
right there a near a big rock
of long black snake
it's of
it's a black mamba
said sam said reading the sign below
he looked at lois she seemed
she seemed to be thinking
i saw that snake out of the corner of my
eye she said slowly
that's called
per
finished sam
th to see things our si
being able to see things
th at our sides
right continued lois
<unk>
pull vision is
a fact we can put in our article yes said sam
and
we can see things that move that s
a second fact we can put
in our article this article won't be
so hard to write
lois was about to agree but instead she pointed and
into another cage look sam it's a big fat snake
where sam asked i don't see it
right there
she said
lying in the grass it's hard to see because it's green like the grass
but the snake is dark
and is dark and the grass is light green
oh i said it
oh i said
it now
oh i see it now
hey those are t
two more facts about eyesight
we can see things that are dark and light
and we can see
color said sam
lois pointed to another cage
i reco
<unk>
i recognized
this snake she said
it's a king cobra i looked
i and looked at sam
way down at the other end of the snake house it's a giant boa constrictor
i really
want to get close
that looks like a snake
but said lois
that's another eyesight fact
we can see things that are near and far
now we
have a lots of facts about eyesight let's go
s s see the boa constrictor
it's my favorite snake
at the
at the end of the day lois and sam thanked ms gordon you were right
ms gordon said sam
we did
our work and
had fun at the zoo
and you learned a lot about one of the senses ms gordon replied your eyes are very important they take in
they take in light and send message about
the light t to your brain messages about color movement and distance
lois asked yes said ms gordon
and
whether something is beside us that's when
we can use
her
per
vision vision added sam
yes that too smiled ms gordon
can
you name the other four senses hearing tasting lois began smelling and feeling finished sam
as they walked away from the
zoo gates lois said i had fun did you sam
you bet sam answered
i can't wait until our next assignment
sil
they they there they're they have this project and
<br>
and they want to go to the field trip to the zoo but they still have work but they but uhm mrs gordon their teacher tells them that they can do both at the zoo like have fun and do the project that they have them finish and they learned a lot and they had fun and then at end of the day they

jeff gripped the chain with one quick push off the pedal the chain wrapped around the gear
there he said to his friend mike now try it
mike rode the bicycle down the driveway and circled back toward jeff
jeff
gee thanks he said it's like a brand new bike jeff grinned he liked fixing things then he looked up just in time to see his new puppy running up the hill
mom he cried there goes puddles can we go after hi him on our bikes
jeff's mom looked out the window yes but come home in time to do your homework remember you must turn
in your ideas for your science fair project tomorrow
now do i
do i push next now
the boys jumped on their bikes and headed
up the hill they saw puddles up ahead
his golden ears flopped up and down as he ran over the hilltop the boy pushed the boys pushed harder on the pedals as they climbed the steep hill
change your gears mike yelled jeff
jeff watched as mike's as mike's chain slipped over a larger gear
at the top of the hill the boys stopped to catch their breath
mike was puzzled jeff why did shifting make it easier to pedal
i don't know it's just got something to do do with the gears answered jeff
i'm just glad he wo that we won't need to pedal so hard going down the hill
the boys looked down the hill below they could see the roller coaster in the new amusement park
the park was called fun station look at those hills mike i i'll bet we could need some big gears i bet we would
need to big gears to climb climb up and strong legs too added mike
jeff looked down at the fun station fence
there was puddles digging under the gate oh no he groaned mom said that
fun station was off limits until it opens next summer
the boys coasted down the hill all their uphill pedaling paid
paid off jeff wondered how fast they were going
and he imagined how fast they could go on the roller coaster
jeff and mike squeezed their hand their hand brakes to slow down when they reached the fence jeff dropped to his knees he peered through the hole
puddles was nowhere in sight
puddles pud puddles mike and jeff shouted but puddles did not return then over the sounds of the workers they heard a familiar bark
uh
from the other side of the fence a woman spoke have you lost your dog yes cried jeff do you have puddles well said the woman i don't know if it's if it's puddles but i have a friendly little cocker spaniel here that's puddles cried jeff can you
make him come back through this ho the this hole the woman laughed here it be easier for puddles puddles if i open the gate
in a few minutes puddles was in jeff's arms jeff hugged him hard puddles wiggled to get free but jeff wasn't about to let him escape again
jeff looked up the
woman thank you for bringing puddles out no th no problem said the young woman my name's lisa i'm one of the engineers building the great gravity machine i was playing with puddles when i heard you you call
what's the great gravity machine asked jeff a that's the name of the roller coaster lisa pointed toward the big steel steel hills
wow it's huge said mike
i can see why they call it great but why about but what about gravity
well gravity is a force a force pushes or pulls things explained lisa
on a roller coaster the cars wraps are attached to a chain that wraps around gears
when an engine turns the gears the chain pulls the cars up the h first it first hill the first hill is always the highest one
when cars reach the top the force of gravity pulls them down the hill
when they reach the bottom the cars are going fast is enough to get up the next hill by themselves
by themselves
yeah jeff nodded gravity is why we
coasted so fast down the hill the hill on our bikes that's right lisa replied your bicycle and the roller coaster both use gravity
but there there is one big difference your bike has pedals the roll coaster cars have no pedals and no engine
the roller coaster is made of several s several simple machines simple machines have only one or two parts
one simple machine is an inclined plane
that's just another name for a ramp
a ramp is a machine asked mike
sure said lisa a machine is anything that helps you do things more easily suppose that you had to climb straight up from the ground to the top of the roller coast of that roller coaster hill
that would be tough said jeff it is much easier for roller coaster to climb a ramp then
than go to go straight up explained lisa then mike had an idea our bikes go up hill
go up hill are they machines
lisa nodded your bike your bike is made of several simple machines the pedals help you turn the wheels the pedals are part of a simple machine called the wheel and axle
the hand brakes are simple machines called levers how about the gears asked mike you're right gears are also simple machines answered lisa
just then puddles jumped from jeff's arms
jeff
jeff caught the puppy and cl and clipped on his leash i guess puddles thinks it's time to go home laughed jeff
jeff
puddles
pulled at his leash while the boys thanked thanked lisa
you're very welcome she said come back this summer and let me know
how you like the roller coaster ride
as the boys turned home mike thought about his homework i know what i'm going to do for the science fair he announced i'm going to figure out how the gears work on my bike jeff smiled he planned to b to build a roller coaster for his car collection he'd call it the little gravity machine
the greedy dog illustrated by kim kelley
what a great time i'll have
eating this meat when i get home said bill the dog he began to cross a
cross a stream of
he stopped suddenly and looked down into the water and another dog looking back at him from inside the stream
hey he has a bigger piece of meat than i do he he said i want
i want that piece and i am and i'm going to get it
bill growled but the dog in the water did not move he didn't drop his meat either
bill stared very hard at the dog in the water bill thought if that if he c that if he could scare him that the other dog would drop his meat
bill barked at the dog in the water he was he was sorry for that
because meat slipped from
his mouth and sank to the bottom of the stream the dog in the water lost his meat at the same time and poor bill went home hungry
they learned that uhm like sort of a ramp might be a is a simple machine pedals are simple machines and other stuff is just like simple machines and so they have so basically they le and they also learned about gravity too that gravity helps like pulls things down and if we sort of didn't have gravity right now we we would be floating up in air
uhm well bill the dog basically he was he basically was barking at his shadow thinking that i mean the reflection in the water and he was thinking that that it had a bigger meat and so he was just barking at him staring at it trying because its his reflection looked like it had a bigger piece of meat and he he was just thinking hey that d that dog has a bigger piece of meat i want that meat so so basically he's just barking at it and starting at it and trying and he has no idea that's just his own reflection
sil
and so and then finally he he barks at it and he drops his meat and it sinks to the bottom of the stream and he has to go home hungry without his meat

once a long time ago there was a farmer
he had a pretty horse and a small donkey
the horse always had lots to eat a and had a bath every week
the donkey had to eat trash and was very dirty
one day both animals got ready to go to the market
the farmer put a saddle on the horse
he put two big sack
of food on the donkey
the donkey was a very good animal
he worked hard and never complained
but this morning
he didn't feel good his legs were
weak
under the leg
bags
the donkey asked
the proud horse would you help me today
i feel too sick to carry this food
if you will help me i will soon be well and able to go
the horse held
his head very high while the donkey was talking
then he said you lazy boy i don't want
to help you
i won't carry bags like a donkey no i will not take
any of your load
the donkey had to stop he fell to the road he could not get up again
at the end of the
day the horse got to the market
every bone in his body hurt
he was so tired that he could not walk
if only he had helped the donkey
once upon a time a tort
tortoise lived in a po pond with two ducks
they were her very good friends she likes
liked
the ducks she could talk with them as much as she liked
the tortoise liked to talk she liked the sound her of her voice
the tortoise and the ducks lived to
together for a long time then the pond ran out of out of water the ducks and
the tortoise had no water to swim in
the two ducks could not live
without water
they were going to fly away to more water
they went to the tortoise to say goodbye
oh don't leave me said the tortoise
take me with you i will die if i stay here but you
you can not fly said the ducks how can we take you with us
take me with you take me with you said the tortoise
the ducks felt bad
they had an idea
of how to take her
we have a way to take you
they said
but you must not move
wi
we will each take on end of the st on end of a stick
you take the middle in your mouth
then we will fly up in the
in in the air with you
but don't n
do not
to talk
if you open your mouth you will fall
the tortoise said she would not say a word
she would not even move her mouth
she was very happy so the ducks got a strong stick
and held the end
the tortoise bit the middle
away with their friend
they were high over the trees
the tortoise wanted to say how high we are but she could not talk
the stick was in her mouth she so she kept still
they saw a pretty house she wanted to say what is that but she kept quit
quiet
then they came to a town
people looked up at
up and saw
saw them
look at the ducks carrying a tortoise sa they said everyone r ran to look
the tortoise wanted to say be quiet
but she did not
that is funny look at
look at it
look they said
the tortoise forget to stick
she opened her mouth to say hush
she fell to the ground
that
that was the end of the tortoise
it is very good to be able to be quiet
uhm the donkey was really tired to carry the bags
sil
and
sil
donkey asked the horse can help me and
sil
horse didn't help donkey and the farmer came and the farmer put the do donkeys back to the horse
sil
and the ducks said good bye to tortoise and the tortoise don't want to miss the ducks and they the ducks carry the h tortoise but the tortoise held the stick with mouth but she can not speak and the ducks flew in the sky and they saw a pretty house and the

maya walked slowly from the spaceship and took a deep breath
matter
each year they got a different problem
they had to solve the problem to enter the next grade
maya opened her envelope and read her problem
you must find three forms of water
hint use what you know about matter
hmmm maya said she spoke to her robot computer
define matter the robot computer buzzed and blinked
words appeared on its screen matter anything that takes up space and has mass well maya thought
i know that
water takes up space and has mass so water must be matter
maya heard her teacher ms wong her voice came from a loudspeaker on the spaceship get started <unk>
two hours to solve your problems maya opened her map of
at it opened looked at it she circled the places that she thought might have water
then she turned out
on her jet pack waved at the spaceship and flew off
as she flew
maya thought about her problem i must find
three forms of water what water is matter can matter have more than one form again maya spoke to her robot
<unk>
screen flashed it <unk> matter can be a solid a liquid or a gas what is water is matter maya thought it must have three forms too i must find water as a solid liquid and a gas i know where there's
liquid in water
she flew to the lake of tears and landed on its shore
she looked
she took a jar from her pack and from
and the robot filled it that's liquid water she said
now i need t the two other forms maya checked the map and flew toward the frozen mountains
maya arrived at the frozen mountains and landed at the bottom of the an ice cliff
she shut off her jet pack and p spoke to her robot question what is ice the robot blinked ice solid it is frozen water
a rock and broke off a piece of ice she dropped the ice into a plastic bag now i need
to find the third form of water she thought what can it be
she looked at the map again but both slimy swamp and steaming springs looked like good places to find water steaming springs was closer
i'll go there first maya decided she turned on the jet pack and flew off to the springs time was running out
maya landed in steaming springs she spoke to her robot once again question what is steam the ro robot buzzed steam is a gas it is water in a gas form steam is the third form of water
i've found it maya told the robot fill
to fill a plastic bag with steam the bag filled like a balloon maya sealed the mouth of the bag
now back to the ship she cried when maya got back to the ship ms wong was outside waiting for her she smiled
oh maya i was worried about you did you solve your problem yes ms wong replied maya
it was easy really the teacher asked yes maya said i learned that
matter has three forms solid liquid and gas
water is
matter
i found three forms of water to solve my problem
maya opened her pack she pulled out
the jar here is liquid water then she took out a plastic bag here is steam the gas
the gas maya w
and here is steam the gas maya was shocked
the plastic bag didn't look like a balloon anymore it held only a few drops of water
what about the third form asked ms wong
maya didn't know what to say
the other plastic
bag held only liquid water too what happened she cried i really did find three different forms of water now i have only one
ms wong laughed it's ok maya
you you've learned something else about matter
when you heat or cool matter it can change form heat melted the solid ice the steam cooled and became liquid you mean
i passed
asked maya in surprise yes you did answered ms wong maya ran happily into the spaceship
she was wondering what
next year's problem
would be
uh uh maya solved the problem it's about uhm
<br>
uhm there's three forms of water no wait uhm so this little girl named maya uhm she had to solve a problem s uhm about like there's three forms of water so first she went to uhm
sil
uhm the liquid and which is regular water and then she went to solid which is ice frozen water and then she went to
sil
she solved the gas water which is steam water vapor and then when she went back she found out that uhm uhm

the ice the solid melted and the

blinding ambers tell me true where are these armies marching to and what the burning city is that crumbles in your
furnaces furnaces
since dear mom and dad parents since you have
grounded me and told me to write down why i am sorry before i was alone out of my room i am
mad at you are i
won't like to start by saying that i think
that you
are very mean to make me do this because it wasn't even my fault i couldn't help it anyway it was an accident and i
didn't even do it on purpose i really didn't mean to shave the cat really i swear
ok here's what happened as i remember it i saw
that the cat was trying to get
the
gerbils gerbils and
you told us to
you use
we couldn't hit animals so i didn't know what else to do so i grabbed dad's nose
hair clippers and shaved it
you shouldn't be proud of me for thinking so fast
on my toes or sure it's easy to say that i should have just picked the cat up and but something we don't always think all that great under
pr
pressure and you know what these stupid gerbils didn't even thank me
they just ran and
on the s
wheel
and did stupid things that's the last time
i sh
a shave the cat to protect any stupid gerbils
beside the real reason i shaved the cat was to keep it nice and cool i just didn't want to see the cat
getting all hot and uncomfortable and stuff
you gaze will just probably say it's winter
danny cats don't
overheat in winter
but so what if it's winter
i mean it's be summer soon enough and i just want
the cat
to guess
using to the ideas before it
got really hot plus oscar my turtle told me to shave the cat
b
talk
but if he could he she would have said please shave the cat it keeps hitting me on the shell
and trying to roll me over
when you leave the room you guess never like oscar as much as the cat
anyway you wouldn't always take the cat's side if you side knew the stuff he didn't did to me my poor turtle
cat's aren't always nice just like my sister jenny isn't always nice
but the real reason
i shaved the cat was to make a wig for those poor was hairless cats
that we saw on t v on the animal channel i knew our cat would grow her fur back
but her hairless cat and they need fur in
the winter sometimes i think i swear that's the reason also i was going to sell the cat fur and buy my sister jenny s jenny
aces for her big stupid face
plus i forgot to tell you that
you should be blaming mrs
not mrs casper
my science teacher she m made us shave something for science ask her she said that
went when
her shave hair it grew back
ha
<unk>
and something even darker
so i thought that i if i could shave the cat
a lot of a bunch of times her hair would grow back
i do each time and soon she would have an invisible coat of cat fur armor
then she would
be a super cat
on your
could take her on t v
shows and get
lots of money so that you can send jenny to college
even if she is a dumb little tattle tale
she's
so good at school and you bought her a cat
cause she's so responsible and stuff
that she didn't brush her teeth
oh yeah i forgot
you that mom and dad jenny didn't brush her teeth last night i think that she should brush her teeth twice
tonight
that's just my
op
oh
what
opinion
so
drew i'll get you didn't know something else
did you know that i want
ed to do a barb
i was afraid to tell you the really reason i sha shaved the cat was that i went want to be a barber and i needed
practice i was afraid you wouldn't let me practice on my own head can i
then i did on the cat cause now i have
went dad called life
ex
and st
not that i shaved the cat
th
actually
the truth is that i by
accident turn on the nose hair clippers and the cat was being chased by the turtle and ran right by the clippers and shaved herself i kept saying no kitty
no don't shave yourself
but my stupid sister never thought her cat how to listen so
she just ignored me she says not so responsible after all
if i had a cat i wouldn't teach it
to not shave itself that's for sure
have you got good grades to know if you should teach a cat
to shave itself
plus if you were always cuddling with my sister so much maybe she
would
have been with her cat
instead
the cat came into my dad and because jenny never plays with it enough
the cat likes being
saved away so i don't
see the big deal i think it really like its haircut the only reason it hasn't come out for two weeks is because you it guys made sure a big deal about it poor kitty
this
this and poor kitty
that it's
your fault really dad please don't read the next part
dear mom don't let dad know that the real reason i shaved the cat
was that he's always sneezing around it
i know how much you get him always sneezing and stuff so i thought if i got rid of his fur he wouldn't sneeze and that
you would have a better
<unk> so i it really
so it was really my father
father's day
gift to him so i couldn't buy him
anything nice since you took away my allowance for when i shaved the neighbor's dog
how come jenny's gets
a cat and i get a stupid turtle anyways turtles don't do anything except poke their heads out and be not cuddly can i get a dog please so in conclusion i'm getting hungry and i'm sorry for shaving the cat
all oh you can see that it's really jenny's fault for not being as responsible as you always say and not brushing her teeth p s if you could
have bought her a turtle
i couldn't have shaved it sincerely danny
about an army and it's in the fireplace it looks like
uhm this boy gets in trouble because he shaved his cats
uhm he's blaming it on jenny his si little sister
uhm
sil
and he says if uhm you would have he uhm is blame and he also blamed it on his dad well he said it's his dad's uhm father's day gift because he it sounded like he was allergic to the cat
start here
a long
a long low sound awoke
aw

from his dream

honked honk
the sound
stopped
all next
all newt next

the foghorn
honked again why do they need
a horn to tell us it's foggy he asked
we can see the fog
aunt helen laughed
the fog doesn't sound to
wait
the foghorn doesn't sound to tell us it's foggy
it sounds to warn sailors about the rocky island
neat
nat said
nat nat said had a
had
are arrived yesterday to spend a week of his summer vacation with aunt helen
she had promised to take him
sailing on
her boat
this fog won't last long she said
the t
the temperature dropped dropped last night
the water vapor in in the
in the air
connect

s connects into water
droplets
that
makes up the fog
soon sunlight will warm the air that will turn the fog
vapor again
fog vapor
again
then we can go sailing
by ten thirty the fog had cleared
no did aunt helen put on
life jackets
they carried the pen
thi their
their
pi picnic lunch in the oar oars down the sandy
path to the to a dock
a
a rowboat drifted from the rope tied to the
rock
to a rock
to the rock
they climbed and
they cl
they cl
they climbed
they climbed in and aunt helen
rowed
to the sailboat
rode
next next
wait they planted
they planned to sail to
to
an island
and its
spend the
day exploring it aunt helen owned a small sailboat
it had
a tr tiny
ca cabin
did you ever want to
did you want did you ever want uhm
<unk>
aunt helen smiled no
she said why not
asked newt
if the wind stops
then you can't go anywhere
are noisy
r
re
repelled aunt helen
i like
the
peace and quiet
of sailing
sometimes there
there's no wind but i know that soon the wind will blow again
that helped raise
the
sail on the mast a pole
rising from the
center of the boat
the sail
command
can
commended
reminded nate of a sheet hanging
on that
clothesline
but that sail was tied to a
<unk>
inside
of
inside a little a <unk>
of breeze slip under it
the way a sheet did
on the sail
the sail caught breeze
cast off the morning line aunt helen said
nate untied the rope
that he held the boat
he could
feel that
feel
he could feel the
boat begin to move
i'm going to teach you to steer aunt helen said
this is the tiller
tiller
you use it to steer the boat
she
pur she pushed the
tiller toward the
left side of the boat
this the front of the
boat moved to that right
next newt moved the tiller toward the
right
the boat turned left
aunt helen moved
to
moved the sail to catch more wind
you see
by
you sail by knowing the direction of the
wind
she said
right now the wind is coming from the ocean
how do you know
newt asked
one way
is to look
at the flag and
town
town dock
aunt helen explained
what if
you're fair from
island and
you can't see the flag
newt asked the tie
i tie a
pencil
a piece of red yarn to my to the top of my
mast aunt helen
pointed to the
pointed up see it
in
it's called
a
a teller telltale
a telltale
this is the
morning
this is the morning
breeze blowing in
from the ocean
in the
in the <unk> s s
evening
the wind blows out
from the
land why does
the wind always go the same
go the same way
in the daytime the ocean is
color
col color than
i am
island so the air above the water
is cooler than the
air above the island
do you know what the cool air
does to warm air asked aunt helen
it pushes out of the way
said nate
right
when the o
when the cool ocean air
pushes the
warm
island air out of the way a breeze blows from the ocean to the island
in the
in the evening
the opposite
the opposite
happens because
the island
cools off
more quickly than the ocean does
when the
cooler air
push
when the cooler air pushes the warm ocean air
out of the way it gets a breeze from
the island the ocean
two hours later the boat
neared the island
and entered a cove
next steered
toward
boat toward
a sandy beach
a sandy
then
aunt helen dropped the
ar
anchor and they waded to shore
after
net net had aunt helen
and aunt helen ate they explored the island
they turned
to the bridge
the beach
late in the afternoon
newt noticed that the air was still there were no wind all at all
what happened to the wind

justin and his hat
one day justin and his mother went shopping for hats and found a perfect one
but justin would never wear the hat and that made his mom roll her eyes
it wasn't that he didn't like the hat
in fact he loved it he thought it was great
it totally fit his head and he loved it the way it was a light
sil
tight a at first but then stretched to the perfect size
he loved the color the size and the shape no the size the shape and the new hat smell
he even liked the way his hair looked when he took that the hat off
sil
unfortunately justin was too smart for his own good he figured out that the hat would get
sil
um dirty or lost if he wore it too much so he made a promise to himself that he would never wear it in it except on special days he wanted that the hat to be
sil
clean and perfect forever
if it gets dirty i i'll wash it s
sil
um wash it silly said his mother
but it'll it'll shrink if you wash it then it will be too small he said
sil
his father said you should really wear the hat if you like it or else you'll be sorry
but justin didn't listen to and everyday the hat sat in a clean clear plastic box so that it wouldn't get dirty
sometimes justin would imagine himself walking around school with the hat
and on his head once he even imagined himself as a grown up wearing the hat and speaking in front of many people
he imagined the people whisper um whispering to theirselves
what a fine speaker he is such a handsome hat
he has a such such a handsome hat too
<br> on his next birthday he decided to wear the hat
there were many presents but the only thing that made justin excited was getting to wear his hat
he went to his room
h room opened the plastic box and took the hat out very carefully then he slowly slid it on
it was a little tight at first like it was supposed t to be
it was just like he remembered
he was so happy that he couldn't help but smile
but then he noticed that it wasn't stretching
<unk> something was wrong with
sil
something was wrong
it was a little tight
justin could tell it just wasn't perfect anymore he knew crying wouldn't help make the hat perfect again but he cried anyway
he told his parents i don't want any of these gifts i want to return them all and try to find a new perfect hat instead
his parents looked at each other and knew that justin had learned a good lesson
soon if we would be happy to buy you a new hat but only if you promise to wear it the father said
justin replied i promise that if we find the perfect hat i will wear it everyday
so the next day justin and his mother went shopping for hats and found the perfect one
um
sil
justin got this new hat that he really liked he'd never wear it because he didn't want it to get dirty
and on his when he wanted to wear it at his birthdays
but it was too tight so he got all mad
and he wanted to return all the presents and get a new hat and he promised that he would um wear it everyday and he did

go when his owners got him as a sil puppy all he wanted to do was run and run so his owners named him racer
when he got older he developed problems with his back legs
every time he ran he would limp but that didn't stop him from running because he like because like most dogs racer loved to run
there was a dog park near where he lived he enjoyed playing at the dog park because he didn't have to be one on his leash
when he was there so he could run as much as he liked
there was one dog at the dog park named fang
he would always come to racer and bite his back leg and run away saying bark bark bark bark
which his <unk> dog talk means you are too slow to catch me that limp of yours
so i am going to pick on you racer would always chase fang but he could never catch him
one day racer went to the vet racer liked the vet because the people in the white coats gave him treats
racer didn't know it but he was at the vet to have surgery to fix his legs
when he woke up from the surgery he didn't even remember where his where he was but soon his owners came and drove him home
w on the drive home racer realized that his legs inched a inched very badly
he thought oh boy i'm going to lick my leg so hard that the itching is going to go away
so he turned his head around to lick his leg but there was a big white thing in its way
he was like wearing a collar that made it impossible to lick his leg
a few days later he went with his owner to the dog park racer had to be on a leash since he still needed to heal from h his surgery
but it was nice to see all his friends
mean old fang said bark bark bark bark which meant why do you have to wear that stupid looking collar it sure looks s silly <unk>
eventually racer didn't have to wear the collar but then his legs didn't t itch so he didn't want to lick them
for six weeks racer would take walks and go to the dog park but he still had to be on his leash sil
one day he took a walk to the dog park and all his friends were there as usual
then his owner reached around his neck and took off his leash just then fang bit him on the back leg and ran away
racer's owner said go run s so racer started running and chasing fang
fang was laughing because he knew racer could never catch him but suddenly he noticed that racer was racer was cas catching up to him
but race racer was running faster than he could ever remember and before he knew it he had caught up to fang and knocked him down racer said bark bark which in dog talk means don't pick on me anymore fang
and from that day on fang never bit racer's leg
racer was so happy that he could run as fast as he ran in circles
<br> finally he ran back to his owners and gave him big kisses for fixing his legs
right now
in this story um there was a dog named racer <br>
and he was always getting picked on by uh other dog named fang <br>
who would always um bark which would always mean something like <br> um i'm faster than you or get off get away from me
or i'm going to pick on you cause you have a bad leg
<br> because he would always bite um racer's leg to make him slow
<br> and then one day his owners um took him to the vet to get it <br> checked and they gave him surgery
and then one time he went back to the park and he his since his leg was healed um
<br> his um fang didn't know that his leg was healed and so he started to run after him and eventually he caught up and knocked him down

one day justin and his mother went shopping for hats and found a perfect one
but justin would never wear that hat and that made his mom roll his eyes her eyes
it wasn't that he didn't like the hat in fact he loved it he thought it was great
it totally fit his head he loved the way it was a little tight at first but then stretched to perfect size
he loved the color the size the shape and the new hat smell
he even liked the way his hair looked when he took the hat off
sil unfortunate unfortunately justin was too smart for his own good
he figured out that the hat would get dirty or lost if he wore it too much so he made a promise to himself that he would never wear it except on special days
he wanted the hat to be clean and perfect forever
if it gets dirty i'll wash it silly said his mother
but it'll shrink if you wash it and then it'll be too small he said
his father said you should really wear that hat if you like it or else you will be sorry
but justin didn't listen and everyday the hat sat in a clear plastic box so that if it so that it wouldn't get dirty
sometimes justin would imagine himself walking to school with the hat on his head
once he even imagined himself as a grown up wearing the hat and speaking in front of many people
he imagined that people <unk> the people whispering to themselves what a fine speaker he is and such a handsome hat too
on his next birthday he decided to wear the hat
there were many presents but the only thing that justin ex excited w made justin excited was getting to wear his hat
he went to his room opened the plastic box and took out the the hat sil out very carefully
then he slowly slid it on
it was a little tight at first
it was supposed to be sil it was supposed to be
it was just like he remembered
he was so happy that he couldn't help but smile
i know it's just a hat he thought to himself but i sure do love it
but then he noticed that it wasn't stretching
sil something was wrong it was a little tight
justin could tell it was just wasn't perfect anymore
he knew crying wouldn't help make it the hat perfect again but he cried anyway
he told his parents i don't want any of those gifts i want to return them and all and try to find a new perfect hat instead
his parents looked at each other and knew that justin had learned a good lesson
son we would be happy to buy you a new hat but only if you promise to wear it the father said
justin replied i promise that if we find the perfect hat i'll wear it everyday
so the next day justin and his mother went shopping for hats and found a perfect one
from then on justin would never take it off and that made his mom roll her eyes
um well justin um got a hat and then he loved it so much
<br> and it was a perfect hat and he liked it so much and didn't want to get it dirty or anything and um
but his mom thought well that that's just kind of wierd cause i could just wash it
<br> and so then but one day justin went to put it on and it didn't fit like it used to when it was new
so he thought that it'd be best if he just returned all the gifts from his birthday
<br> and then sil and then went and got a new hat with his mom
so then they went and got and returned all the um sil gifts from his birthday and got and then they got a new hat
and then <br> sil and then he wore it because he liked it so much and he had learned a lesson that

the slowest t turtle
every four years turtles from all over the land would crawl to the great pond
it would take some turtles from far away village two two whole weeks just to get there
when all the turtles arrived there w was a seven day festival called the shell dwellers festival
<br> where there there was lots of e eating and laughing
turtles could catch up with friends they had not seen since the last festival
everything about the festival was fun but the main event was the great turtle race
<unk> the winner of the great turtle race was so important that he or she didn't have to move for four years until the next festival
the the least a turtle moves the bigger they get and the longer they live
<br> so you so you can see winning the great race is a great honor
<br> the turtle cup was the trophy that the winner would take home to their village
it had been in sludge pond for over fifty years because no one could ever beat their turtle
this was the most famous turtle there was
he was the biggest most respected and also one of the trickiest turtles there was
there were there were many legends about him
it was rumored he was so slow his heart would only beat once a day
when mud was in his prime there was a new turtle born in blue pond
the turtle's name swish
when swish was born everyone thought he was a slow t little slow
but as he got a little older the turtles began to realize that swish was really really really slow
<br> once his mother called him in for dinner and he t and didn't make it home until breakfast the next morning and he was only a foot away
<br> blue pond was a nice village located about three days crawl from the great pond
they all felt a little sad because they hadn't held the turtle cup in over a seven hundred years
so with swish they thought maybe just maybe he could bring back the turtle cup to their their little pond
everyone treated swish differently
for example mister peeks the local shell cleaner would say hey there swish do you want a free shell waxing today
we all want you to look good when you bring home the cup
mrs snapper would say hi hi swishy do you want some yummy pie to fill you up and s and slow you down for the big race a fat turtle is a slow turtle
mister peeks would never do anything for free but he was g going to give swish a free shell waxing
this was the kind of thing that swish would get all the time
all the extra attention made swish very uncomfortable
he thought sure they are nice to me but because they think i can win the race but if i lose they'll be disappointed and mad at me
i would never promised that i would win the race i can't beat mud anyway
i heard once it took him three days just to yawn
so one day he told his parents i don't want to race
all the turtles in blue pond held a meeting to d to discuss the problem
the mayor doctor softshell said this is ridiculous swish has to race he's the slowest turtle i've every seen except for mud of course
without him we don't have a chance
but he doesn't want to be treated special he just wants to be normal and he doesn't want everybody to hate him if he can't beat mud
you have to remember that even though he's gifted at being slow he's still very young said swish swish father
we never thought of that they all they s they all said
the town agreed to treat swish like a normal turtle and after a while swish decided that he would be proud to race for his village
when the time of the festival drew near all the turtles in the land started toward great pond
swish had a had to be carried on his father's back
since it would have to take him months to get to the great pond by himself
finally after the long journey all the turtles arrived at great pond
look there's your cousin peek a boo from big puddles' village said swish mother swish mother
you'll you'll get to meet all sorts of new turtles
wish was suddenly very excited
he told his mother you know what i'm going to win this race i know it and all these and all these turtles will know that blue pond rules
i'm not afraid of stupid mud mud
swish's mother smiled and said i know that you can win swish but it's an honor just to get to race said swish mother
swish saw a rock in the middle of the field and wondered
how come they don't move that big rock out of the field it seems to be everyone's way said swish
that's not a rock sweetie his mother said that's mud
<br> swish made a loud gulp sound just do your best said his moth mom
swishes father said son i have something to tell you
as you know your great great grand turtle raced mud once he wasn't as slow as you but he did teach me about mud's dirty tricks
then he whispered in swish's ear all the tricks that his great great grand turtle taught him
after seven days of playing and dancing and bug eating finally the day of the race came
the mayor of great pond mrs tort posted the rules of the race on a tree for everyone to see
they read rule number one the great race begins at sunrise and ends at sunset
rule number two all turtles must run as fast as they can and the turtles that that is closest to the starting line wins
rule number three no turtle may pretend to be going fast but go slow instead all turtle must go as fast as they can at all times
since turtles never cheat this is the most important rule to break this rule would mean an end to the great turtle race forever
rule number four do no turtle may fall asleep since if you are asleep you aren't running as fast as you can
swish read the r rules even though he knew them by heart then he heard the mayor say runner's take please take your positions
<br> the slowest turtles from each pond were carried to the starting line by members of their village
there were about three hundred turtles racing they were all the s all the slowest of the slow
the turtles all stretched and thought really thought really slow thoughts
as they did this as they did the sky turned from black to dark blue
they looked at the horizon and saw the sun was starting uhm starting the rise
just then the mayor said ready set slow and off they went
all the turtles were very very slow so it took them time before anyone could figure out which turtle were the slowest
after a few hours most of the turtles have or had gone a few feet all except two
swish and mud were both back at the starting line
it looked as if neither of them had moved at all they were both moving of course but they were so slow that it was hard to tell
after six hours mud and swish were still ti ti tied and had only moved a few inches
by now all the turtles were usually way ahead of mud but this time swish was just as slow
mud knew that this would be his closest race ever and he was actually getting a little bit scared
who was this who is this young punk he thought to himself
mud said to swish there's no way that a turtle as young as you can be so slow
even i was faster than you when i was your age you're cheating you're going to ruin the great race forever
but swish d didn't let mud scare him
you're just trying to to make me quit i'm not going to fall for your tricks he said
turtles never cheat and i'm a turtle with honor
then mud tried another trick he started singing a soft beautiful lullaby
swish started yawning
<br> he was tired from racing and thought he it would be nice to just listen to mud's sweet voice and fall asleep
then he snapped out of it and remembered his fathers father had warned him of his tricks
he reached his shell and pulled out a couple of earplugs
he put the earplugs in his ears and he could hear mud's singing any he couldn't hear mud singing anymore
mud kept singing his lullaby for a few hours but he stopped right before sunset
the crowd thought he had he must have realized that his singing trick wasn't working
but then right at the end right before the sunset swish started to pull ahead of mud
oh no shouted the fans mud's winning it looks like mud is still the greatest turtle of them all
then the sun went down mud was the closest turtle to the starting line
swish was sad that he lost but all the turtles from blue pond cheered for swish
they were very proud he gave mud such a close race
swish was h was happy too but deep down inside he knew he was just as slow as mud
the mayor of pondland went to present the turtle cup to sludge pond again
she announced well mud it looks like you've done it again sludge pond wins the turtle cup again
this time it was a bit closer than you would have liked i'll bet
what would you like to say to all the turtles at the festival
the crowd started yelling speech speech
<br> mud didn't answer the mayor tapped mud on the shell and said hello hello mud
mud didn't answer in fact mud was sound asleep
mud had actually sung himself to sleep
ladies and gentlemen she said mud mud from sludge pond has been disqualified for sleeping during the race
this means that we have a news champion
the real winner is swish softbelly of blue pond the crowd went wild
mrs tort went up to swish and gave him the turtle cup
she said swish you are the youngest winner of the great turtle race that was the most exciting finish we've ever had
i think that you'll be the greatest champion for many years since turtles only get slower with age
for the first time in six hundred years i would like to present the turtle cup to blue pond the crowd went wild again
swish took the cup that d cup that day for the first time
he he would take it many more times after that
it was because of swish that blue pond became the most respected pond in the land
he would never lose the turtle cup for the rest of his life
<br> but though he became the greatest and the biggest turtle all much greater or bigger than mud
he always thought sure that no one treated him special and that he treated everybody like he wanted to be treated
like like a turtle with honor
uh it was about a turtle named swish and uhm he was the slowet turtle and uhm there was a race every
sil
year or something i don't remember <br> and uhm he was going to race against mud who's won <br> uh and won a lot of times and uhm uhm he does a lot of tricks and uhm he sang actually mud himself to asleep and uhm swish won the cup for his pond
sil
uhm because of <br> <unk> because their pond or their city thought he was the slowest and everyone treated him as nice
<br> and uhm they wanted him to race at the shell dwellers festival <br> and uhm he decided not to after a while after they treated him like a like he was like he was gonna win and give him all these treats and stuff <br>
but then after they di like they didn't tell him not to that <br> uh er the father and the mother said that they wo he wouldn't do it uhm they stop giving him treats and stuff
so then he decided to race and uhm his father told him all about the the guy who tr does a lot of tricks and has won a lot of times and his name was mud
and they he was the slowest and he was racing against him
and uhm
sil
uhm all the people from all the other ponds would come and they would celebrate for seven days and eat and laugh <br> and then the race would be uhm on the eighth day
and it would be from sunrise to sunset and uhm
<br>
uhm they would start the uhm and swish and mud and all the other turtles started the race and swish and mud <br> were at the starting line and mud wanted to cheat and uhm say that you'll never beat me and stuff but
uhm swish wasn't scared of him so he kept on racing and then mud sang a song <br> and uh swish also fell asleep but he put earplugs in his ears <br>
and uhm but uhm swish got in front of mud so he lost but mud had fallen asleep he f he sang himself to sleep <br> and uhm swish took home the cup uhm for his pond or his city yeah

the slowest turtle every four years turtles from all over the land would crawl to the great pond it would make some turtles from far a away villages two whole weeks just to get there
when all turtles arrived there it was a seven day festival called the sh sh shell dwellers festival where there was lots of eating and laughing
everything about the festival was fun but the main event was the great turtle race
the win the winner of the great turtle race was so important that he or she didn't have much to move for four years until the next festival the less a turtle moves is the bigger they get and the longer they live so you can see winning the great the great race is an honor
the turtle cup was the trophy that the winner would take home to their village it had been a sludge p for pond for every fifty years because no one could ever beat their turtle
sil
this was the most famous turtle there was
sil
there was he was the slowest turtle of all time he hadn't had to move for fifty years he was the biggest the most respected and also one of the trickiest turtles there was there were many legends about him
when mud was in his prime there was a new turtle born in the blue pond
<br> this turtle is named swish when swish was born every everyone thought he was a little slow but as he got older the a little older the turtles began to realize that swish was really really really slow
once his mother called him for dinner and he didn't make it home until breakfast the next morning and he was only a foot away
the blue p blue pond was a nice village located about three day crawls from the great pond they all felt a li little sad because they hadn't held the turtle cup in over a seven hund in over seven hundred years years so with swish they thought maybe just maybe he could bring back the turtle cup to their little pond
we all want you to look good when you bring home the cup mrs snapper would say hi swishy do you want some yummy pie to fill you up and slow you down for the big race a fat turtle is a slow turtle
mrs snapper was very nice to anyone she was being nice to swish
mister peeks would never do anything for f for free but he was going to give swish a free shell waxing this was the kind of thing that swish would get all the time
all the extra attention made swish very uncomfortable
he thought sure they are nice to me because they think i can win the race but if i lose they'll be disappointed and mad at me
i never promised that i would win the race i can't beat mud anyway i heard once it t it took him three days just to yawn
so one day he told his parents i don't want to race
all the turtles in blue pond held a meeting to discuss the problem the mayor doctor softshell said this is ridiculous swish has to race he's the slowest turtle i've every seen except for mud of course without him we don't have a chance
we never thought of we never thought of that they all said the town agreed to s to treat swish like a normal turtle and after a while swish decided that he would be p proud to race for his village
when the time of the festival drew near all the turtles in the land started toward the great started toward great pond
swish had to be car carried on his father's back since it would have taken him months to get to the great pond by himself finally after the long journey all the turtles arrived at great pond <unk>
sil
this was swish's first ever shell dwellers festival and he thought it was the most wonderful thing he had ever seen there were thousands of turtles all different species all having great time all having a great time
look there's your cousin peek a boo from big puddle village said swish's mother you'll get to meet all sorts of new turtles
i wish a sudden swish was suddenly very excited he told his mom you know what i'm going to win you know i'm going to win this race i know it and all these turtles will know that blue pond rules i'm not afraid of stupid mud
swish's mom smiled and said i know that you can win swish but it's an honor just to get to the race said swish's mom
<br> s swish saw a rock in the middle of the field and wondered how come they don't move all move that big rock out of the field it seems to be in everyone's way swish said
that's not a rock sweetie said his mom that's mud swish made a loud gulp sound just do your best his mom said
swishes father said son i have something to tell you as you know your great great grand turtle raced mud once he wasn't as slow as you but he did teach me l about mud's dirty tricks
sil
then he whispered in swish's ear all the tricks that his great great grand turtle taught him
sil
after seven days of playing and dancing a bug eating finally the day of the race came the mayor of great pond mrs tort p posted the rules of the race on a tree from for everyone to see
they read rule number one the great race begins at sunrise and ends at sunset
rule number two all turtles must run as fast as they can all and the turtle that is closest to the starting line wins
rule number three no turtle may pretend to be going fast but go slow instead all turtles must go as fast as they can at all times
since turtles never cheat this is the most important rule to break this rule would mean an end to the great turtle race forever
rule number four no turtle may fall asleep since since if you are asleep you aren't running as fast as you can
swish read the rules ev even thought he knew them by heart then he heard the mayor say runner's please take your positions <unk>
the slowest turtles from each pond were carried to the starting line by members of their village
there were about three hundred turtle racing three hundred turtles racing
after a few more hours most of the turtles had gone a few feet all except two swish and mud were both back at the starting line
it looked as if neither of them had moved at all they were both moving of course but they were so slow that it was hard to tell after six hours mud and swish were still tied tied and had only moved a few inches
but now all the turtles were usually way ahead of mud but this time swish swish was just as slow
mud knew that this would be his closest race ever and he was actually getting a little bit scared
who is this young punk he thought to himself
mud said to mud said to swish there's no way that a turtle as young as you can be so slow even if was faster than you when i was your age you're cheating you're going to ruin the great race forever
but swish wouldn't let mud scare him you're just trying to make me quit and i'm not going to fall for your tricks he said turtles never cheat and i'm a turtle with honor
then mud tried another trick he started singing a soft beautiful lullaby which started swish started yawning
<unk> he was tired from racing and thought that it would be nice to just listen to mud's sweet voice and fall asleep
then he snapped out of it and remembered his father had warned him of this trick he reached in his shell and pulled out a couple of earplugs
he put the earplugs in his ears and couldn't hear mud singing anymore
the crowd thought he must have realized that his singing trick wasn't working but they all but then right at the end right before the sunset swish started to pull ahead of mud
oh no shouted the fans mud's winning it looks like mud is still getting is still the greatest turtle of them all and when the sun went down mud was the closest turtle to the starting line <unk> the starting line
s swish was sad that he lost but all the turtles from blue pond cheered for swish
but they were very proud he gave mud such a close race swish was happy too but deep down inside he knew he was just as slow as mud
the mayor of pondland went to the president of the turtle cup to sludge pond again
he announced well well mud it looks like you've done it sludge pond wins the turtle cup again
this time it was a bit closer than you would have liked i bet
sil
and that would
sil
what would you like to say to all the turtles at the festival the crowd started yelling speech speech
mud didn't answer the mayor tapped mud on the shell and said hello hello mud
sil
mud still didn't answer in fact mud was sound asleep
mud had actually sung himself to sleep ladies and gentlemen she said mud from sludge pond has been disqualified for sleeping during the race
this means that we have a new champion the real winner is swish softbelly from blue pond the crowd went wild
mrs tort went up to swish and gave him the turtle cup she said swish you are the youngest winner of the great turtle race this was the most exciting finish we've ever had i think that you'll be a great champion for many years since turtles are only only get slower with age
for the first time in six hundred years i would like to present the turtle cup to blue pond the crowd went wild again
swish took up the c took the cup that day for the first time
he would take it many more times after that
it was because of swish that blue pond became the most respected pond in the land
he would never lose the turtle cup for the rest of his long life
but through but though he came to the greatest and biggest turtle of all time much greater or bigger than mud he always made sure that no one treated him special and that he treated li everybody like he wanted to be treated like a turtle with honor
uhm it was about a turtle who was very very very slow and uhm he went to this great turtle race
<unk> and he uhm well you see there was this other guy turtle named mud
and he had always win won the turtle cup race cause he was the slowest turtle
and uhm <br> and but uhm so they raced and uhm it took them like a day to finish the race
uhm it tur uhm mud was uhm well you see all the other turtles got closer to the finish but uhm mud and swish were still at the back
and so they were winning cause its a slow race the slowest person wins
and
sil
then uhm as a trick mud started singing a lullaby
so uhm swish would fall asleep and it's one of the rules that you can't fall asleep during the race cause you'll go slower
and it's in also in a rule that you have to go fast as you can and so if you were asleep you wouldn't be going as fast as you can
sil
and so
sil
but swish outsmarted the trick and put on some earphones earmuffs
uhm and it
sil
later on in the race swish got ahead so that meant mud was winning
sil
and at the end of the race it turned out mud won but uhm mud had sung himself to sleep by the lullaby
and so he he was asleep and that's a rule that you can't be asleep and so it turned out that swish won and oh and everyone was very happy for him

the berenstain bears and the bad habit
sil
sister bear who lived who lived with her mama and papa and her brother in the big tree house down a sunny dirt road deep in bear country had been going to school for quite a while
first there had been a nursery school where which was pure fun playing with dolls blocks rolling clay snakes and scribbling with crayons
next came kindergarten
sil
n next had come kindergarten that was fun too th there were marching games and a rhythm band she also learned a lot of numbers in kindergarten and most of the alphabet
sil
now sister was in first grade regular school was different sh it was still fun and she liked teacher jane very much but it wasn't all f it wasn't
sil
but it wasn't all fun there there was quite a lot of work spelling number problems all kinds of things
in regular school you have to concentrate some some and sometimes when you concentrate you form little nervous habits and that's what happened to some cubs in teacher jane's class
lizzy twirled her fur twirl twirl twirl freddy scratched his head scratch scratch scratch norman sucked his thumb suck suck suck sis and sister nibbled her nails nibble nibble nibble nibble
sil
before she knew it it before she knew it she had nibbled them down to nubbins in fact she nibbled them so far that some of her fingers were getting sore
oh dear said mama mama bear to sister when the cubs got home from school one day you've nibbled your da you've nibbled your nails down to nubbins in fact you've nibbled them clean off
how did it happen i'm not exactly sure mama sister said but some of them are getting sore
hmm said mama well h here's what we'll do we'll put a little m medi medicine on the sores one on the sore ones and bits of ad adhesive tape on all of them that will remind you not not to nibble and get back and will give them a chance to grow back
<br> the the bits of tape helped sister remember remember not to nibble but they a but they also got in the way when she tried to do certain things
it was very hard to hold a pencil with tape all over your fingertips or turn on the tv or scratch when you have an itch when sis when sis and when sister tried to play jacks she couldn't get any
she couldn't higher than
sil
than twosies than twosies
but worst of all bits of tape but worst of all the bits of tape told the whole world sister bear was a nail biter
sil
the next morning when sister lined up for school lizzy bruin and some other others began pointing at her and teasing sister nibbles her nails sister nibbles her nails it didn't take sister long to decide mmm long to decide to it didn't take sister long to decide to pull off those bits of tape
a habit mama said as she pushed the wheelbarrow along the well worn path is something you do so often you don't even have to think about it
habits are very important uh is a habits are a very important l part of our lives most of them are good brushing your teeth and combing your fur when you get up in the morning and looking both ways before you cross a road but some habits aren't so good
like nail biting sister asked you would like to have you ni nice nails grow back wouldn't you was mama's bear was mama's answer
oh yes said sister but i keep forgetting why is it so why is it hard to remember
<br> well said mama it's sort of like this path i've wheeled this barrow over it over it so many times that it's that it's well it's worn a deep rut right down the middle and it keeps getting deeper every time i use it
why it's so deep now i can't i can't get out of i can't get out of it with a li i can't get out i get i can't get out i can't i can't get out of it without a little help
that's that's the way it is with your bad habit more you get use it the harder it is to to get it out of it here this is that i want this is where i want to plant the bulbs
what about my nail biting habit asked sister as she helped mama get out of the deep rut how am i going to get rid of it
sil
get out of it
you just need a little help that's all said mama let's let's plant gran's tulips while i think about it and later i'll talk to your papa he he may have some ideas
i could read the riot act to her suggested papa you know nail biting is an outrageous disgraceful habit and if and if you don't stop it immediately
dear me no said mama nail biting is a kind of nervous habit and shouting at and shouting and threatening will just make her more nervous
i suppose so said papa thoughtfully perhaps some sort of reward would help a bit of money let's say a dime for every day she doesn't bite her nails
sil
before mama before mama could answer sister bear w who had been nervously nibbling in the next room popped in and said a dime ten w whole cents every day for day just for not biting my nails
that's right said papa until the habit's broken
i'll never nibble again she said as she thought of all those lovely dimes she was going to get
but the way it turned out she never she didn't get a single dime all she got was discouraged
a day is a long time and habits are powerful especially bad habits even with the promise of a dime sister couldn't remember not to nibble mama and papa got discouraged too
<unk> oh well sighed mama life goes on i call gran and and thank her for the tulip tulip bulb mm bulbs oh you're very welcome my dear said gran when mama called and how is everything at your house is that so you know i was a nail biter when i was a cub
my mama helped me stop what you ha what have you tried so far uhm uh huh well i think you're on well i think you're on the right track with a dime but instead of a dime and instead of giving it to her at the end of the day
what and interesting idea said mama as she listened to the wise to wise old gr grizzly gran
sil
so they tried gran's idea instead of a dime at the end of each day they they they gave sis sister ten pennies for each nail at the beginning of one for each nail at the beginning of the day ten pennies to keep unless she nibbled
and those pennies and with those pennies in her pocket jiggling when she got on the school bus jing jingling when she jumped rope in the schoolyard just waiting to rem just waiting to be remembered when some nail decided it needed a nibble the plan worked
not perfectly it's hard to break a habit sister had to give back some pennies of the some of the back had to give back some of those pennies but in ten days she had ninety three pennies
sil
but even better she had ten fine fingernails
great for picking things up turning on the tv and scratching itches
and the next time she played jacks when she got all she got all the way up to the tensies
phew said papa bear i'm glad that's over yes indeed agreed mama breathing a great sigh of relief
that's when br brother bear looked at his fingernails and piped up you know i think i might start biting my f nails i could use some money
sil
<br> i could use the money
<br> i certainly hope you're joking roared papa because if you're not i'm joking i'm joking interrupted brother and he was sort of
uhm sister was biting her nails and so they tried to make her stop
<br>
practically and so they would give her a dime at the end of the day but she kept biting her fingernails so they would give her ten pennies at the beginning of the day
sil
so she wouldn't bite her fingernails
sil
<br>
sil
and then they also tried putting tape on her fingernails but everybody laughed at her
sil
so she didn't she took them off and threw them away
sil
<br>
sil
<br>
sil
<br>
that's practically it
sil
<br>
sil
<br>
uhm she stops biting her fingernails
<br> and at the end of like a week she had ninety three pennies
sil
she got ten for every nail i mean like one for every nail that she bit <br>
and still she sat and still she reeled and still she wished for company
now then that is if i tell you the reason i shall instantly die
ah i know said the the dame cli gently fearing to interrupt the story
you certainly are an able minded youngster hiram he observed
after dinner jordan crept up by the way of the back stairs to see her
they journeyed outwards until they almost reached the mountains

well the story was about sister bear and she had a bad habit of biting her nails and she couldn't stop so her parents decided to give her ten nickels at the beginning of the day and if she didn't bite any of her nails she could keep them and if she bought if she bit one of her nails they'd take one away
sil
okay uhm well sister bear when uhm she went to first grade in elementary school she started getting a habit of biting her nails
and th uhm she couldn't stop because bad habits are hard to break and
so her her mom realized that she was doing it and she decided uhm to try and stop and she tried a couple of ideas
uhm <br> like giving her an n nickel at the end of the day if she didn't bite but that didn't work
so when she thanked when sh mama bear called uhm grizzly gran to thank her for the tulips she told gran and uhm gran said
that she should give her ten nickels at the beginning of the day and if she didn't bite them
her if s sister bear didn't bite her nails then she could keep all them but if she if she lost uhm two nickels that meant she had bitten two nails
of hers during the day and uhm by the end of ten days she had ninety three nickels so she only lost seven during that time period
and at the end uhm her habit went away
and still she sat and still she reeled and still she wished for company

diana shook her head gleefully her black eyes dancing with merriment
then he pulled on the hood of his cloak over his ears and over his brow
they shook the floor they shook the flour off her and sat her down on the kitchen floor
i beg your pardon pardon said the learned man it is an old habit with me
she thought saw that she was on the grass and had broken wheel beside her
i know then that if i tell you the reason i shall instantly die
sil
can i look at it this is about a boy named danny who is grounded uhm because he shaved his sister's cat and
sil
he comes up with excuses
like how he wants to be a barber and so he was afraid that his parents wouldn't let him shave his own head
so he decided to shave the cat instead
sil
he also came up with excuses that the teacher made him shave his cat uhm for science
sil
he thought that he could make a wig out of the cat's fur so that he could buy his sister braces and then because she has really bad teeth that's what he says
sil
he says that uh he sh saved it he sh shaved the cat to get rid of his fur because his dad c always is sneezing around it and the mom hates it when he sneezes so he thought that it would be better
sil
then he says that it was just by accident that he shaved the cat that he didn't mean to
that the nose clippers turned on and the cat ran through it and shaved itself
sil
he also says that cat's fur gets harder and thicker everytime that you shave it and darker and so it could make uh armor out of its own fur
and then it could be on tv and then they would get lots of money
sil
so that they could send his sister to college
