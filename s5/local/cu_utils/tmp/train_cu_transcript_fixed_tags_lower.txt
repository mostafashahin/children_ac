little son sat by the river with his mother
he loved to watch the fish swim
the fish swim up the river
i
wish i
were a fish said the little son
fish swim all the time i love to swim little son
time to go home said mother
mother
he said look at the fish
little son and his mother looked
at a fish jump out
over a rock
these fish are salmon mother said they must swim to their home
can salmon go home
he asked
i never knew fish had a home
home is the part of the river where the salmon
hatch said mother
when baby salmon get bigger they swim away to the sea but then
but they always know how to swim home
but why do
they go home little son asked they go home to lay their eggs said mother
this is called
spawning
their eggs must hatch
where there is enough food
baby salmon will come
from the eggs
the babies will hide among the rocks
they will eat bugs then will grow
she told
little son
then she
will swim down the river to the sea
these salmon are found
are four years old they come back to this
river to spawn said mother
i wish i were a salmon little son said i could swim all day it would be fun
it's not always fun said mother
the water in the river flows to the sea but the salmon must swim up the river this is hard work
i wouldn't mind said little son i'd
work hard if i could swim all the time
there are other things that are not fun for salmon mother said people use nets and hooks to catch them
bears try to eat them if i were a salmon
no one could catch me
said little son
look over there said mother little son could
see trash in the water sometimes the water is
ty water makes them sick little son watched the salmon
he wanted to help the salmon
i can't stop people from catching salmon he
thought i can't stop
bears from eating them
i must do something to help
little son ran home he got some wood and
paint he made a sign
oh i so know what he's going to do
mother read his sign what a good idea she said
what a nice thing to do for the salmon little son
mother called other people let's help
son she said let's make the river clean for the salmon
many people
came to help they cleaned up the river they put the trash into the into a truck and took it away
little son pushed
his sign to the river
bank he
looked at the salmon again i really don't want to be a salmon this work
so hard to get home i'm glad you're not a salmon said mother to her little son
was walking and he
finds alot of animals that keep on going with him
in a cow
mmm a horse a cat a lion
a lot of them
that's what i like to do
mmm
about two times
i went fishing once on sunday and now

but i do not like it yesterday i said i hated it it was just
i did not like it
i mostly already knew that
but i didn't know that someone might so generous to put a sign there but i might

kim's plant looked sick the leaves looked yellow
some leaves were gone
what is wrong little plant kim asked
i want you to grow big and strong
maybe mom can help
kim took her plant
to her mother
mom kim said my plant is sick kim's mother looked at the plant
it looks yellow mom said
when my fern
s look yellow i water them
does my plant need water kim asked
yes it gets thirsty just like y you your plant has roots in the soil
roots take in water
mom said oh
kim
thought
my plant needs water
kim took her plant to dad
dad looked at the plant
your plant needs sunlight he said plants use sunlight to make food
the leaves make food for the plant
leaves can't make food without sunlight do you feel bad when you don't eat
oh kim thought my plant needs water and sunshine
kim went to see mr cruz he was working on in his big garden mr cruz she said my plant s is sick
my cruz
mr cruz looked at
her plant
look at my roses
he said
kim looked at the pretty flowers they have
room to grow said mr cruz
they have lots of g of good soil
your plant needs room to grow said he said
the pot is too small
mr mr cruz got a big pot
put your plant in this he said
thanks mr cruz kim said
kim thought about her plant
it didn't get much sunlight to help
it make
to help it make food
her plant must be hungry
sometimes
she forgot
to water her plant
her plant must be thirsty
the plant needed more room to grow
no wonder h he
her plant was sick
kim put her plant in the kitchen sink
she took the plant out of its
tiny pot she put it into the new pot she filled
the pot with new soil kim watered the plant she put it in
the sunny kitchen window kim smiled at her plant
the sh the sun was shining on its leaves
the soil had enough water
the roots had room to grow
her plant looked better already
her plant needed water and s
and g and sunshine and good soil and it needed room to grow
she took it to the neighbor and her dad and her mom to ask what they it needed
when you give water to the plant it sucks it all the way up to the stem and then
it
gets the plant really healthy
cause they had enough room to grow and good soil and water
plenty of sh sunshine
rob wake up said john i saw a star
fall it must have landed behind those trees rob looked out
of the tent
it was very dark the sky was full of stars rob did not see a falling star go back to sleep john
rob said
we'll find that star in the morning
in the morning john looked for
his star rob looked too the boys found nothing let's find dad said rob he
let
he knows about stars
he can help us we need to know more about stars
will
you help us dad asked rob sure said dad tonight we will look at the sky
we will learn more about stars
dad showed the boys a care
a
a chart
this chart showed star
pa
patterns
look at this pattern called the big dipper some people and stars and
call this great beer
why is it great beer
dad gave the star chart to rob then dad
went to build a fire
let's counts
count stars in the big dipper rob said maybe one star is gone
then we will know where
you st
where your star came from
john counted the stars
in the big dipper
one se seven stars he said
rob counted dots
on the chart all stars are there you s
your star didn't fall from the big dipper
the boys counted the stars in other
patterns know where
no were missing
what's wrong boys dad asked
we can't find the missing star said rob
one should be missing said john i saw it fall last night
dad smiled at
dad smiled he
hugged the boys you saw a falling star
falling stars look like stars but they aren't stars
what you saw was an meteorite
meteorite
s meteorite s
are rocks said dad said
when
they fa
fall
to earth they burn up the light you
say was
was a meteor were
burning up
look
look cried john
just then another meteorite a shot across the sky and all the stars were still there
well
well uhm
john
he thought a meteorite was a star
but
really they couldn't see because it was too far
and so it looked
like a star and that would also not make sense
because stars don't fly only meteorites and
things like that
and uhm
uh
well the boys didn't tell their dad yet
and uhm he knew a lot about stars
and like space and stuff
and he
wasn't sure yet so he looked on the computer or something
and like
he
uhm
he found out it wasn't a star

ok
their eggs must hatch where
there is enough food
baby salmon will come from
the eggs the babies will hide
among the rocks

this river
to spawn
and mother
and said mother

that are
not fun for a salmon mother said people use nets
and
hooks to catch them
bears try to eat them
if i were a salmon
no one could catch me said little son
look over there said mother little son could see trash in the water sometimes the water is dirty said

the dirty water makes them sick
little son watched
watched the salmon
and
he wanted to help the salmon
i can't stop people from

many people came to help
they cleaned up the river they put the trash into a truck and took it away
little son pushed his
his sign into

her little son
the boy wants to be a salmon

an old crow
had been looking for water all morning at last he found some in
a pitcher in
a garden
he flew down to it and stuck
in his b bill
bill
but he cou couldn't could not reach the water
he walked over to the other side he tried again he still could not reach he looked
at the cold cool water oh
how tasty
he was
he felt
<unk>
<unk>
i must have that water i'm going to get it he said he started stared his neck into the pitcher
until it was sore but but could h not reach the water he stopped for a second and thought
then said
then he said my beak is strong and
heard
i'll break my
pitcher
so he gave the
pitcher
a hard thump and
it did not break
he
pe
picked
at it first
here and then
there
it did not
even crack
what a strong pitcher it was
this simply wouldn't do he said i have to try my other plan i am big and strong i will tip over tip the pitcher over
he pushed against the pitcher with his chest
it did not move
with his chest in not move
nearby in the garden lay some pebbles
the crow pick
picked up
picked one up
and left
it fall into the pitcher
he dropped in another then
another he could see the water rise
a little now little
rise a little now he
worked harder than
than ever
soon the water
was h
high enough that
he could reach it ho
reach it how wonderful
it taste
he drank as much
as he
wanted h
and flew
away because
he used
his head
and did
not give up
h he
won
uhm
a crow uhm put pebbles
uhm into
uhm drink water
because it was really hot
because he wanted to drink
uhm
what did you say again
ask mom and dad for a brother or sister i want someone to play with i told
he j was just a baby he couldn't do anything we can we trade him in i asked of course we can't trade him in
he is our brother
they said
now luis he's is is six months old he can't do much
he's not much of fun my cat a had kittens the kittens
can run they're they a
they are only three months old they are younger than luis
all luis does
is sleep wells
sleep well sometimes he cries he eats a lot too
how long does it take
a baby to grow i asked the kittens are younger than luis they can do many things luis has a problem he can't do anything
look at our kittens mom said they're almost as big as their mother but people
take longer to grow than kittens do soon luis will be able to
would do things
soon he will be more fun
mom took
some pictures of a
pictures from a box they were pictures from my baby pictures
mom said once you were as small as luis
luis
luis he
s
see how much
much you
have grown in six years
then luis started to cry
lunch time said mommy
you and luis need lots of good
good
food to
do all
that growing
that gave me an idea
maybe luis wasn't growing fast bec
cause he
didn't eat the right food kittens
kittens eat
kittens f kitten food
they grow very fast maybe if
if mom
maybe if mom m
fed luis kitten food he'd
grow as f
gr he'd grow fast too mom didn't like that idea
kitten food is for kittens she told
me and you you and luis need people food to grow
you need food from each of the four food groups what are the four food groups mom i asked one group is dairy foods like milk and f
ish
eggs and nuts are the meat
wait
one group is dairy foods like milk and cheese
a second group is meats like chicken and fish eggs and nuts
are in meat
the meat group
too a third group is br
eads and cereals and the fourth group is fruits and vegetables
i thought about the problem with luis maybe he did not eat enough
enough he could
he could never grow
grow just eating
baby food luis should eat the sames food that i eat maybe
he he would grow faster i said he can't eat the food that you eat mom said he's only
has two teeth
he can't chew well i didn't think of that luis
only had two teeth i can't be
fun
being a baby even for
luis i eat
s
the things that
that make me grow i like foods
i eat
uhm
i think that well it's
luis' big brother isn't happy with luis because
he isn't growing fast enough and he just doesn't like it when well
when he
he doesn't like how luis gets more attention then
then him

them away bigger clouds came the then came dark
fat clouds they filled the sky

a rain drop fell on tim's head
tim looked up again another drop hit his nose tim smiled he knew that the dark clouds would go away

that's all i can guess
it had not rained for in many weeks all the streams
and all ponds were dried up
an old crow had
been looking for water all morning at
last at last he found some in a picture in a garden he flew down to it and stuck his and stuck in his bill
but he could not
reach the water
oh
he walked over to the other side and tried again
he
he still could not reach
he walked
at the cool water
oh how thirsty he was he felt
fa he felt faint
i must
i must
s have
that water i'm going
to get it he
he said
he stretched stretched his neck into the pitcher until he was sore but
could
but could reach
the water he stopped for a second
and thought
then he said my beak is strong
and
hard i'll break the pitcher so he gave
the pitcher a hard thump it didn't did not break he picked
he
pe
at the fir at it first here and then there
it did not ever crack
what a strong pitcher it was
this simply won't do he said
i have to try some other plan i am big and strong i will help the p
i
will tip the pitcher over
he pushed against
the
pitcher with his chest it did not
mo
ve nearby in the
garden lay some pebbles z the crow picked
one up and let
it fall into the pitcher
he dropped another then another he could see the water rise a
little now he worked harder than ever
soon the water
was high
enough that he could
reach it
na
that he could reach it how wonderful it ta
and did not give up he won
and that's the end
mmm
he was thirsty so he drunk the water and it was too low so he used the rocks to hold it up

tim liked to go outside on sunny days he liked to feel the cool breeze he liked to hear the wind he liked to see the white puffy clouds today
clouds were racing across the sky
clouds never stay in one place
tim wondered where the clouds would go
white puffy clouds come
come on shiny days
tim said
what else do i know about clouds
i click on this little guy
tim thought about last monday
monday was a foggy day
what is fog tim asked his mom
fog is a layer of clouds near
the ground mom said where does fog go tim asked
fog is fog is made
of tiny drops of water said mom the sun w will heat
the air the fog will dry up
tim thought about the fog he looked up at the sky today the clouds did not look like fog
like fog cloud
tim remembered the last
remembered a day last summer he
the clouds were white and fluffy
tim and aunt joan joan
or john
joan
watched the sun set the sky was beautiful tim saw a yellow
and orange and red
it might rain tomorrow
aunt
joan said
why do you think so t tim asked
the western sky has lots of clouds said
aunt joan
the wind is blowing from the west it
it could blow the white puffy clouds away it could blow the rain clouds here
rain may fall
tim remembered what aunt joan said
i know where the clouds go tim said the wind blows them across the sky
then new clouds come and the weather changes he looked up
he looked up the small puffy clouds were gone
the wind had blown them away
bigger clouds came
then came dark fat clouds they filled the sky
plop
a rain drop fell on tim's head
tim looked up another drop
hit his nose tim smiled
he
knew that the dark clouds would go away
her plant is sick and uhm everybody tells her that uhm she has she has to do something to make it better
like water it or give it new soil or bud it
back or
or she needs new soil
or something
and she uhm
and she is doing all all of that and uhm her plant is growing a little bit better than it used to
uhm tim is wondering where the clouds go and uhm
and his aunt joan tells him that the wind blows clouds in every direction so they go different places
and uhm
tim w tim is curious what fog is because there are all these clouds in the way
like
sixteen million thousand drops in the skies
that could make a lot of clouds
you can come hunt with me today said father fox to his son you are ready to find your own food

that's the end see i think
the leaves and the roots
we make cool shade on the green grass said the flapping leaves we dress
the tree in fresh and
qui
quite green
it is bare and brown without us
tired people and hot animals are happy for our shade children love to play under us
is it
at night the song
n birds of the woods fly to us
for our safety
we hide the nest of mother birds
the light wind say stay with us and play with us and the leaves felt very proud
and import
what you say is all very true but you should not forget us said a voice from the earth we are surely worth something
and who are you
where
we where do you grow asked the leaves we are deep in the ground far below
you but we feed the stems
and make
you grow we are the roots
you owe your beauty to us we are not pretty like you are but we
do not die
winter does not change us but when it comes y you
you fall
the tree stands firm
we hold in th
it in place if we died the tree would die and you
would die with it
the end

and let it fall into the pitcher
he dropped in another then another he could see the water rise a little now he worked harder than ever

that he could reach it how wonderful it tasted he drank as much as he wanted and flew away because he used his head and did not give up he won

well chris gram said today we can do anything you want
can we read the book your
great grandmother wrote i asked yes said gram
i'll go and get it
the book was very old the pages were yellow
the book smiled old
smelled old
this is my great grandma's diary said gram
she was your great great great grandma
she wrote about how our family came west then she was a little girl
didn't yo our family always live here i asked
no chris they came to california from new york in these in those days there were no cars or
or planes
there were few trains people traveled in wagons pulled by horses
that sounds like fun i said it was not fun for my great grandma her family had to cross rivers and plains mountains and deserts the united states is a big country they went from one side to the other
gram opened the book
to the middle this tells what i was like on plains on on the plains i'll read it i'll read it
we are
we are crossing the great plains everything is so flat i can see
miles and miles of grassy land i see mountains but they're
but they are still ahead so far away
i think we'll never reach them
i had to walk beside the
beside the wagon all day because the horses were tired
now i am v very tired and my legs hurt
what is a what is a plain i asked gram
i asked gram
it's a flat land it has grass but few trees she said when great grandma crossed the plains few people lived there water was hard to find today farmers grow food there
did they ever get to the mountains i asked
gram turned more pages here it is september sixth eighteen sixty we were in rocky mountains there they are so high they
the weather is very cold and it's not even winter
far below i can see rivers we will cross them soon
from there they look like s little silver threads
did they cross the rivers i asked
let's see said gram she turned more pages
here's something about a river
september thirty eighteen sixty
two days ago we came to a fast river
it was the colorado river i am tired of crossing rivers papa said that we will reach the
desert soon then i will wish for a river
then i will wish for a river
i don't want to cross the desert
what's the desert i asked
a desert is a very dry wait a desert is very dry
there is very little water
people can die without water
gram told me
if i crossed the a desert i'd run fast i said it's not that easy gram said
let me find a page about the desert here it is she said here it is she said october fifteen eighteen sixty
there is nothing here but sand it is very hard to walk in
the water is bad to drink
we could not find
the last water hole some animals have died people are weak and sick are and sick
we are hot and thirsty
in a day
in the daytime we are cold and hungry at night
that was the hardest part of the trip
she turned more pages this is the best part of the
diary sh she said
november two eighteen sixty
papa got us to a river now we have all the water we need we climbed a hill from the tops
we saw green hills and valleys
papa says our new home will be there also also
i i also saw water far away it is beautiful i know we will be happy there i it was a long trip i said yes said gram sometimes they were
hungry sometimes they were afraid but they never gave up i looked out the window i thought about the
about how i love california
i'm glad you
your great grandma came here i'm glad your your my gram grandma too i said
gram gave me a hug so i am she said so i am she said
oh so am i
well what happens in the story well it's about
this grandma telling her grandchild that about a special story when she was a kid i think and they were crossing the desert
and going across the united states like that
and so
it took them a long time and they didn't have water for very long but finally they got here and had all the water they needed to california
because they got to california and so now they're living in california and
and so far that
they're what they're doing is reading their great great great great great grandma's diary
and
so what they're doing is they're tell they're reading the story about he their they're great great great great grandma

lois and sam were
reporters for the kids science newsletter they studied their new assignment
it's tough it's a tough one sam said
louis
we have to write
an article about sight
eyesight
sam asked
one of our our senses sh that shouldn't be too hard
that's not the problem
louis replied
the problem is when are we our going to have
time
to do it
it's due on monday today is friday
right tomorrow is our field trip to the zoo with ms gordon
added sam
maybe we won't be able to go to the
maybe we won't be able go to the zoo tomorrow louis said sadly
on their way out of school louis and sam met ms gordon
why are you
why do you have such gloomy faces she asked aren't you excited about
our field trip tomorrow
that's the problem
sam told her
we really want to go but we have work to do
we really have to write an
article about eyesight
so we won't have
time to go to the zoo
added louis
ms gordon smiled
that oh that's the that's no problem you can visit
the zoo and learn about eyesight too
she said we'll meet at the zoo at ten o'clock don't be late
sam and louis looked puzzled how could they do research about eyesight at the school
they both agreed
it was a w it was worth a try on saturday morning louis sam
and ten other students met ms gordon at the zoo gates
hi ms gordon called everyone is here so let's go
but ms gordon
but ms gordon
louis said we're still not sure how we can find facts about eyesight here
i'm sure we
you two will think of something ms gordon smiled
here's a s here's the snake house
sam and sh
louis
followed the group into the snake house
they stopped in front the windows
louis looked through the windows
what snakes do you see she asked
i don't see much answered s
sam
they're turning away when louis said
wait i saw something moving out of the corner of my eye right here near that big a rock
i s a long black black snake
it's a black mamba
s
sam said reading the sign below the window
he looked at louis
she seemed to be thinking
sam
and
d i saw that sam
i saw that snake at
out of the corner of my eye she said slowly that's called
pur
pil
hmm
per
e
pill
oh i just forgot what it's called
peripheral vision sam f finished
being able to see things
at our sides right continued louis per
peripheral
vision
is
a fact we can put on our article
yes said sam
and we can see things that move
that
s a second
louis was about w louis was about to agree but instead she pointed to
a another cage look sam it's a big fat snake
right here she said
lying in the grass it's hard to see because it's green like the grass
but
the snake is dark and the
grass is light green
oh i see it now
hey those are two more facts about eyesight
we can
see things that are dark and light we c and we can see color sam said sam
louis pointed to another cage i recognize this snake
she said it's a king cobra
and look said sam
on the
way down at the other end of the snake house it's a giant boa
boa constrictor
i really want to get
a close look at that snake wait said louis
there is
another eyesight fact that
we can see things that are near and far
now we have lots of facts about eyesight
let's go and see the boa constrictor it's my favorite snake
at the end of the day louis and sam thanked ms gordon you were right ms gordon
said sam we did our work and we had fun at the zoo
and you learned a lot
about one of your senses ms gordon replied your eyes are very important they take in light
and send messages about
the light to your brain
messages
about color movement and distance
louis asked
yes said ms gordon
and whether is something
b
is beside u
beside us
that's when we use our peripheral
vision added sam
yes that too smiled ms gordon
can you name the other senses
the the other four senses
louis
began
smelling and feeling
smelling and feeling
finished sam
and as they walked away
from the zoo gates
louis said i had fun
did you sam
you bet sam answered
i can't wait until our next assignment
well uhm sam and louis were uhm in the kids science thing for their school and they were
<br>
on an assignment about eyesight and they learned a lot of things about eyesight
they went to the snakehouse to uhm learn about eyesight
sil
uhm that you can see things out of the corner of your eyes and uhm you can see things that are the same color except darker or lighter
<br>
than their background
<br>
sil
a
sil
and they learned things about peripheral
<br>
vision which and when they were happy about everything that they learned they uhm were excited about their next assignment
mary was proud
of the
plan
plan she had
drawn
she h had
even
signed
her
name
at the
bottom
she but she still needed
some
add
is
advice
advice
advice
from her cousin
francis
francis was
a
was an
a
engineer
she'd
know the best place to build the
clubhouse
francis was
s
staying at
the
re
reuse use
you ruiz
ranch
while she stayed
of course
er
a
e
s course
earthquake
s
she said she whoops she was also studying
how to build
buildings that
would not fall down in
an earthquake
don't you like it
mary asked
as francis spread
spread out
the plan
on the kitchen table it
is the
plan okay
where should my friends
and i build
our clubhouse
one question at a time
francis laughed
you have
a you have a good plan
but the
walls should be
made of wood not
not bricks
but dad and i dug
up
the bricks from the
old patio
they're still good
mary explained
it's
great to
reuse
mattress
and bricks is
no
materials
materials
francis said
but bricks can fall
on you during
an earthquake
we haven't had any earthquakes here
for a long time
said mrs mister
ruiz
said
as he came into the kitchen
so why worry
w you don't have to worry
but
i believe people
should be
pre
protected said
francis said
earthquakes
have done a lot
of danger i
is some parts
of
california
will
there
ever be an earthquake near our
ranch
mark asked
we don't know for sure
francis said

seismic activity
mark asked
during most earthquakes rock
rock
dep dip inside the earth
move the breaks apart
broke rock
sure asked
sure shacks
in
send out
a for some
a
a vibration
of vibrations that
move the earth these vibrations are called
seismic waves
it's like dropping
a stone on a pole
a pool of water mary a nodded
she sh that the stone splashes
and waves
go out
of the
circle s

circle
circle
s cylinder
don't for
a said
shakes
it for
it can most
it to

she said
right francis said
something
the earth
rolls up
and down
if
an earthquake is strong
enough it can crush buildings
it can crush buildings to fall apart
cause buildings to
fall apart
but
you can make
some buildings
almost earthquakes
prove
earthquake almost earthquake proof
how
how mark asked
first you need
to find a place
to build
to build
on that's solid
like that
are ya are area
by the
barn
bran
barn
there's probably
great
deep
under
dirt
under the dirt
that
there
grit
granite is a very
hard rock
it usually
stays
firm
in
an earthquake
francis picked up
pieces
of corks corks
c
or
no
q q
q
quid
core quick
hole
o
quickly
maybe a
stick
when you build
you should use wood and
put
a
brick
here and
no here and here
thanks
hey
i have an idea
mr
r ri ra
ruiz
ruiz looked over
over francis' shoulder
you can
build the clubhouse
on the
square of the
corner near the barn
we used
to you we used
we used
to have a
shed there
we
when the wood rotted
it tore it
i tore it down
that's great francis said
building no the building
can be
br
the
braced on the
concrete
thanks dad
and thanks for your
help
francis and mary said
i'm going to find my
friends
then and and
tell them
we'll start building tomorrow
one of mary's friends
brought
sturdy
wood
uh for
the
sides
of the
building
another brought a
piece of
canvas
canvas for the roof
by the end of the
week
the clubhouse
was nearly finished
good choice for the
roof francis said one afternoon
as she checked on
the
pro projects
kevin canvas
canvas canvas canvas canvas
is lightweight
so i'd don't
hurt
anyone if there's
an earthquake
the last job was to make
a sign
mary had just finished
when
calico

carlo
calico
scampered
up
on

disappeared over the other side
mary shook her head
carlo had never acted this like this
then maria mary
felt the ground shake
she
looked

nothing could fall
on you
oh it was only a little rock

ruiz
tried to smile
did you know
this earthquake was coming
no this said francis
however
however
however
there were
a few signs
like more
missing activities
seismic activity
carlos too
mary remembered
remembered
francis nodded
all animals may feel
movement deep
in
the earth before
we can feel it
but we can't
depend on them
we have to learn
what to do when a earthquake strikes
right
mary said with a smile
like building an earthquake proof
clubhouse
trying to build a treehouse but then all of a sudden a little earthquake struck and they were kind of surprised and then they tried to find a silly way to joke about it
uhm they built it o on concrete uhm they built it with a strong roof
<br>
uhm
<br>
they built it with wood instead of bricks
sil
uhm
sil
uh let's see what else and then they just built it were an old house was
am i just supposed to read into this microphone
okay
okay
that monday ruth leaned back in the warm grass
she could see a cloud dragon suddenly a door slammed
doc is home ruth said jumping to her feet
doctor bell lived next door
doc liked to ride in balloons
doc took her big balloon to the park
her friends
always helped to fill the balloon with air
then
to h to heat the air so the balloon would rise
doc would climb into a large basket tied to the balloon
then the balloon would lift doc high toward the clouds
ruth found doc by her garage
sh she was looking at her big thermometer
ruth knew what
the therm the therm the thermometer
measures the temperature of the air
as
as the air warms the red liquid in the
in the glass tube rises
as the air cools the red liquid in the tube falls
balloons are h
hard to fly said doc
you need the right kind of weather
she looked at the sky let's see what the clouds tell us about the weather ruth laughed how can the clouds
tell
us anything
doc pointed to the fluffy white clouds
in the sky
those are cum
cumulus clouds
they tell us that fair weather is here
fair weather is balloon weather said doc
ruth smiled ruth smiled
they look like balls of cotton
doc showed ruth pictures of the kinds of clouds
cirrus clouds
high in the sky are thin white and curly
they tell me that the weather might change in about a day
so cumulus clouds
mean it's nice out and cirrus clouds mean
change said ruth
third kind of cloud to look for is stratus said doc
it is
it is a thick low cloud
it covers the sky
fog is stratus cloud near the ground
what are clouds made of asked ruth
clouds are made of tiny drops of water
or bits of ice doc sky ex explained
i have an idea she said suddenly
you watch the clouds this week weather weather is just
when the weather
ok where am i
ok
when the weather is right we'll go for a balloon ride
ruth
ruth asked her parents if she could go
and they said yes she could she couldn't wait
the next morning ruth saw fog the sky was filled with thick low clouds
stratus clouds she said no balloon ride today
on wednesday the sun was shining
ruth dressed in a rush
and
ran
to find doc she opened the back door she saw
she saw mr
hill's
flag flapping in the wind
she thought about being blown across sky
in the big balloon
i can see why
balloonists
don't go up in the wind she thought it wasn't balloon weather after all
early thursday morning ruth called doc
there's no rain no or there's no rain
there's no rain or wind
the weather is just right
there are only a few cumulus clouds in the sky you're right said ruth said doc
you're right ruth said doc
let's go
at the park ruth watched the big orange balloon fill with air
it got bigger and bigger
the balloon looked like a big pumpkin t to ruth
it's a c it's a pumpkin balloon she shouted
doc helped her climb into the basket doc's friends
united
united united
untied the rope slowly the balloon rose
over
floated over
the pumpkin balloon floated over the land
it floated above ruth's school
it floated above mr hill's flag
it was so nice to be up high
but in less
than an hour the wind began to blow
we'd better land now said doc
ruth didn't mind
she had a
she'd had a great time
soon the big pumpkin balloon was very
soon the pumpkin balloon
was back on the ground
thank you very much
doc said ruth
sure doc
replied i like having company would you like to go up again
oh yes said ruth
what a good day it had been
now ruth would watch the sky every day
she could hardly wait for a clear blue sky or some cumulus cumulus clouds without any wind
then it'd be time for another ride in the pumpkin balloon
ruth uhm
sil
and
sil
ruth uhm always went to the park and asked and watched doc doc go up in the uhm ballon into the sky
<br>
and one day she asked her mom if she could go and her mom said yes and then one day it was cloudy
sil
so she couldn't go and then on wednesday she could go because uhm
sil
it was sunny so she went to the park and met doc and they blew up the balloon and untied the rope and she went up and then they it started getting windy so they had to land
sil
and she wanted to go again and then
sil
well she said she didn't mind but she asked if she could go again

and
frogs and insects that lived near the creek

both jumped back
when the
log splashed
and dragged
itself
up the bank wow

resting resting on the bank
of their creek

dr thomas is

s
soon mister thomas to thomas arrived in a truck that had
wildlife
resort painter on it
the trucks pulled a
trailer trailer with a boat
bryan and judy ann looked up at
dr thomas
he was very tall
he smelled
curly curly brown
and gray beard
come see the alligator judy ann
cried
its in dead
its answered
in that
our neighborhood
said bryan
dr thomas laughed
alligators live here long before people did
you might
be saying
we're
inventing its
its neighborhood
invaded its neighborhood
dr thomas explained
that he was going to catch the alligator and take
it back
take it
to a place
far away from
where people lived
he took a long
bowl
out of his
out of his
truck
the bowl
has loop loops
on each end
loops on each end
i use this to catch
the alligator he said
the handle
is
square
to keep
the bowl from
twisting
while
i use it
why is
one loop bigger than the other asked judy ann
because alligators come in different sizes answered mister dr thomas
oh my goodness
alligators can
run for
only a short distance but they can run fast so why don't you stand
this story was about two kids and they found an alligator and the alligator wasn't supposed to be there and so uhm
<br>
they called the fire department and uhm
<br>
he took uhm a stick with two loops on the end and he took the biggest loop and slided it over the uhm alligators neck and then he took a big black rubber band and put it around the alligators nose

how studies fossils they work
to understand the
what life on earth was like a million years ago
a million years ago
oh it's time for recess
ok maybe the fossil is a bone from a real dinosaur

the fossil
she looked sh surprised and ex excited where did you find this a she asked scott answered my dog taffy dug
it up near
the new road
n told the children that a fossil was a dinosaur toe bone
toe bone it doesn't look like a toe bone
uhm

do you like bunnies
hi my name is cory i like rabbits and cats and dogs i like to go on walks in the morning if it's not too chilly i like the snow and going to sledding i really don't like skiing i'm going to a birthday party on saturday i my best friends name is hailey i have two friends names hailey i have a girl in my class who's very nice to me her name is caitlin i like to write and read and do math my favorite subject is writing it
pick the cat up but sometimes we don't always think
dear mom and dad parents since you have grounded me and told t me to write down why i am sorry before i was allowed out of my room i am mad at you i would l
like
to start by saying that i think that you are very mean to make me do this because it wasn't even my fault
i couldn't help it anyway it was an accident and i didn't even do it in
it on purpose
i really didn't mean to shave the cat really i swear
ok here's what happened as i remember it
i saw that the cat was
proud of me
but for
for thinking so fast on my toes
oh sure it's easy to say that i should have just picked the cat up but sometimes we don't always think
all that great under pressure
you and you know what the stupid gerbils didn't even
thank me they just ran on that stupid wheel and did stupid things that's the last time i shave the cat to protect any stupid gerbils
besides the real reason i shaved the cat was to keep it nice and cool
i just didn't want to see the cat getting all hot and uncomfortable and stuff
you guys will just probably say it's winter danny
danny
cats don't overheat in winter
winter
but so what if
it's winter
winter i
mean
it'll
be sum soon summer soon enough and
al i just wanted the cat to get used to the idea before
it got really hot
plus oscar my turtle told me to shave the cat
fine oscar can't really talk but if he could he would s have said
said please shave the cat
cat
it t
keeps hitting me on the shell and trying to roll me over
when you leave the room you guys never
liked oscar as much as the cat
anyway
you wouldn't always take the cat's side if you knew the stuff he did to my poor turtle cat's aren't always nice just like my sister jenny isn't always nice
i
i knew our cat would grow her fur back but some cats don't have hair
they are called hairless cats and they need fur in the winter sometimes i think i swear that's the reason also i was going to sell the cat f fur and buy my sister jenny braces for her big stupid face
plus
i forgot to tell you that you should be blaming mrs cas mrs
cas
per
my science teacher she made us have
should i stop
she made us shave something for science ask her
she said what that when we should shave hair it grows back harder and sometimes even darker so i thought that if i could shave the cat a lot of a bunch of times her hair would grow back harder
back harder each time and soon
she would have an
in
in
v
s invincible coat
of cat fur armor then she would be a super cat and you
could take her
on t v shows and get lots of money so that you can send jenny to
college even if she is a dumb little tattle tale she's so good at school you
school and you brought her a cat cause she's responsible and stuff
just cause she's g good student
a good student
didn't mean she really responsible
she's really responsible
last night i saw that she didn't brush her teeth oh yeah i forgot to tell you that
dear mom and dad jenny didn't brush her teeth last night i think that she sh
should brush her teeth twice tonight
that's just my
opinion
opinion though i'll bet you didn't know something else
else did you know that i wanted to be a barber
i was afraid to tell you really
really re
the really reason i shaved the cat
cat was that i want to be a barber and i needed practice i was afraid you wouldn't let me practice on my own head can i practice by shaving jenny's head i promise that
i'll do a better job then i did on the
cat cause
now i have
what dad calls life experience not that i shaved the cat though
actually the truth is that
i
i be
accident turned on the nose hair clippers and the
cat was being chased by the turtle and ran right by the slip clippers and shaved her off self i kept saying no kitty no don't have shave yourself but my stupid sister never taught her
cat now how to listen so she just ignored me
ignored me see she's not
if i had a cat i would teach it to
not shave it itself
that's
for sure i don't have to get good grades to know that you should teach a cat to shave itself
plus
it w
plus if you weren't always
cuddling with my sister
so much maybe she would have been with her cat instead the cat came into my
my room because jenny never plays with it any
enough
the cat liked being shaved
anyway so i did don't see the big deal
i think it really liked its haircut the only reason it hasn't come
out for two weeks is because you guys made such a big deal about it poor kitty sh this
this and poor kitty that
it's your fault really dad please don't read the next part
dear mom
don't let dad know that
the real reason i shaved the cat was that he's always sneezing around it
i knew
how much
you hate
him
always sneezing and stuff so i thought if
i got rid of her fur she
fur he wouldn't sneeze and that
you would have a better marriage
so
it was really my father's day gift to him so i couldn't buy him anything nice since you took away my allowance for when i shaved the neighbor's dog
how come jenny's jenny gets a cat and i
get a stupid turtle anyway
anyway turtles don't do anything except poke their heads out and
be
not cuddly
heads out and be not cuddly can i get a dog please
s
so i
so in conclusion i'm getting hungry and i'm sorry for shaving the cat
although you can see that's
that it's really jenny's fault for not being as responsible as you're
al
you always say and not brushing her teeth p s if you would have brought her a turtle i couldn't have shaved it sincerely danny
that he's trying to blame it on somebody danny's trying to blame it on s the his uhm thing that he did on somebody else
sil
i think
sil
and
sil
he's saying that her sister he's saying that her sister his sister isn't uhm that responsible for the cat or brushing her teeth
sil
it was an accident

when his
owners found
him
as a
puppy
he was
very
dirty
dirty
so his
owners
named
him
fleabag
he soon
learned that
whenever his owner said
fleabag come he would
sometimes get a
yummy treat
that was a long time ago
when fleabag was happy
he was older
now and had
problems with his
back legs
that made
him
limp
limp when he ran
but that didn't
stop him from
running
like most dogs he
loved to run
there was a dog
park
near when he
lived
where he lived
he
enjoyed
playing with the
other dogs because
he didn't
have t have have to
be on his l
leash at the
dog park
there was
one dog named
that would always
come
up to
fleabag
and
bit
bite his back
leg and
run away
saying bark bark bark
bark
when
which in
dog tail
means
you
are too
slow
to catch me with your
limp
so
i'll go i'm going to
pick on
you
on you
fleabag
would always
chase
snot
but couldn't ever catch him
ha
one day fleabag
went
to the
vet
fleabag didn't
mind the vet because
actually
usually the
people in the
white
coats
gave him treats
fleabag was at the
vet to have
surgery on his legs
when he
awoke from the
surgery he didn't
remember where he was but
he sure
didn't did
want to see
his owners
soon
they came and
picked him up
and drove him home
fleabag
suddenly
realized that he his
legs
itched very
badly
he
thought
oh boy
i'm going
to
like my legs
so
hard
that
the itching is going to go away
so he
turned
his head around
to
to like
his leg
what
to lick
to lick his legs
but they there
was a big
white thing
in
the way
he saw
wearing
wearing a
collar
that made it
impossible
to lick his
legs
the next day he was
walking with his
owners
on his legs
and they went to
the dog park
his owners
wouldn't let
fleabag play
without his leash
signs
he still
needed to
heal but
it was
nice
to see all
his
friends
mean old snot
said bark bark bark bark
which
means in
dog
tail way
what
which means
in dog
tail
what
oh
which means
dog talk
why do you have
to wear
that
stupid
looking collar
boy do you look silly in that
ugly collar
ha ha ha
eventually
fleabag got
to
talk
to collar
of
off
got to take his
to take the collar off but
by when
the legs didn't
itch
so he didn't want to lick
want to
like
what
lick
them
for six weeks
he would take
walk
he would take walks
and go
to the
dog park but he
couldn't be
let off his
leash
which made him a little mad
at his
owners
one day he took a walk
to the dog park and all
his friends were
there
as usual
as usual
every
his owners
watched
around fleabag
and took
his leash off
fleabag
didn't know what to do
because he may h he had
been
on his
leash
so long
just one
snot
bit him
bit him on
the back
legs
and ran away
owners
said
release
which m
meant
he was
allowed
allowed
allowed to
run
so
fleabag
started running after snot
do i just do this
snot was
laughing because he
knew fleabag could never catch him
but
suddenly he
notice
noticed
that
him
that
fleabag was
catching up to
him and
before he knew it
fleabag
fleabag ran into
him and
knocked
him
down and said bark bark bark which in
dog
talk
means
don't you ever
mess with me again
snot
fleabag
was
able to run
faster
than
he could ever
remember
he
was
so happy that he could
run fast that
he s
sprinted
to his owners
and give him
give
them
big kiss

boat was a bot
botanist
botanist
of plants ex ex
expert
the
broken called him flower hunter
pete wanted to be
a flower hunter too
son i want you take your
carefully
at
every flower pete's father had said on
on an early trip
some plants don't have flowers pete
had an answer
you're right
his father had
had said
that
fir tree
doesn't have flowers
it's a conf
conifer
of
cone bearing plant it has hard brown cones
look pine cones said pete
yes do you want
yes do you want know what these cones
have inside them his father
asked his father pete opened the cone seeds
he said father do you
do all plants have seeds most plants do
they are divided into two
groups one flower
one
in flowering plants
in other is cone
bearing plants
flowering
plants have seeds
inside fruits
and
and cone bearing plants have seeds in
cones
on the last hun
on the last hunting trip
pete
had discovered
too
the two kinds of flowering plants one kind
have flowers with groups of three petals
dicots dicots have flower
flowers with groups
of
of four or five petals
it was fun looking at all those plants pete
heard
his father call i it was no time for grazing in campfires
into cr
gazing into campfires
peter come here please i think my leg is infected i have
a bad fever
his father said in a
tired voice you must help me son some plants can help me get well bring it me willow bark
of pine sap
for my leg
club moss too
if you can
please hurry pete
was afraid
he f
he could find right plants he would have to try
he hurried off into the woods
it was easy to find the willow bark
willows
with long skinny leaves were growing
by the river pete l
liked
their sharp smell he s
stripped off some bark
and put it
in his pouch
finding
finding pine sap was easy too
pine trees stood
all around him
he saw their prickly cones and smelled their green needles pete
picked
lumps of sap off the bark
tiny club moss
plants grew under the pines they looked like toy trees
he
pete remembered that club moss
is
a
it shook the plants over the small jar
soon the jar was
full of spores now pete started to hunt for
bonus plant he s
searched everywhere he it was getting
he was getting hungry
his feet hurt
and
and the searches
s
scratches
covered his arms finally he found a few
plants that looked right
but how could he be sure
he thought
back to his lessons about plants
pete's father had told him
that
botanist
botanist
carefully
checks the petals
fruit leaves stems
and roots to find each kind of plant
his father was always reminded that pete
they
there was a lot to
to know
about plants thinking again
of the lessons his father had given him
pete felt sad he would his father be all right
pete knew he must find the right plant his father
s life depended on
what he had learned he
e
he thought might be a
bone
set
it had
the right kind of small
white
flowers the leaves were
opposite
each other the stems too
each leaf had a partner right across from it
from one last test pete dug up
the plant and looked at the root
the root was fat and bumpy exactly right
as pete left
left the clearing he saw are
a bush with something white on it
he was he went closer
the bush had shiny green leaves some leaves
were turning red
it had large white flowers pete had never seen anything so pretty
father
will
like this he brought
he knew better than to touch a strange plant but he studied it closely then he then he turned to
then he turned to pete
he returned to camp
pete showed his father the plants
he had found
he told him about the strange plant with white flowers too he yes these are
the right plants son
his father smiled but where did you find the plant with the white flowers i'll show you when
you are feeling better said pete good said father pete
boiled some water in a cup he put the willow bark
to make tea
after letting
it sit for a while pete's father drank the tea pete
put
the pine sap
and
club moss spores
on his father's leg
then pete's father slept for hours when he woke
awoke
pete's father felt much better the willow bark
and bone
had made a
his fever go away
and the club moss spores and the pine sap were helping
his
infected l
leg heal
this is long
pete can you help
make a crutch asked
his father
then
i want you to make me
to see that plant well
the white
flowers
it's in this clearing by the river
pete
explained
they hiked to the clearing pete's father studied the plant you've made
an exciting discovery
he said
we'll take some cuttings from this plant
and you can name it i think you should name it
your friend ben
franklin
he likes science
he'll like
to have a plant named after him
that's a fine idea
his father added
looking at
him proudly pete and
and pete you're going to be a great flower hunter
uhm pete's father broke his leg and started to have a fever and pete had to go out to buy to get more uhm stuff to make him feel better
sil
so the he found the willow bark and the s sap and the bonused and he found a cool looking plant and he named it after his friend

the clock struck one the mouse ran down
hickory dickory dock
inside the hollow wall of the house
why up
way up
never
never the
roof
there lived a family of mice
it was a
it was a song
little home
it was nice and quiet and as dark as any
mouse could ever want
mamma mouse liked it

crack in the wall
hickory
stuck his head through

quiet the family of people
what lived in the house
that lived in the house was fast asleep so
so he went through the crack and
his
his two
brothers came after
they their
little
heads
be
beat very fast because they knew
if they were found they would have to be
they w
would have to run for their lives
they
crept over the
things
crept until they came to some
s
stairs
what
she will do now hickory asked his brothers
let's go down said dock
so they went down and
the stairs to the hall of the house
very carefully they were surprised by what they saw
there was a
big wall of that
and
coats
a
bucket
for
umbrellas two
very
pretty
chairs and
what's that word
tennis
best of all a tall clock
that should
on

they were telling about the story and they told the father died by a mouse trap
<br>
uhm and after that their mom went to go uhm get food and she found some crumbs and it was almost morning <br> and uhm

oh yes do said
well said hickory
i'd like to take a little stroll
myself but you
must promise to be very careful and not get into any trouble
i'll take you through the hole
hole that i found
so the three little mice started off with hickory
showing the way soon they came
to a crack in
the wall
hickory stuck his hand through
he
saw that all was quiet and
family
family of people that lived in the house was fast asleep
so
he went through the crack and
his two brothers came after
the little
hearts beat very fast because they knew if they were found they would have
they would have to run for their lives
they crept over the
thick carpet
un
until
they came
to a to some stairs
what
shall we do
now hickory asked his brothers let's go down said dock
so they went down the stairs to the hall of
the mouse
house very carefully
they were
surprised what they saw
there was a big wall
for k h
hats and coats
a
bucket for umbrellas two
very pretty chairs and
what's that say
best
of all
a tall
clock was stood on the
floor
and
they can't eat this stuff so
what is it asked dickory quietly
i don't know said hickory
he was afraid too
he was afraid too
too
is it said alive asked dock
i don't know said hickory the hickory again
went they saw that the clock
kept ticking away
is so they got their
courage up and ran about suddenly
dickory
gave a yell
and made his brothers
come running
there is a corner lay
all closed
half of in of when in it
the little
are
a around
of the family had
it was a great
find
for the three mice they
ate
until
the last crumb was gone and
and they were fat
and happy
this is better than the
kitchen said dock
they had finished their supper
and i bet there are plenty more good things around if we only look
for them
but
all the doors in the hall were closed dock went to the clock
he found nothing except
a hole to inside of the clock
and he stuck his hand in
dock
could hear
the ticking louder
than ever now
he looked
way up to the
top of the clock yeah
okay
oh ok
and saw something bright
he thought it must
be good to eat if he could only get
to it
without saying anything
to his brothers dock ran up to
sides
of the clock until he came to the
gears
he was
what do what do they mean he was
oh
it was one clock
it it was one clock
they
the clock was
just telling
the time but the big bell was just beside
dock's ear and the noise hurt the poor little mouse
the screamed
he screamed with fear and ran down the clock
as fast as he could
go
when
he got to the hall he heard his brothers running up the stairs
h
he ran after them as fast as he could
only when they were safe their ne
nest again did
mamma mouse came back in the morning
flour with her for
with her for breakfast
they told
her about their
adventure
she thought they had been
punished enough
already for not
listening to her so she did not
scold them
she only said you
see my dears you
dears your mother knew best when she told
you not to leave the nest
children
sometimes th think
they know more than their parents
this adventure should teach you always to listen to your mother
the next time you run away it may
end worse than
last night after all remember
what
happened to y your poor father
but hickory and dickory and dock did not run away again
their father got killed by a mouse trap
<br>
and uhm
<br>
i forget the other part
and their mother went out to get food and uhm hickory dickory and dock went on an adventure and uhm

justin was eight and a little too smart for his own good justin was his
justin and his mother went shopping for hats and found the perfect but justin would never
wear the hat and all his mom could do
was roll her eyes
it wasn't
that he didn't like the hat in fact he loved it
he
he thought it was great
it totally fit his head he loved the way
the
he loved the way it was
a little tight at first but the stretched at the perfect size he loved the color the size the shape even the hat smell
he even liked the way
his hair
looked when he took the hat off
he looked
he got
com
plaints the on the hat the first time he wore it at school and everyone thought he looked handsome in his hat
unfortunately
justin was too smart for his own
good he figured that
he the hat
get dirty or lost if he wore it too much so he made the promise to himself he would never wear the hat except on special days he wanted
the hat to be clean and perfect forever
if it gets dirty it wasn't
i'll
wash it silly said his mother
but it will
shrink if you wash it and then it will be too small he said
soon you're
a bit too
silver for you own
good said his dad
you should really wear the hat if you like it or else you'll be sorry
but justin didn't listen and everyday but
with the hat sat in a clear plastic box so that it wouldn't get dirty sometimes justin
would look at the hat display and imagine himself walking around the school and with the hat on his head once
he even imagined himself as a grown up wearing the hat and speaking in front of many people he imagined the people whispering to themselves what a fine speaker
he and is a such a handsome
and his ninth birthday he decided to wear the hat
wear
there were many presents but the only thing that made justin
excited was his hat
he opened the plastic box and grabbed
the hat out carefully he slowly slid out
on so he could hear the fabric against his hair
he got
it on the supposed to be before
hence
it was like remembering he was so happy could
help
so happy that he couldn't help
but smile
i know it's just a hat he thought to himself but i sure love it
but
then he noticed that it wasn't
stretching quite enough
some
something was wrong it was a little tight
not too tight in fact it still still looked great on justin and no one
even
know it wasn't perfect fit for looking but he knew
justin knew it was perfect anymore
he cried he couldn't help it
since he was so smart
he
knew crying wouldn't help make the hat perfect again
so but he cried any
he told his parents i don't want any wear those
i don't want
any of those gifts i want to return
them all and try to find a new perfect hat instead
his parents looked at each other and knew that justin had learned a good lesson son
we would
be happy to buy you a new hat we need to know something before father said
justin being pretty smart knew that his father needed to know
save your breath did i think
know what you're going to say
i promise of you find the perfect hat
that we'll wear it everyday
so justin and his mother went shopping for hats
and found the perfect one but from
then on justin would never take off
all his mom could ever say roll her eyes
it's about justin gets a hat and uhm
sil
first he loves it really but he doesn't want to wear it much at school and then
sil
one day its his birthday and it's his ninth birthday and when he puts it on it's too small and it's not perfect so he wants to return all the gifts and go get another one that's perfect

once a
once a long time ago there were no pink roses all the roses in the world were white there weren't any red ones any yellow ones or any pink ones there were only white roses
very early one morning a little wh white rosebud woke up
she saw the sun looking at her
he stared so hard that the little white rosebud didn't know what to do
so she looked up at him and said why are looking at me so hard
because you are so pretty said the big round sun
she turned pink after that all her children were little pink roses
sh is she asked victor black widow mr foster answered let's go boys said m mrs garcia i'm sure mr foster has many other interesting things to show us mr foster enjoyed taking summer visitors through the visitors center at the state park
as they walked through the center he told victor and tommy a story about a super spider that spun giant webs and tricked bigger animals
now now victor was more curious than ever about spiders
i've got just the book for you mr
y victor mr foster said
it is called spiders from a to z it is a good book to bring on a spider hunt mr foster smiled
hey would you like to go on a spider hunt tomorrow oh yes victor and tommy shouted
should i
like sly hunters they sneaked through the tall wet grass soon victor spotted a funnel shaped web in the grass in the center of the web sat a spider
you'd better watch out victor tommy warned it might be a black widow
mr foster smiled why don't you check in the book to see what kind of spider it is you don't want touch an animal or plant until you know it's harmless tommy and victor studied the spider book it's a funnel weaver victor said at last not a black widow
black widows don't make webs like this very good said mr foster funnel weavers are very are non poisonous the boys and mr foster watched the spider for several minutes then mr foster had to leave as soon as mr foster left victor had got an idea quick he said to tommy run back to the house
mom dad victor shouted when they arrived i found a spider in the grass my keep it
i wanna
watch and it to see how it lives
it's a hold on said dad wh where will you keep it in the old aquarium victor replied
ok victor said mr garcia a spider will be fun to watch but you must take care of it and feed it the boys went out with mr garcia to the barn and found the aquarium they covered the bottom with moss grass and stones they covered the top with a wire screen
then the boys returned to the orchard to capture the spider victor
vic victor carefully
care victor carried the spider to the house in a shoebox then he carefully tipped o the box over
and the spider fell softly onto the moss inside the aquarium you know what tommy victor said i think i'll call my spider clarence clarence the super spider saw
a week a week later victor saw clarence guarding a curious round object hidden
hiding hidden between some stones victor looked at it through his hand lens what is this he wondered
victor searched through his s spider book until he found a picture something
that looked like the object clarence was guarding
by comparing its shape and size to the picture victor discovered that it was an egg sac
the book explained that
the sac forms of
after a female spider mates
my spider must have mated with a male spider before i found her thought victor i'll have to show this to tommy and tell her my spider is not a clarence it's a clara
when victor returned with tommy he saw clara clinging to the egg sac the boys waited but clara didn't move
tommy looked closer oh no victor i think she's dead
the book said the spider would die after it laid its egg sac victor said sadly but i hoped it wouldn't happen to clara
i guess since since she's dead we should take the aquarium back to the barn
winter came and passed one spring day victor was searching for a watering can in the barn he glanced sadly at clara's cage that he and tommy had left there
last fall clara's web was covered with
hundreds of teeny tiny white beads
and the beads were moving victor ran to the house grabbed his hand lens and returned to the barn when he looked through the hand lens he saw that the beads were shaped like spiders
the baby spiders have hatched from the egg sac victor said i'd better tell tommy
a week passed victor
learned from the spider book that the spiders had grown big enough to take care of themselves
he also knew what he had to do he picked up the aquarium carried it outside he removed the screen from the top of the aquarium so spiders could leave goodbye little spiders he said it's time for you start a new life somewhere else
when victor came home from school
the next day he ran straight to the barn
the little spiders had gone victor sadly watched
walked back to the house victor you did the right thing mrs garcia said you made a proper home for clara and took very good care of her
and now you have given her ch children a chance to make homes of their own and have more spiders
victor smiled to smiled to himself he thought about last summer's spider hunt and about clara's egg sac he learned a lot about spiders since then
uhm
there was a
little
there was no pink roses and there was just white roses and uhm when it blushed it had little red roses cause it blushed
sil
uhm he had found this big spider er a spider in the grass and he asked his parents if he could bring it home and they let him but they said he had to take good care of it if he could have s if he wanted to have it
and uhm they had it had babies and uhm well th it had an egg sac full of babies
and the when the babies hatched they uhm came out and he
well they didn't come out uhm he put it out in the barn when it was snowing
and uhm
<br>
later that summer whatever uhm they hatched and he opened the cage so they could come out

dogs racer loved to run
there was a dog in the park near
where he lived
he didn't enjoy he didn't enjoy playing at the dog park because he didn't have to be on his leash when
a when he was three
so he could run as much as
he liked there was one dog at at
one dog at the park named fang
he would always come up to racer and bite his back legs and run away saying bark bark bark
which in in dog talk means you're
y you are too slow to catch me with
that limp of of yours i'm going to pick you're

the
itching is going to go away
so he turned to his head around the lick

his legs didn't itch

for six weeks racer would take walks
and go to the dog park but he still had to be on a leash

just then fang bit him
bit

and ran away racer's owners said go run so racer started running and chasing fang
fang was laughing because he knew
racer could never catch him but suddenly he noticed that racer was catching up to him racer was running faster than he could ever remember and before
he knew it he
he had caught up to fang and knocked him down
racer said bark bark which in dog talk means don't pick on me any more fang
and from that day fang never bit racer's leg
legs racer was too happy that he could run fast fast and
and
then he and ran
fast and that he and ran in circles finally he ran back to his owners

an ordinary
ex
explanation for everything
explaining for everything
w
christi noticed
a tall woman wearing
a raincoat
and carrying an umbrella
why would anyone carry an umbrella on such a beautiful day
on such a beautiful sunny day

laurel
laura spread
spread it the texas map out
on the dining room table
she looked at the green patch on the left
and read the words big
bend
natural
park
her mother looked over her shoulder
she pointed to the place
called
she said
what she she is
this is where we'll put our
rafts in the water she said
she moved her hands down the
rio
grande river
then she stopped
in
rock slide
what is rock slide axed asked laura
laurel
it's a surprise
of a trip
mom answered with a smile
we've
got to pack our clothes and pick up some fresh fruit for uncle don
uncle don was laura's favorite uncle
this year he promised to take them
on
one of
his river trips
in the
letter uncle don
said we must carefully
measure and weigh our
make weight
in his letter uncle to and said
we must carefully measure and weigh a
weight of everything we bring
we don't want the rafts to be too heavy
he wants us to fill our
big
cooler
with fruit and ice the we'll measure everything
and <unk> because
that's how we'll buy the fruit
he said the f
felt collar
color
can't weigh more than
seventy two pounds
our color weigh thirty pounds we can fill three two
layers plastic bottles and water and f freeze them
each one will weigh four pounds that means we can bring thirty pounds of fruit said laurel
<unk>
exactly said mom now let's estimate the weigh of some fruit and make a stopping list
shopping list on the way to the store laura wrote the list fourteen apples fourteen oranges twenty bananas two lemons two pineapples and two
bunches of grapes
at the store laura and her mom carefully weighed the fruit o on the list it weighed thirty four pounds that was a pretty good estimate mom said yes but
but i'd better take off some fruit the next day everyone met al
<unk> quickly they
inflated the rafts and put them in the water laura watched uncle don lower the raft with his supplies the raft sank lower in the water
as he paddled on the
cooking gear
gear
duffle bags in a big plastic jug
what is the jugs
in big plastic jugs what is the jugs asked laurel water
water uncle don answered in summer people need lots of water each day laura was surprised uncle dan had measured everything carefully before the trip she was glad that they had been so careful with the fruit
each person fills on a life jacket laura
missed was thirty one kilograms she could wear a
a junior sized jacket laura wrote on uncle dons raft she cl climbed on the top of the
tall bags
and watched uncle don pull his oar through the water then she looked to the river how deep was
rio grande she asked
let's find out by estimating said uncle don he pushed an oar to the water til it hit the bottom they then he pulled it out
compared to wet part of the oar
was that ice chest ice
the ice chest is about eighty centimeters long while
what bars is about twice as long that's only one of the half
matters uncle don looked worried the river is low it's going to be a rough trip through rock slide
what's rock slide l laura was puzzled
uncle don smiled just wait you'll find out soon
at night they came on the river bank under the stars and each morning the river looked even lower
eat up laughed uncle don
he
the more you eat the lighter the rafts will be once when we get to rock slide
laura wondered what rock slide could be
as they paddled small
rapids
rippled in the
distance
why do rafts look different then the rest of the river
asked laurel look at the water uncle don explained what is different about the water in the
rapids
laura stared at the
rapids it's
shallow she said i can see little rocks on the bottom right
now watch
that left float through the
rapids said uncle dan the water is faster too
uncle
laura added you're right again
we are going to ride
many
big rapids asked laura
no not until rock slide
uncle dan smiled
early that afternoon uncle dan decided to stop and camp
why are we stopping now laura asked listen whispered uncle
don above the splashing
laura could hear
a
front
roar
that's rock slide uncle don said
mysteriously
mysteriously
we'll need plenty of daylight when we reach it
we'll also have
to
repack said
ruiz
very carefully laurel listened to the roar she wondered how
a rock slide could make such a sound
it took a long time for her to fall asleep that night
the next morning
everyone got
on the rafts laura you ride on my
on your mother today said uncle don laura looked at the rafts
the food
chests of water
jugs were almost empty and
rafts seemed much higher in the water
uncle don is making his
raft
lighter she thought i bet
it's lower
at
rock slide
as they turned to the next bend
of the river laura saw other
rafts
p
resting on the bank
the
the r river was
disappeared into the mountain
of rocks
she had one sinking through rock slide
uncle don climbed
climbed to rocks over head
rock slide everyone followed
laura looked down at the canyon
there
the
lazy rio grande turned
into fast
fierce
raps uncle
rats
raps
rapids
uncle don took everyone
how to the trail
through the rapids
stay close to the sides of the cliffs he said laurel looked at the water
it was darker
near the cl
cliff sides it must be deeper here she thought
soon laura
huddled in the middle
was
speeding
raft
all around the water
poured was the
crashed over rocks
paddles pulling through the water
rapids
uncle all the canyon walls
water poured
too
in when laura's boat
leaned against the the rock
she
gasped
at the raft turning

at last the raft reached the canyon floor
i tired happily going

three seven two
three <unk> seven two three
<unk> two i think
before i tell you how rooster john got his name you should know a little bit about
the town of franksville
franksville was a town that seemed to have a problem after
the other
their problems started when they ran out of water
thankfully someone was digging a hole
and found water
but soon after that they started to get files
flies
they got tons and tons of flies
then
then they
then the flies stopped
but just then a man moved into town who played the flute so badly that people would run away screaming
maybe a poorly played flute doesn't sound that bad
but just try to imagine someone scratching and
at
scratching a chalkboard with a fork and then
multiply
multiply that that times a hundred
that's how the flute sounded when this guy played it
i'm i'm serious still i it's not as
bad as millions of flies i suppose
that the bad flute payer player was rooster john
he wasn't called rooster john yet
that came later
when
he knew he was the new town dentist
new was an excellent dentist but his real love was music
he played many musical instruments such as the guitar
the tuba and the piano and the clarinet
however for some
reason
he alway
the way his mouth was shaped
he
shaped
shaped made a funny made has flute sound fun awful
we can't let you play the flute anymore john
said the police much sheriff sanders
the neighbors are complaining
he and the cats and dogs are trying to chew off their ears
but i have to play i was born to do it
i don't know why
don't know why but i feel like i have
to or else bad things will happen
look john i've heard you play the clarinet
you're quite good
why don't you
play that instead said sheriff sanders
oh that's a nice instrument but it's not but it's just not the flute
i even wrote a s you a song
sheriff sanders
it's called cops and robbers
then he played the song the police chair sheriff
hated the sound so much that he threw john in jai
but they couldn't keep
john in jail since he wasn't really breaking any laws so there was nothing the police could do besides every
everybody loved john since the since he had become
the town dentist everybody's teeth were
much whiter and cleaner
and had no one
and no one had any cavities
so the
so there was a problem
in the little town of franksville
what should they do
they couldn't keep john in jail they
and
they didn't want to kick him out of
town because they all had such nice teeth
so they decided that john could play the flute and everybody else would have to wear earplugs
well i'm sure you you guessed
that
didn't that didn't work
no one could hear anything people were getting into car accidents and everybody looked really silly at dances
at dances dancing to the music they couldn't hear
just
they just couldn't
lead
a normal life
then they decided to
lower him down
a well and let him play down there where no one could hear him
john thought there that was
an ok an ok idea
but there was
an
echo in the well that made the flute sound louder
windows were breaking and all the cows in
in town started make to make milk sour
local
the local scientist dr wong
came up with an idea
he thought that if he made up a new mouthpiece especially shaped
for john's mouth
perhaps he could play the flute normally
and guess what
it worked dr dr wong
was the town hero
the flute sounded normal
and it turned turned out john could play
it quite well
the people in the town decided
t
to have
a great big parade
in franksville to celebrate the fact for once there was no problem
no fly
no fly problem and no and the flute problem
and no flute problem
dr wong
and
john were
the stars of the parade they were up on the main float
but
in a
a big band played as they marched up
as they marched
up and down the main street everyone cheered
some then suddenly a fly landed on
a little girl then a fly
then a fly landed on someone else
then some landed on a bunch of people
pretty soon tons of flies were landing on everybody
before they knew it the town was filled with flies again
oh no chief
s sanders said just when a little was going good for franksville
john didn't know what to do
so he
just kept on playing his flute
the flies were annoying so he had to swat them as he
with his hand or even his new flute
he started shaking the flute to get the flies off and accidentally smashed it into pieces he was very upset at first
then he said oh well
good thing i brought my old flute as a back as back up
no no please
don't play your old flute
begged dr wong
i but it was too late john had started playing
when the towns
when the townsfolk heard the
the noise they couldn't even swat flies anymore
they had to cover their ears from the horrible sound
the flies would land all over people and they couldn't swat it off
they couldn't swat them off
it was
gross suddenly the flies flew away
as fast as they could dr wong
thought for a second
then uhm pronounced
his
it's the flute sounds that
the flies hate john's flute playing as much as we do
john the dentist is driving the flies away
it was that it was then that
the people of franksville realized that they would
have
that they would have to take
the good with the bad
because as bad as the flute sounded it was a lot better than
thousands of crawling flies on them
from then on john would wake up
and <unk> strings strings of
s
up at
<unk> like a rooster
to play
the flute
to
to keep
the flies away
and since they were down on water they couldn't have the flies to eat to drink all of it so they had to keep some way away from the flies and so
that's and uhm they could keep them away with the flute
uhm he was actually kind of the hero for it and uhm
sil
he just gets to uhm
he just helps them actually with
sil
he helps them with both things getting white teeth and
uhm keeping the flies away

super spider
wow that one is really weird victor garcia said to his mother and his friend tommy
it sure is said tommy
it looks like a space creature
that spider is no space creature but she is dangerous said mr foster the park ranger
what kind of s
spider is she asked victor
black widow
mr foster
asked answered
let's go boys said mrs garcia
i'm sure mr foster has many other interesting things to show us
mr foster enjoyed taking center v
visitors through the visitors center at the state park
as they walked through the center he told victor and tommy a story about a super spider that spun giant webs and tricked bigger animals
now victor was more curious than
than ever about spiders
i've got just the book for you said victor
uhm
mr foster said
it is called spiders from a to z
it is a good book to bring on a spider hunt
mr foster smiled
hey would you like to go on the spider hunt tomorrow oh yes
victor and tommy shouted
like sly hunters they sneaked through the tall wet grass soon victor spotted a funnel shaped web in the grass
in the center of the web sat a spider
you'd better watch out victor tommy warned it might be a black widow mr foster smiled why don't you check in the book to see what kind of spider it is you don't want to touch an animal or plant until you know it's harmless
tommy and victor studied the spider
book
it's a funnel weaver victor said at last not a black widow black widows don't make webs like this very good said mr foster
funnel weavers are non poisonous
the boys and mr foster watched the spider for several minutes then mr foster had to leave
as soon as mr foster left
victor got an idea quick he said to tommy run back to the house
mom dad victor shouted when they arrived i found a spider in the grass may i keep it
i want to
to watch
it to see how it lives it's a hold on said dad
where will you keep it in my old aquarium
vic
victor replied ok victor said mr garcia mr garcia
a spider will be fun to watch but you must take care of it and feed it
the boys went with mr garcia
to the barn and found the aquarium
they covered the bottom with moss grass and stones they covered the top with a wire screen
then the boys returned to the orchard to capture the spider
victor carried
ok
the spider to the house in a shoebox then he carefully tipped the box over and the spider fell softly onto the moss inside the aquarium
you know what tommy victor said
i think i'll call my spider clarence clarence the super spider
a week later victor saw clarence guarding
a hold c curious round object
hidden between some story stones
victor looked at it through his hand
hand lens
what is this he wondered victor searched
through his spider book until he found a picture of something that looked like the object clarence was guarding
by comparing its shape and size to the picture
victor discovered that it was an egg sac
the
female book explains that
the sac
forms after female
spider mates
the my spider must have mated with a male
spider before i found her said victor
i have to show my to tommy
it
and tell him my spider is not a clarence it's a clara
that's my name
when victor returned to t
tommy he saw clara clinging to the egg sac
the boys waited but clara didn't move
tommy looked closer oh no victor i think she's dead
the book said the s that the spider would die after it laid its egg sac
victor said sadly
but i hope it won't happen to clara
i guess since she's dead we would take the aquarium back to the barn
winter came and passed one spring day victor was searching for a watering can in the barn he glanced sadly at clara's cage
that he and tommy had left there for
last fall
clara's web was covered with hundreds
of tiny white beads and the beads were moving
victor ran to the house grabbed his hand lens and returned to the barn
when he looked through his
hands lens he saw that the beads were shaped like spiders
the baby spiders hatched have hatched from the egg sac victor said i'd better tell tommy
a week passed victor learned from the spider book that the s spiders had grown big enough to take care of themselves
he also knew what he had to do
he pick up the aquarium
and carried it outside he removed the screen from the top of the aquarium so the spiders could leave goodbye little spiders he said it's time for you to start a l a new life somewhere else
when victor came home from school the next day he ran straight to the barn
the little spiders had gone victor sadly walked back to the house
victor
you did the right thing mrs garcia said
you made a proper home for clara and took very good care of her
and now you have given h
her children a chance to make homes of their own and have more spiders
victor smiled to himself
he thought about last summer's spider hunt and about clara's egg sac
he had learned a lot about spiders since then

and what happened is he as is he asked the the manager how much it weighed so
sil
he went home went to his aunt's so he went to his aunt's got a bunch of marbles put them into a jar a weighed those and see how much marbles it would take to weigh five pounds
sil
and then he and then counted the marbles and then the next morning he told he told the manager
sil
mister m
sil
m mister muggin or something well what he did is he is he got the marbles and he gave it to mister gray
sil
was about a little field mouse that was uhm after an acorn but he got trapped and then he was smart and got out
sil
and after that he gave uhm he put the acorn down too hard and and nicholas came out and gave it to his sister and uhm there was a little red man trying trying to keep him trapped also and

each s sign he put one word
when he was done

his s
signs and
birds mammals fish
uhm
and
and <unk>
amphibians and reptiles

feathers wings and beaks
they also lay eggs said sue
my
per

that's good thinking said grandpa
what about mammals billy asked
the cat is a mammal
grandpa said
so mammals
have
hair and fur said sue
and they don't lay eggs the babies grow
and the mother's body said billy
that's what happens when your cat

that kind of animal is
an
an
p
pe
t
amphibian
grandpa said
the babies hatch from eggs in the water
like fish do

grandpa shook his head
a whale is a strong
animal
it lives in the water like
fish but is really and mammal
sue nodded
i
saw a
movie about whales
baby whales come from their mother's body
not from eggs
and and
and mother whales nurse their babies in water
they also breathe
ot
with lungs

billy

do i press that before
clint took out his special box
he kept his favorite things
in the box
there was
the
arrowhead he found in
a field
there was a beautiful
golden shell
and a key
chain from the zoo
but the best thing h and
but the best thing
in
box was the blue ribbon
his father had
won at the
county fair when he was a boy
clint wished he
could win a blue ribbon just like his dad did
this summer i'll get the
chance
he thought
if
clint could think of
a
project for his
farm club
he just might win
the club gave ribbons for the best projects
clint s
cl
clint needed a
good idea
was getting the family
garden ready
for spring
planting
clint always
helped her
he loved
to dig in
the dirt
and plant
seeds the best
part was watching the seeds sprout
as
as clint worked
in the garden
he got a great idea
why don't
why don't don't i try to grow something
all by myself
i could enter th
what i grow as my project for
the
farm club
clint went to
look for his father he found
a he found him
working
in the barn
in the barn
dad can i talk to you for a minute
clint asked sure
clint said
his father his father
what can i do for you well
do
well do your
do your
is that supposed to say you or your
well y do you remember
that
blue ribbon you won
at the fair
i really want to win one too said clint
clint
i was thinking maybe
i could
grow something all by myself to enter the fair
i wonder
what kinds of seeds
could plant
could i
seeds i could plant
plant
finished clint
go get the seed basket
take
a look at
what's in here said dad
whatever seeds you choose i'll be glad to help
clint looked at the seed
packets
at
at the bottom of the basket was a
packet
o
packet marked
marked
sweet
corn
when clint
saw those
when
clint saw those words
he could
almost taste the wonderful corn
this is this is it dad
i'm going
to grow sweet corn
blue ribbon sweet corn
dad smiled
to see clint so excited
you'd
better
read the directions
dad said
growing
good corn
takes
a lot of work
clint
read the directions
on the seed packet
one plant sweet
sweet corn in
early may
to get the ground ready for planting
three plant seeds in a sunny
sunny spot four plant seeds in
in straight rows
five water seeds once a day
we
if it doesn't if it does not rain
if it does not rain
six the corn should be fully grown in eighty five days
i think i can do
do it
dad
said clint
good said dad
today is may
first you'd better start now
you can use the small
plot
by your mother's garden to plant your crop
that afternoon clint
planted the corn seeds
in four neat rows
spring turned into summer the days past quickly
when it didn't rain clint remembered to water his corn
soon the green
soon the green shoots were growing tall and straight
slowly long leaves grew out of
the s
i can't really read that word right there
stalks
by by july the plants were as tall as
clint
it's time to watch for
that words hard right there
y your corn plants
said dad
dad answered
they grow on top of the corn
stalk
dust called pollen
your corn plants need
pollen to grow
ears
to grow ears of corn
the wind helps corn pollen fall over the plant
clint looked at his
corn plants how does
pollen help the plants
s
strings of corn silk
hang out
of each corn
what does that word say
husk
these
s
strings catch the pollen
said dad
they take
it into it into the cob
where the
kernels
grow will grow
there is one string of corn
silk
for each kernel
when the pollen reaches
the
cob
the kernels
begin to grow
every day clint
checked his plants
plants for
tassels
he wondered if
if the wind would blow
enough
pollen into the corn silk
one afternoon clint found his dad in
the fields
dad he said
i'm worried
that
not enough pollen will fall
on the corn silk
well said dad
sometimes the wind doesn't blow enough pollen
onto the silk
silk
then
the farmer was
has to help
you
want your corn to be especially
good
maybe you should
think up a way
to sprinkle the pollen
on to the silk yourself
clint
thought and thought finally
he
looked at some of his parents farming
magazines
an an hour later
clint ran to his
corn
corn plants he had found a way
to spread the pollen
first he put a brown paper bag
over a
held the bag shut at the bottom carefully
then he shook the plant the pollen
into the bag finally
finally clint took the bag off the
sprinkled the pollen on the corn silk
of each ear
soon the silk and
husks
of each plant were covered with pollen
it was long hard work
but clint was happy
he had solved a problem just like a real farmer
over the next few weeks the corn grew quickly
clint worked in his rows everyday finally he marked off the last
of the eighty five days
that morning
he picked three ears
of
of corn
these ears are the best he said
al entered them in the fair
went the fairy when the fair was done was over clint came home a took out his special box
he smiled as he slid a new blue
ribbon next to his father's now there were two blue ribbons in the family
uhm this story was about he wanted to read a he wanted to win a fair and he couldn't so he asked his dad if he can uhm uhm get some seeds and then he found uhm seeds for corn and then he planted corn
and then once he planted it it w it got as tall as him and then he was trying to figure out a way for the corn to grow faster so he found out a way to put a brown bag over the
<br>
plants and shake the plants and then the plants would go all the pollen would go in the bag and he can dump all the pollen all over the uhm plants and then he can
and then he try he h he thought it was good enough so he went to the fair and then he and then he won the fair and then he got a blue ribbon and he put it next to his dad's
the tie
the boy and the nuts
the boy and the nuts modified by taylor
a glass jar full of nuts was on a table albert who loved nuts saw it
he climbed up on the table and put his hand
into the jar he grabbed a whole handful
then he tried to pull his ha
his hand out the mouth of the jar was too small
small for his fit he pulled and pulled and became very angry at the jar
but it was no use his hand was stuck
should i read over again
at last he began to scream and and cry his mother ran to the room
ran to the room to see what was wrong with him
what's a matter albert she asked this mean old jar will not let me have this handful of nuts cried albert
his mother laughed when she saw the cause of his trouble you greedy boy you don't f need a whole handful at once she said try taking a few at a time
albert let go of the nuts and took only two his hand came out easily when you get into trouble ian stop and think of a way to fit it instead of screaming said his mother and next time don't be so greedy

do you know what a brahman is a brahman is a very good and gentle kind of man who lives in india and who treats all the animals as if they were his brothers
what but this is enough for this story
one day a brahman was looking on a country road when he came upon a tiger shut up in a strong iron cage the villagers had caught him and shut him up there for being wicked
oh brother brahman
brother brahman said the tiger please let me out to get a little drink
i am so thirsty and there's no water here but brother tiger said brahman you know if i let you out you would jump on me and eat me up
never brother brahman said tiger
never in the world would i do such a bad thing just let me out
out a little minute to get a little little drink of water please brother
brahman
so the brahmin unlocked the door and let the tiger out
tiger out the moment he was out he jumped on the brahmin and was about to eat him up
but brother tiger said brahmin you promised you would not
you would not it is not fair for
for
where was i
for you to eat me when i set you free
it is perfectly right
and i will eat you up said the tiger but brahmin argued so hard that a last
at last the tiger agreed to wait they would ask the first the first five people they met we whether it was fair for him to eat the brahmin if they decided it was right the brahmin would let the tiger eat him
i don't know why you would let somebody eat you
the first thing they came to
to to ask was an old
banyan tree and the road
a banyan
a banyan tree is a kind of fruit tree
brother br banyan said the
brahmin
eagerly does it seem to you right that this
tiger should eat me when
i set him free from his cage
the brahmin
and
and spoke in
in a tired voice in the summer he said when the sun is hot men come and sit in the
cool of my shade and eat my fruit off my branches but then evening comes
and they are rested
they break my wings at
brahmin
the tiger sprang to the brahmin
him but the brahmin said wait wait
brahmin and brahmin
i'm mixed up on those two words
which of them means
the tiger sprang to eat the brahmin but the brahmin said wait wait
we have asked only one
we have still four to ask then they came to a place where a old bull was lying by the road
the brahmin went up to him and said brother bull oh brother bull does it seem to you
a fair thing that this tiger should eat me up
after i have just
freed him from the cage
the bull looked up
and said in a deep grumbling voice when i was young and strong my master used my h
my hard
used me hard i served him well i carried heavy loads and carried them far now that i am old and weak i cannot
work
he leaves me without food or water
thank
thankless
let the tiger eat the brahmin
computer at home but i don't it has like games you can play
the tiger jumped but the brahmin spoke very quickly oh but this is only the second brother tiger
you promised to ask five
the tiger grumbled
a good deal
but at last he went on again with the brahmin and after a time they saw an eagle flying in the sky
the brahmin called up to him oh brother eagle
tell
us if it seems fair that this tiger should eat me up when i have just saved him from a a frightful cage the eagle soared slowly overhead a moment then he came lower
and he spoke in a
thin clear voice i have
i live here in the air he said and i do not
i do no man any harm yet when
they
yet
yet when men find my babies they st they stone
my young and rob my
my nest and shoot at
me with arrows men are cruel let the tiger eat the brahmin
the tiger jumped up
jumped on the brahmin to eat him up this time the brahmin had to work very hard to keep him off
at last the tiger stopped
and they walked on together in a little while they saw an old alligator he was lying in a mud and slime
and
slime and
slime at the river's edge brother alligator
oh brother alligator said the brahmin does it seem right to you that this tiger wants to eat me up
when have when i have just let him out of a cage the old alligator turned
in the mud and grunted and snorted then he said i lie here in the mud all day as harmless as a bird
i hunt no man but every d time i see
sees me he throws stones at me and pokes me with sharp sticks men are worthless let the tiger eat the brahmin
and this tiger and at and this the tiger tried to eat the brahman
at once
the poor brahman had to re remind him again and again that
that they had asked only four wait til we ask one more wait until we see a fifth he begged
finally the tiger walked on with him after a time
they met the little jackal coming happily down the road toward them
oh brother jackal dear brother jackal said the brahman get us your optional
do you think it
it
is fair that this tiger t tiger should eat me when i set him free from a terrible cage excuse said the little jackal
i said i said yelled the brahman do you think it would
is fair that the tiger should eat me when i set him free from his cage
cage said the little jackal yes yes his cage
said the brahman we want you to know what you think do you think oh said the jackal you want me o
my optional
what
opinion
opinion
they may a
they may i ask you two speak a little more loudly and be more clear i'm a little slow now that now what was it
do you think said the brahman it is right for the tiger to eat me when i set him free from his cage
what cage said little jackal
why the cage he was in said the jack said the brahman i m you see but i don't understand said the little jackal
you set him free you say
yes yes yes said the brahmin i went this way i was walking along
and i saw the tiger oh dear oh dear said the ja little jackal
i'll never understand talk like that
with a long story if you really want my op
opinion
make it clear
what sort of cage was it
cage was it
why a big plain cage on
an iron one said the brahmin
that gives me no idea at all said little jackal listen my friends if we are going to get to the bottom of this you'd better show me the spot then
then i can understand in a jiffy
show me the cage so then the brahmin and the tiger and the little jackal walked back together to the spot where the cage where the cage was now let me see if
if
i get this said the little jackal brahmin there
there you were
there you were said the little jackal
wait a minute where was i
brahmin
there
there were you i stood by the roadside said the brahmin
and tiger
where were you said the little jackal why in the cage of course roared the tiger well excuse me mister tiger said the little jackal i'm really
s
am i so silly i cannot quite understand
what happened you need to just
just
you need to have just a little patient
patience
how were you in the cage what p
position were you in
oh i'm so sorry said the little jackal i know i w i am very slow i never understand things well unless i see just how they ar were if you would just show me how the doors works
yes but i don't see any lock said the little jackal does it lock on the outside
it locks like this said the brahmin and he shut the bolted door
oh does it really said the little jackal does it really well brother brahmin now that now that it is locked i think you should tell let it stay locked
as for you my friend he said to the tiger i think you'll wait a good while before you find anyone to let you out again then he bowed to the brahmin goodbye brother he said you
you got that way and i'll go this way
you go that way and i'll go this way goodbye
i can remember that uhm that the boy liked nuts alot and he found some nut jar full of them and he thought he would take he thought it would be good to like just take a hand full instead of just like a few
but then when he tried to take it out his hand was too big to get through the hole so he had to let a few nuts go out
so he could just squeeze so he could get his hand through
sil
and then he could like go back and get more
well the tiger and the brahman were like mostly kind of the main characters and the brahman walked along the road one day and he saw a tiger trapped in a cage and so he thought that the tiger would uhm help him
sil
uhm help him like do something not really help him but the brahman wanted to be nice and let the animal out of the cage because it was he thought it would be mean to let an animal live in a cage so he let him out but the
and he said first that he had to be he promised he would not eat the uhm man so the braham uhm let him out but he pounced on him and he was about to eat him
when they decided uhm that they would uhm sh ask five people their opinions what they would think uhm who should who should be winning
and so uhm
sil
they asked a tree and then he said uhm that the tiger should eat the brahman and then they asked let me see
sil
what was it
sil
they asked
sil
tree
i don't remember the other ones i think it was a
sil
eagle a alligator
sil
that was three
sil
yeah
sil
so uhm and then after they uhm found the tree they talked to him and he thought uhm no they should just let the tiger eat the uhm brahman and then the
sil
the the cow thought that he should uhm be eaten the brahman be eaten by the tiger and the eagle thought that he should be eaten by the the tiger should be eat the brahman and then
the alligator also thought that uhm that the brahman should be eaten by the tiger
and then the jackal thought that the
sil
uhm man should not be eaten
because he was like they must have been like friends somehow and the jackal knew the man and he was like helping him out
and then so
sil
uhm he made him think that the tiger uhm thought that the jackal needed like help thinking what it was like but the jackal actually tricked all that made that all up so he tricked him
and i was thinking that was coming that he was going to be tricked and then back in the story it said uhm something and then it forget is
sil
i think it was like cutoff
are who had
worked
hard all his life was
sick he knew that he wouldn't
die
soon
he
he
ca
he would
die soon
he called his three sons to his bed to
give them some

they wanted to make money fast

jeff gripped the chain
with one quick push of the pedal the chain wrapped around the gear there he said
to his friend mike now try it
mike rode the bicycle down the driveway and circled back toward jeff
gee thanks he said
it's it's like a brand new bike jeff grinned
he liked fixing things then he looked up just in time to see his new puppy running up the hill mom he cried
there goes puddles can we go after him on our bikes
jeff's mom looked out the window yes but come home in
time to do your homework
rememb
remember you must turn in your ideas for your science fair project tomorrow
the boys jumped on their bikes and
headed up the hill they saw
puddles up up ahead
his golden ears flopped up and down as
as he ran over the hilltop
the boys pushed harder at at the pedals as they climbed the steep hill
change your gears mike yelled jeff jeff wash
watched
as mike's chain slipped over a larger gear
thanks jeff
at the top of the hill the boys stopped that catch their breath
to catch their breath
mike was puzzled jeff why did
shifting make it easier to pedal
i don't know
it's got something to do with the gears answered jeff
i'm just glad that we won't need to pedal so hard going down the hill
the boys looked down the hill
below
c
they could
they could see
the ruler the roller coaster in the new jeff
ma news amusement park
the park was called fun station look
look at those hills mike i'll bet
look at those hills mike i'll bet we would
need some big gears to climb them and strong legs too added mike jeff looked down the fun station
since there was puddles digging under the gate oh no he groaned
mom said the fun station was off limits until it opens next summer the boys
coasted down the hill
all other uphill
pedaling pad at off paid off
jeff wondered how fast they would they were going and he imagined how fast he could go
on the roller coaster jeff and mike squeezed their hand brakes to slow down
when they reached the
fence jeff dropped to his knees and peered through the hole
a new story
oh
puddles was nowhere in sight
puddles puddles mike and jeff shouted but puddles did not return
then over the sounds of the workers they heard a familiar bark from the other side of the fence a woman spoke have you lost your dog yes cried jeff
do you have puddles well
said the woman i don't know if it's puddles but i have a friendly little co cocker spaniel here
that's puddles
cried jeff
cried jeff
can you make him come back through this hole the woman laughed
here it will be easier for puddles if i open the gate
in a few minutes puddles was in jeff's
jeff's arms
jeff hugged him hard
puddles wiggled to get free but
but jeff wasn't about to let him escape again
jeff looked at the woman thank you for bringing puddles out no problem said the woman
my name's lisa
i'm one of the engineers building the great gravity machine
i was playing with puddles when i heard you call
what's the great gravity machine asked jeff
that's the name of the roller coaster lisa pointed toward a big steel hills wow it's huge said mike
i can see way
i can see why they call it it great but what about gravity
well gravity is a force a force pushes or pulls things
pulls things
where did i go
hmm oh
pulls things explained lisa
on a roller coaster the cars are the attached
a
attached to a chin chain that wraps around gears when an a range
turns the gears the chain pulls the cars up the first hill
first hill is always the highest one
when the cars reach the top the force gravity pulls them down the hill
when they reach the bottom the cars are going fast enough to get up the next hill by by themselves yeah jeff nodded gravity is why the coaster so f fast down the hill on our on our bikes
that's right lisa replied
our your bicycle and the roller coaster both use gravity

ramon
and right sat on the back porch of their new home they had moved to the country just two weeks ago
ramon still missed the city
he missed their old school he missed playing with his friends on their street
rita
finished tying
string into
onto a kite
what a great day for flying a kite
she smiled
she smiled at her brother just listen to the wind in the trees
i hate the country ramon said it's too quiet here it's not so quiet said rita
there are lots of
sounds they're just not the same kinds of sounds that you hear in new york
just listen ramon
ramon listened
he heard birds singing
he heard cowbells ringing from the farm the down the road
he heard the soft sound of wind
blowing through the trees
then they heard something strange
what was that asked rita
i don't know ramon
ramon looked around
the porch
he saw nothing but some empty bottles i think
the house is
groaning whispered rita
maybe it's
wind
maybe it's the wind said ramon
the sound stopped when the wind stops
it starts when the wind blows
it's house that's it's the house that that's making the noise i don't like it ramon said
ramon said rita the wind blew
they heard the sound again
this time ramon knew what it was
ramon walked over to the empty bottle bottles and
s
on the porch
and rita followed followed this he picked up a bottle and blew across
the top of it
there it was that strange sound
so that's
so that's what's been making those
odd noises said a voice behind them
their mother was standing out at the door
why does the bottle make that sound
mom
asked rita she felt silly for thinking
that
that the house had
groaned
come inside
said their mother
we can talk while i work
ramon and rita picked up
the bottles and followed her
and followed their mother into the house
several boxes sat on the kitchen floor mom was top came
taking dishes out of
one box and putting them away when you blow across the top of a bottle
mom explained the air inside the bottle vibrates
what does vibrate mean asked ramon well the air inside the bottle moves back and forth and
back and forth very quickly
mom answered these movements are called
vibration
vibrations
dad came into the room
look kids he said i can show you what vibrations
are
he held a rubber band
in
his hand
dad pulled the rubber band tight between
two fingers
pull the rubber band
ri rita said
rita
he said
and then let go
ramon watched rita pull
ramon watched
uhm it was about uhm a little
donkey and they were going out to the market and the farmer told the little donkey to carry the two
big bags and
the donkey got tired and uhm
uhm the donkey fell and she couldn't get up again cause she was probably too tired to and
so she asked
so the donkey asked the horse if uhm
she if he or she would do uhm it for her but uhm the horse said she uhm
the horse said to the donkey that uhm he wouldn't do it and uhm
that's about it
i don't really know what he was sad about but
so
uhm it was about this girl and a boy they lived in new york but they moved to this home uhm and then they heard this uhm
<br>
they heard this noise and it and they thought it was like uhm the house groaning but it was just the bottles and the wind was vibrating on the bottles so uhm it made this really weird sound and the chimney is sort of like the same thing except it's sort of like a giant bottle like uhm they said in the story and uhm yeah
start
hey what's that word next
julio
did you hear
there's going to be a race four weeks
said
drake to his friend
i'm going to the race
in it and i'm going to win
julio laughed at drake and said oh really
prove it
i'll race you to my house and
we'll see who wins
ready set go shouted drake
the two boys ran as fast as they could
at first they were running at the same speed
he's not it great
he's not so great thought julio but after a while drake was
far ahead of julio
drake turned and shouted told you
told you
i'm going to win the race
you might as we
you might as
well not even sign up julio
julio was mad
he could hardly catch his breath
his body felt tired when he got home he slammed the door behind him
what's wrong
his big sister
elena asked there's going to be a big race
drake
drake is
going
to beat me
he beats
me at every
everything julio said sally
elena had an idea
why don't you train for the race
how do that julio asked
asked
come
to the track practice tomorrow
you can talk to my coach i'm sure you can
i i'm s i'm sure she can help you said elena
the next day julio went to see coach benson
the if you want to be a better runner
there are three things you should
do she said
first
you should run for fifteen minutes every day
how will that help asked julio
when you run used for a lot
muscles in your body explained coach
benson
your muscles aren't used to
r
used to running
if you
if you run a little every day your muscles get stronger
muscles are
muscles are
muscles that are in
muscles that are
exercised can work
longer
without getting tired
ok said julio what else can i do
in a race y
you not only want to be
able to run and get tired you also want to run fast said coach benson
so the said
so
so the
second thing you should
do is
some
s
s
springing
sprinting
you should do it every other day do you know what sprinting means
do julio
thought for a moment he had never heard that word before
i don't think so coach he said
pick at a spot that
is not too far away
race to it as fast as you can
rest for a minute then race back where you started
that's what sprinting means
do that for
four times explained coach benson
and don't forget to warm up before you run
that is the third important thing to do your sister
your sister can
show you how
julio looked at elena what
does warm up mean he asked warming up means doing stretching exercises elena said
stretch your muscles muscles that
haven't been stretched can get hurt
it it is always good to stretch before running
ok big sister
show me that to
show me what to do said julio
for the next four weeks julio went to the park every day
training for the race was not easy
sometimes he
he didn't feel like
running but he made himself to
he always stretch his muscles before he ran
every other day julio worked on his speed
he could choose a tree not too far away and race to it he could rest by counting to sixty
then he would run
back to where he started
then he'd
he
do it over again
each time he
practiced sprinting
he thought of
of what it would be like
when he beat drake in the big race
at first julio found it hard to run he was out of breath
he could feel his heart pounding on his chest
but
but as the days
passed he ran
he ran longer and farther without getting tired
his muscles got stronger
the
the stronger he got the more he could
could run
he used his watch to time himself
as he knew what
he was getting faster
he was happy at how he
was doing
now he
ran his
he he ran his heart beat steady
every day he wrote down in his notebook how much he had run
finally the day of the big race came everyone in school was at the track
the runners lined up to start
drake turned to julio and said and said i'm surprised that you even
you're even here
i'm the one who will win
who will win
this race
julio didn't say anything
he was too busy warming up
at last the big moment came
the principal
of the school called
out on your mark get set
go
the race was on
as quickly as they could drake
another runner
named beth took the lead suddenly drake started to slow down
it
he was tired
out
of breath as they raced around the track julio sped
past drake
but beth was the only runner ahead of julio
he poured on the speed
but so did beth
now julio
understood why the coach had told him to practice springing
as the two runners crossed the finish line
julio broke the tape
beth was
was a close second
julio
beamed
at the principal placed
the principal placed a medal around his neck
he had r
ran

beaten drake
julio

every four years turtles from all over the land would crawl to
a great pond
it would take some turtles from far away villages two whole
weeks just to get there
when all the turtles arrived
there was a s
a seven day festival called the shell
dwellers
festival where there was lots of eating and laughing
turtles could catch up with friends that hadn't that they had not seen since the last festival
everything about the festival was fun
but the main event was the
the great turtle race
the winner of the great turtles turtle race
was the so important that he or she didn't have to move
for four years until the next festival
the less
the less a turtle moves the bigger they get and the longer they live
so you can see winning the great race is a great honor
the turtle cup
was the of the trophy that the winner would take take home to their village
it had been
in
sludge pond
o for over fifty years because no one could ever beat their turtle
this a was the most famous turtle there was
was the slowest turtle of all time
he hadn't
had to move for
over fifty years he was the biggest most
respected and also one of the trickiest turtles there was
there were many legends about him
rumored he was so slow his heart would only beat once a day
his name was mud and he
and he was the greatest champion in the history of
this shell dweller's festival he was unbeatable
when
when mud was in his prime there was
a new turtle born in blue pond
this turtle was named swish
when swish was born everyone thought he was a little slow but as he got a little older the turtles began to realize
that swish was really really slow
once his mother called him
in for dinner and
and he didn't make it it home until breakfast the next morning
and he was only a foot away
blue pond was a nice village located about three days crawl from great pond
they all felt a little sad because they hadn't held it the turtle cup in over a
a seven hundred years
so with a s s with swish
they thought maybe just maybe he could bring back the turtle cup
to their little pond
everyone treated swish differently for example mr peeks
the local shell cleaner would say hey there swish do you want a free shell waxing
today we all want you to look good when you bring home the cup
mrs snapper would say
hi swishy
do you want some yummy pie to fill you up
up and slow you down for the big race
a fat turtle is
a slow turtle
mr snapper
was never nice to anyone but
she was being nice to swish mr peeks would never do anything for free
but he was going to give swish a free shell waxing
this was the kind of thing that swish would get all the time
all the extra attention made swish very uncomfortable
he thought sure
he thought sure they are nice to me now because they think i can
win the race but if i
lose they'll be disappointed and mad at me
i'll never i never promised
promised that
i would win the race
i can't beat mud anyway i heard once it took him three days just to yawn
so one day
he told his parents i don't want to race
all the turtles in blue pond held
a meeting
to discuss the problem
said this is ridiculous swish has a r to ra has to race he's the slowest turtle i've every seen
except for mud of course without him
we don't have
we don't have a chance
but
he doesn't want to be treated special
he just wants to be normal and he doesn't want everybody
to
hate him if he can't beat mud
you have to remember
at being slow he's still very young and swish's father
l said swish's father
we never thought of
all th we never thought of that
they all said they all said
wh the town agreed to s treat swish like a normal turtle and after a while swish decided that he would be proud to
race for his village
when the time
of the festival drew near all the turtles in
the land started toward
the great pond swish had to be carried
on his father's back since it would have taken him months to get to great pond by himself
finally after the long journey all the turtles arrived at great pond
this was swish's first
ever shell dwellers festival and
he thought it was the most wonderful thing he had ever seen
there were thousands of turtles of all different species
all
having a great time
look there's your cousin
peek a boo from big puddle village
said swish's mother you'll get to meet all sorts of new turtles swish was suddenly very excited he told his mom you know what
i'm going to win this race i know it
and all these turtles will know that
blue pond rules
i'm not afraid of stupid mud
swish's mom smiled and said
i know that
you can win swish but it's an honor just to
get to race said swish's mom
swish saw a rock in the middle of
the field it and wondered
how come they don't have
that big
rock out of the field
it seemed to be in everyone's way said swish
that's not a rock sweetie said his mom
that's mud swish m swish m made a loud gulp sound
just d do your best said mom
swishes father
said son i have something to tell you
as you know th your great
great
grand turtle
raced mud once he wasn't as slow as you
but he did teach about
he did teach about mud's dirty
tricks
and then he whispered in swish's ear all the tricks that his great great grand turtle taught him
after seven days of playing and dancing
and bug eating finally the day of the race came
the mayor of great pond
mrs mrs tort
pow
pa posted
the rules of the race on a tree f for everyone to see
rule
r chapter
oh
rule rule number one the great race begins a at sunrise and ends at sunset
rule number two all turtles must
run as fast as they can
and the turtle that is the closest to
the starting line wins
rule number three
no turtle may pretend to be going fast but
go slow instead all turtle
instead
all turtle
must go
all turtles must go as fast as
they can
a they can at all times
since turtles that
since turtles never cheat this is the most important rule
to break this rule
would mean an end the great turtle race forever
rule number four
no turtle must m
no turtle may fall asleep since if you're
you are asleep you aren't running as fast as you can
swish
set swish read the rules even though he knew them by heart
then he heard the mayor say runner's please take your pos
positions the slowest turtles
from each pond were carried to the starting line by members of their village
villages
there were carried
by
members of their villages there were about three hundred turtles racing they were all the slowest of the slow
the the turtles all stretched and thought
really slow
thoughts as they as they did the sky turned from black
to dark blue
they looked at at the horizon and saw the sun was starting the rise
just then the mayor said ready set slow
and off they went
all the turtles were very very slow
so it look
so it took some time
before anyone could figure out which turtles were
the slowest
after a few hours most of the turtles had gone
a few feet
all except two swish and mud were still
were
were both both back at the starting line
it looked as if
neither of them had moved at all
they were both moving of course but
they were so slow that it was hard to tell
after six hours mud and swish were still tied
and had only moved a few inches
by now all the turtles were usually way ahead of mud
but this time swish was just as slow
mud knew that his wo
that this
would be his closest race ever and he was
actually getting a little bit scared
who is this young
punk
he he thought to himself
mud said to swish there's no way that a turtle as young as you can
be a so slow
even i was faster than you when i was your age
you're you're cheating
you're going to run
ruin the great race forever
but swish wouldn't let mud scare him you're just trying to make me quit i'm not going to fall for your tricks he said
turtles
never cheat and i'm
a turtle with honor
said mud try
said then then mud tried another trick he started singing a soft beautiful
s song
a soft beautiful lullaby
swish started yawning he was
tired from racing
a and thought that
it would be nice just to listen to mud's sweet voice and fall asleep
then he snapped
out of it and remembered his father and warned
himself
him
of his of his this trick
he reached
all of h h this his shell
and pulled a
out a couple of earplugs
the
the
the put
the earplugs
the put doesn't make really sense but the put the earplugs
in his ears and couldn't hear mud's singing anymore
mud kept
singing his lullaby for a few
hour hours but
but
he stopped right before sunset
the crowd thought
he must have realized that his singing trick wasn't working
but then right as
the end be right before the sunset swish started to pull
ahead of mud
oh no shouted the fans mud's winning
it looks like mud's mud is still the greatest turtle of them all and when
the sunset went down mud was the closest turtle to the starting line
swish was sad that he lost but all
the turtles from blue pond cheered for swish
they were very proud he gave
mud such a close race swish was happy too
but
deep down inside he knew he he was just as slow as mud
the mayor of
pondland went to the present
the turtle cup
to sludge pond again
she announced well mud
it looks like you've done it
sludge pond wins the turtle cup again this time it was a bit closer than you would have liked i'll bet
what you
what you would h you like to say to all the turtles at the festival
the crowd started yelling speech speech
the mayor tapped mud on
the shell and sa said
hello hello mud
mud still didn't answer in fact mud was sound asleep
mud had at actually s sung himself to sleep
ladies and gentlemen
disqualified for sleeping during the race this means that we
have a new champion the
the real winner is swish softbelly from
blue pond the crowd went wild
mrs tort went up
to swish and gave him the turtle cup
she said swish
are you are the youngest winner of
the great turtle race what
that was the most
exciting finish we've ever
had i think that you'll be a great champion for many years since turtles only
get
slower with age
for with the time in six hundred years i would like to present the turtle cup to blue pond
the crowd went wild again
swish took the cup
that
day for
the first time he would take it it many more times after it was because of swish that blue pond became the most respected
pond in the land
he would never a lose the turtle cup for
the rest of his long life
but thou though he became the greatest and biggest turtle
of all time greater
or bigger than mud
always m he always made sure that no one
no one treated him special and
that he treated everybody like he wanted to be treated like a turtle with honor
uhm
sil
sludge pond was the all time champ champion of the
sil
cup
sil
the cup that the race yeah and uhm the
sil
they were so nervous about trying to beat sludge pond that some people started treating swish differently then other people because he they thought he was going to win and uhm every but he decided he wanted to be treated like another person and a normal turtle and
then when he tried to win the race sludge pond mud got disqualified because he fell asleep during the race
and then blue pond ended up being the all time champion and for many more years swish became the biggest and the greatest turtle of all time
once upon a time a tortoise lived in a pond with two ducks
they were
her very good friends she liked the ducks she could talk with them as much as she liked the tortoise liked to talk
she liked
to
she liked the sound of her voice the tortoise and the ducks lived
together for a long time
then the pond ran
out of water the ducks and the tortoise had no water to swim in the two ducks could not live without water they were going to fly away to more water they went to the tortoise to say goodbye
oh don't leave me said the tortoise take me with you i will die if
i stay here but you can not fly said the ducks
how can we take you with us take me with you take me with you said the tortoise the ducks felt bad they had an idea of how to take her
we have
have a way to take you they said
but you must not move
we will each take one end of a stick
you
take the middle of your mouth
then you
will fly up in the air with you
but do not to talk
if you open your mouth you will fall
the tortoise said she would not
say a word
she
would not even
move her mouth she was very happy
so they got
so the ducks got a strong stick and
held the ends the tortoise bit the middle then the two ducks flew away with their friend
they were high over the trees the tortoise want to say
how high
we are but she could not talk
the stick was in her mouth
so she kept still
they saw a pretty house
she wanted to say what is that
but she kept quiet
then they came to a town
people looked up and saw them look at the
ducks carrying a tortoise they said everyone ran to look the tortoise wanted to say be quiet
but she did not
that is funny look at that look they said the tortoise forgot t the stick
she opened her mouth to say
hush she fell to the ground that was the end of
the tortoise it was very good to be able to be quiet
uhm a tortoise and two ducks were
sil
were in a p were living at a pond and the pond dried up and the ducks couldn't live there so they had to fly away and they bring and the tortoise didn't want them to leave so the
so they uhm so the ducks took so so the ducks took had an idea to take them him with them by taking a stick and both of them holding on to it with their feet and then the tortoise would hold onto it with their mouth with this mouth and when they got to the
sil
when they got to a town he saw a building but he wanted to say what was that but he remembered that he couldn't open his mouth but when he got to the town everybody kept staring at him and shouting so he opened his mouth and said something
sil
and he fell off the stick and the birds said that that was the end of him
don't forget
to feed your fish called
tom's mother
tom would never get to feel his fish
he took
he took very good care of them
they were the first pets
he had gotten
them for his birthday
he loved to watch them swim
and play in their bowl
he gave them both names
the gold one was named
melvin
the black one
he called
and i'll feed them mom called tommy
but something was wrong
they just don't
look right
i don't know much about fish
tom said
his mother as she came into his room
but i think
you are right why don't you go to the pet store
maybe someone there can tell
you what's wrong
can i help you asked the man at the pet store
i think
my goldfish
are sick said tommy
well maybe i can help
tell me about your goldfish said the man
the man said
i have two fish said tom eat
my name is tommy
glad to meet you
my name is mr chu
they
don't seem to be happy said tommy
tom
when i i got them
two weeks ago they swam
a lot faster
and
do
than they do now
i think that they may be sick
do you feel do you the feed your fish
tommy asked mr chu
yes sir
i put just a little food on the top of their water
i like to watch them swim
to the top and eat
they make funny faces when they eat
then they wiggle and swim away
tom said
it sounds like you're
it sounds like you are
feeding them just right
just them right way
it's good
that
it's good that
that you take care of your pets
said mr chu
why don't we look at the fish in
in here
in here in the store
you can show me what kind of goldfish
you like to have
that might be that might help us find out what's wrong with your pet
pets
tom and chu walked back to the pet store
tom looked f for
fish that
the
tank
where f
the tank where full of all kinds of fish
they were also
filled with bubbles why don't you put bubbles in their fish tank
asked tom
he looks like the fish is taking a bubble bath
is
those bubbles are filled with air
explained mr chu
fish need to breath air
just like people do you keep
the f
do you keep
our fish healthy we clean
their air and water
we use it
an air pump to freshen their tank
the air pumps
pump makes the bubbles
how does the water get clean asked tom
the air pumped
push the air pump pushes the water through
and after
answered mr chu
the
filter works like a net
and it
traps the dirt
collects in the water
when the water comes out of the
pump it cleans
tom
and
tom looked at the fish
but he couldn't stop thinking about the bubbles
mr chu why are the some bubbles big
why are some small
some bubbles have more
air in them
than other bubbles
a bubble holds air just like a balloon said mr chu
the more air you blow
into a balloon the bigger it gets
tom looked at the bubbles in the fish tank
my
fishbowl doesn't have an air pump he said
there are no bubbles
of
air in the water
it's why my fish are s
no why my fish are sick
maybe mr chu
how often do you change the water in the bowl
i haven't changed it said tom
if you don't use a pump you must change
change the water twice a week
said mr chu
when you give
your fish
fresh in the water
they'll start to feel better
they will get plenty of air to breathe
thank you mr chu said tom i want to
i want
i want my fish to be happy and healthy
it's
are lucky to have such a good friend like you
said mr chu as he waved goodbye to tom
uhm
sil
well first he gets the fish and then they swim really fast and then like a week later er somewhere in the week the fish start they don't feel well and they kind of swim slower and they don't eat as well
sil
and then he goes to uhm the pet store and he asks the pet keeper how to fix uhm the problem and he tells him to change the water twice a week so the fish will swim faster and feel better and eat better
one day a long long time ago it was very
cold
winter was coming and all the birds flew away to the warm south there there they would wait for the spring
but one little bird had a broken wing and he could not fly he did not know what to do he looked all around to see if there was any place where he could keep warm
he saw
the trees of the big forest maybe the trees will keep me warm through the winter he said so he went to the forest hopping and fluttering with his broken wing
the first tree he came to was a silver
birch
beautiful birch tree he said will you let me live in your warm branches until the springtime comes oh my said the birch what a thing to ask i have to take care of my own leaves through the winter go away
the little bird hop
hopped and fluttered with his broken wing until he came to the next tree it was a great big oak tree
oh big oak tree said the little bird
will y you let me
live in your warm branches until the springtime comes
what a th
what a thing to ask said the oak tree if you stay in my branches
all winter you will be eating my acorns go away
so the little bird
hopped and fluttered with his broken wing until he came to the willow tree by the edge of the brook
oh willow tree he said said the little bird will you let me live in your warm branches until the springtime comes no said the willow tree i never talk to strangers go away
the poor little bird did not know where to go but he hopped and fluttered along with his broken wing
the spruce tree saw him and said where are you going little bird
i do not know said the bird the trees will not let me live in
live with them and my wing is broken and i cannot fly
you may live on my branches said the sparrow
said the s
spruce here is the warmest one of all
but may i stay all winter yes said the spruce i will not
i will like to have you
the pine tree was stood beside the
the spruce when he saw the little bird hopping and fluttering with his broken wing he said
but branches are not very warm but i can keep the wind off because i am strong
so the little bird fluttered up into the warm branch of this spruce
then the pine tree
keep kept the wind off his
house
then the j
juniper tree saw what the pine and spruce were doing she said that she would give the little bird
his dinner for the winter from her branches
the trees
the trees at the edge of the forest talked to each other i wouldn't take
care of a strange bird said the birch i would
risk my acorn acorns said the oak
i would not talk to strangers the willow
and all and the three trees stood up very tall and proud
that night the north wind came into the woods to play he blew at the leaves with his icy breath
and every leaf he touched fell to the ground
he wanted to touch ev
every leaf in the forest he loved to see the trees bark
he loved to see the trees bare
may i touch every leaf he said to his father the forest king no said the forest king the trees
which
the trees which were kind to the bird
will
the trees which were kind to the bird will
the broken wing may keep their leaves
so north wind had to leave them alone
this
the spruce the pine and the
juniper
and the
juniper tree kept their leaves through all the winter and they have
and they have done so ever since
uhm well the little bird uhm had a broken wing and so he asked all the tr
sil
some trees if he could stay in their leaves and they said no then a tree saw him walking with no where to go and
sil
it invited him to live in his leaves then the other ones felt
sil
uhm
sil
bad that they didn't let him in their trees so they came and helped the
sil
uhm spruce tree
sil
i mean
sil
the tree who took him in
sil
and then the wind father's said that he couldn't blow all their leaves off and then uhm
sil

maria was proud of the plane
plan she had
drawn
she had even signed
her name
at the bottom
but she still needed some
advice from the
question
found
that
<unk>
france was an
engine engineer
she had know the best place to build
the clubhouse
france was staying at
the rise beach while she studied
earthquakes she was also studying how to build buildings that
would not fall down in an earthquake
do you you like it
maria asked
as france s
spread out the plan
on the kitchen table
it's the
plan okay
where
should
my friends and i build
our clubhouse
on
one question
at a time france laughed
you have a good plan but
the walls should be made of wood
not bricks
but
dad and i dug up the bricks from the
old
p
patio
they're still good
maria explained
it's great to re
use
ruse
ranch
ruse
reuse
mar
mart
martyrs
materials
france
france
said but bricks can fall on you during an earthquake
we haven't had an earthquake
here for a long time
mr
ruiz
said
as he came into the kitchen
so why
worry
you don't have to worry but i believe people should
be prepared
france said
earthquakes have done
a lot of the damage in some parts of
california
will there ever be an earthquake near our
ranch maria asked
we don't know for sure france said
our studies
show
that there
has been some
minor
minor s
seismic
activity
near here
what's s
s
s seismic
seismic
activity maria asked
during most earthquakes
rock keep inside
the earth moves and breaks apart
when the
broken rock shakes it sends
out
v
vibrations that
move the earth
these vibrations are called
seismic
waves
it's like
dropping
a stone in a pool
of water
maria nodded
the stone splashes and
waves go in a circle she said
right
france said
sometimes the earth
rolls up and down
in an earthquake is strong
enough it can cause buildings
to fall apart
but you
can make
some buildings almost
earthquake proof
how maria asked first you need to find a place to build
on that's
sold like that
hard
area
by the barn
there's
probably
chun
granite deep under the dirt
there
granite is a very hard rock
it usually stays
firm
in an earthquake
france picked up a
pencil
when you build
you should use wood and
put a
brace
here and
here
hey i have an
an idea mr dirt
ruth
looked over
france's shoulder
you can build the clubhouse
on
the square
of
<unk>
near the barn
we used
to
have a shed there
when
wood
rotted
it drove
drew
it down
that's great france said
the building can be
braced
the
con
cr
thanks dad
and thanks for your help
maria
france
maria said
i'm going to find my
friends tell them
we'll start building tomorrow
one of maria's friends brought s sturdy wood
to for the sides
of their building
another brought a piece of canvas
of the roof
by the end of the
week
the clubhouse
was
nearly
finished
good choice for the roof france said
one afternoon she checked on
their progress
canvas is like
t
light wood
lightweight so it won't hurt anyone
if there's an earthquake
the last job was to make a sign
maria had finished when
calico
callow
cal
calico <unk>
her
calico
her cat
streaked <unk> past
calico scampered
up a pile of
bricks
jumped onto the clubhouse and
disappeared over the
other side
maria shook
her head
calico had never act like this
then maria fe
felt the ground shake
she looked over toward the barn
raining
farm balls was raining by itself
maria couldn't believe what was happening
for a minute maria could not move her fa
move
her father walked over to her side
are you okay france ran toward them
we just had an earthquake
it wasn't very strong
but
a few dishes fell off
the shelf
she said
i
f
i'm ducked under the table so i'd be safe
i'm glad you two
were out in the open
nothing could fall on you
oh it was only a little rock
and roll mr ruiz
tried to smile
did you know
this earthquake was coming
unfortunately
no
france said
however
there were a few signs
like more
seismic
<unk>
seismic
activity
and today the chickens were acting strangely
calico to maria reminded
france nodded
animals may feel
moving deep in the earth
before we can feel it
but we can't depend
on them
we have to learn
what to do when an earthquake strikes
right maria said
with a smile
like building s
an earthquake proof
club
clubhouse
in the story it happened there was like a little earthquake and they didn't know it was coming and i think the little girl was learning about earthquakes
uhm the little girl was like
sil
the little girl was studying about earthquakes and
sil
then an earthquake came and she learned that like animals can feel it before they can
like making a clubhouse
okay
that monday ruth
ruth
leaned back in to the warm grass she could see a cloud dragon suddenly a
a door slammed
doc is home ruth said jumping to her feet
doctor bell lived next door doc liked to ride in balloons doc took
her big balloon in the park
to the park her friends always helped to fill the balloon with air
then to
then to heat the
air so the balloons would rise doc would climb into a large basket tied to the balloon
then the balloon would lift doc
doc high toward the clouds ruth
ruth found doc by her garage she heat she was looking at her big thermometer ruth knew that the
thermometer measures
the temperature of the air as the air warms the red liquid in the grass tube rises as the air cools the red liquid in the tube falls balloons are hard to fly said doc you need the right kind of weather
she looked at the sky let's see what the clouds tell us about the weather
ruth laughed
ruth laughed how can the clouds tell us anything doc pointed to a fluffy white clouds in the sky
those are cumulus clouds they tell us the fair weather is here
fair weather is balloon weather said doc ruth smiled they look like balls of cotton doc showed ruth pictures of the other kinds of cloud cirrus cirrus clouds high in the sky are thin white and curly they tell me that the weather might
might change it in about a day so cumulus clouds mean it's nice out and cirrus clouds mean
change said ruth
a third kind of cloud to look for is stratus the doc said doc
it it is a thick low cloud that covers the sky fog is stratus cloud near the ground what are clouds made of asked ruth clouds are made of tiny drops of water or bits of ice doc explained i have an idea she suddenly sh
see said suddenly you watch the clouds this week when the weather is right we'll go for a balloon ride
ruth
ruth asked parents ruth asked parents if she could
go
and they said yes she couldn't wait next morning ruth saw fog the sky was filled with thick low clouds
stratus clouds she said no no balloon ride today
on wednesday the sun was shining ruth dressed in a r in a rush and ran to find doc she opened the back door she saw mr hill's flag flapping in the wind
she thought about being
blown across the sky in a big balloon
i can see why
balloonists don't get up in the wind she thought
it wasn't wasn't balloon weather after all
early thursday morning ruth called doc there's no rain or wind the weather is just right there are only a few cumulus clouds in the sky you're right ruth said doc let's go
at the park ruth watched a big orange balloon fill with air
i it got bigger and bigger
the balloon looked like a big pumpkin to ruth it's a pump
is it a pumpkin balloon and she shouted doc helped her climb into the basket doc's friends
untied the ropes slowly the balloon rose
ruth's school i floated it floated above mr hill's flag
it was so nice to be up high but in less than an hour the wind began to blow we'd better land now said doc ruth didn't mind she'd had a great time soon the pumpkin balloon was back on the ground
thank you very much said ruth
sure doc replied i like having company
company would you like to go up again oh yes said ruth what a good day it had been
okay yes
wait where am i
now ruth would watch the sky every day
she could hardly wait for a clear blue sky
or some cumulus clouds without any wind then it would be time for another ride in the pumpkin balloon
uhm
sil
uhm one day the girl ruth i forget
sil
doc got home and on
sil
the girl said hi and
sil
then he said do you want to go on a ride with me in the balloon and so she did
sil
and then they went and then it started to get windy so they had to land and then he asked her if he wanted to go again so then she said yes

at the end of every school year
this year they got a
different problem they had to solve
the problem
to enter the next grade
she had been
wo
wondering
about the problem
i wondering about the problem all year
her problem all year today she would find out
oh yeah
maya opened her envelope
and read her problem
hmmm you must find three
forms of water
hint
use
what you know
about matter
about matter that doesn't make any sense
into her robot
computer
she find matter
the robot computer buzzed
and blinked
words appeared in the screen
matter
anything
that takes up
space
and has mass
what's a mass hmm that's weird
anything that oh
oh i've read that
well maya thought
i know
that where that water takes up the space
has mass
so
so water must be
so water must be matter
oh
maya heard her teacher ms
wong her voice came from the loudspeaker on the spaceship
get started student you only have
two hours to solve your problems
maya opened her
map of m
and looked
at it she cried c
the places
that she thought might have
water then she turned
on her jet
pack
she waved to the spaceship and flew off
as she flew
maya
thought about her problem
i must find
three forms of water
water wh water is matter
water is matter
can
matter have
more than one form
again maya spoke to her robot
from matter
robot's searched
s
<unk> flashed the answer matter can be
a soil
liquid and
g gas
water is matter maya thought
it must
have
three forms too i must find water as soil and liquid a gas
a i
know where
the
there is liquid water
she flew
to lake of the
tears
and landed on its shore she took
a jar from
her pack
and the robot filled
that's liquid water she said
now i need too
other forms maya now i need two other forms maya checked
the map
and flew toward the frozen mountains
maya arrived in the frozen mountains
and landed
at the bottom of
of in
ice cliff she shout off
her jet pack and spoke
to her robot
question
what is ice
the robot blink
blinked ice is a soil
soiled
solid
thing
solid
solid
where is that solid
oh
solid it is frozen water
flew off
hard
flew
hey this isn't so hard maya smiled ice
ice
is the second form
of water she picked
she picked up a rock
and broke it off
a piece of ice she dropped it in the
plastic bag
now i need to find third form of water
she thought what can it be she looked at the map again
both slimy swamp
and
steaming water
springs had looked
like good places to find water
streaming
uhm
streaming stepping
springs was closer
all go to the first maya decided
she turned to the jet pack
flew off
to the springs
time was running out
maya landed in in steaming springs
she spoke to her robot once again
question what is steam
the robot buzzed steam
is a gas it is water
in a gas from
steam
is the third form of water i've found it maya told the robot
to fill
f found
plastic
bag with steam the bag filled
like a balloon
maya sealed
the bag
the bag sealed the bag
and
back to the ship she cried
when maya got back to the ship
ms wong was outside waiting for her
her she smiled oh maya i was worried about you did you solve your problem yes ms wong
replied may it was easy really said the teacher asked yes maya said
i learned the matter has
has three forms soil
liquid
and gas water is matter
i found three forms of
water to solve my problem
maya opened
her pack pulled out the jar here
is the liquid water then she took out
the plastic bag here is the liquid gas maya
was shocked
a
the plastic
bag didn't look like a balloon anymore
it held only a few drops of water
what about the third form ms
asked ms wong maya didn't know what to say
the other plastic bag had held liquid water too
what happened she cried i really didn't find three different forms of water now i have only one
ms wong laughed it's ok maya you've learned something else about matter when you
heat
or cool matter
it can change from
heat melted
liquid s
you mean
i passed
asked maya in surprise yes you did
answered ms wong
maya ran
<unk>
happily into the spaceship
she was one
wondering
wondering what's that word wondering
yeah that's wondering
what the next
next year's problem would be
maya and the robot were the main characters and uhm they well maya had to find three things to pass this test
sil
to advance to the next grade and she found all three things but they all melted so they turned into water and uhm she found out she'd past because they melt usually cause they are going into a hot place so they melt

to is square to keep the pole from from twisting
while a i use it
why is one loop bigger than the other asked judy
ann because alligators because other different sizes answered
dr thomas
frogs
fish
i'll the alligators can run for only a short distance
but they can run fast so why don't you stand a little father away if you want
to watch can
continued
dr thomas once he he walked down toward the animal
what do alligators eat bryan asked well dr thomas answered for grown
alligators may eat just about anything but usually they
eat fish frogs
turtles and snakes
but
now
said bryan usually dr thomas explained when an
alligator wants to keep
it
waits quietly in the water until something comes by then the alligator snaps up its meal
a
to to a it
down its throat
a closed
to close down
on its prey but once
the jaws

on the alligator
he quickly pulled a big black rubber
band
from his pocket and placed
grew
bryan grew too tired
to struggle
dr thomas had captured the of

dear mom and dad parents
since you have grounded me and
told
told me to write down
why i am sorry before i was allowed
out of my room i am mad at you
i would like to start by saying that i think
you are very mean
to making me do this because it wasn't my fault
i couldn't help it anyway
it was an a accident and i didn't even do it on purpose i really didn't mean to s shave the cat really i swear
ok here is what happened as i remember it
i saw the cat was trying to get
the gerbils
and you told us we couldn't hit the animals
so we didn't
know what else to do so i grabbed dad's
noise hair clippers and shaved it
you could
you should be proud for
thinking so fast on
my toes
oh sure thinking
oh sure it's easy to say that i shouldn't have just picked the cat
up but sometimes we don't always think
all that great under pressure and
and you know what those stupid
gerbils didn't even
thank me they just ran
on that stupid wheel
and
did stupid things that's why the last time i shave the cat to protect any stupid gerbils
besides the real reason i shaved the cat was to keep it nice and cool
i just wanted to
see the cat getting all hot and uncomfortable and stuff
you guys will just probably say it's winter danny cats don't
overheat in the winter
but so what
if it's winter i mean it'll be summer soon enough
and i'll just
and i just wanted to
to the cat to get the cat
used to the idea before it got really hot
plus oscar my turtle told me to shave the cat
fine oscar can't really talk but if he could he would said please shave the cat it cat it keeps hitting me on the shell and trying to roll me over
when you leave the room you guys never liked oscar as much as the cat anyway
you wouldn't always take the cat's
side if you knew the stuff
did to me poor turtle
cat's aren't always nice just like my sister jenny isn't always nice
b
realest reason i shaved the cat was
to make
a wig for those poor hair l hairless cats
that we saw on t v
on the animal channel
i knew our cat
would grow fur back but some cats don't
have hair they called hairless cats
need fur in the winter sometimes i think
i swear that's the reason
i was going to sell the cat fur
buy
my sister jenny
braces for her big stupid face
plus i forgot to tell you
should be blame that you should be blaming
mrs
casper my science teacher
she made us save shave something for science ask her
she said that we
when we shave it hair it grows back
harder
and sometimes even darker so i thought if we could shave
a cat
a bunch of times hair would grow back
harder each time and soon have an incredible coat
of cat fur armor
then she would be super cat and you could take her
on t v shows
and get lots of money so that you can send jenny to college even if sh she has
is a dumb little tattle tale
she's good at school and you bought
her a cat cause she's responsible and stuff
just cause she's a good student didn't mean she's really responsible
last night i saw
that she didn't brush her teeth oh yeah i forgot to tell you
that
dear mom and dad jenny didn't brush her teeth last night
i think that should be brush her teeth twice tonight
that's just my opinion
though i'll opinion though
i'll let
i'll bet you didn't know something else
did you know that i wanted to be a barber i was afraid to tell you a a reason i shaved the cat was i wanted to be a barber and i needed to practice i was afraid if you wouldn't practice
on m
my own head i can practice by shaving jenny's head
promise that i'll do a better job then i did the cat cause i know
cause know i have
what dad calls life experience not what
that i shaved the cat though
actually the truth is that i by accident turned the noise hair clippers and the cat was being chased by the turtle
and ran right
by the clippers and shaved herself i kept saying no kitty no don't shave yourself
but my stupid sister never taught her cat
how to listen she just got ignored she just ignored me
see she's not so responsible after all
if i had a cat i would teach it
to to not shave itself
that's for sure i don't
have to get good grades
to know that you should teach a cat to shave itself
plus if you weren't always
cuddling with my sister so much maybe
you would have been with her cat instead
that cat came into my room because jenny never plays with it enough
the cat liked being shaved anyway
so don't see the big deal i think it really liked its haircut
the only reason it hasn't come out for two weeks is because you guys made such a big deal about it poor kitty
this
and poor kitty that is your fault really
dad please don't read the next part
dear mom a dear mom don't let dad know that i the real reason i shaved the cat was he always
it
he's always sneezing around it
n i know how much you hate him always sneezing and stuff so i thought if i get rid of this f
his fur he won't sneeze and you wouldn't have
of
bitter marriage so it's really m
my father's day to gi
father's day gift to him
i couldn't buy him anything nice since you took
away all my allowance when i shaved the neighbor's dog
how come
a cats get
a cat and i get stupid turtle anyway turtles don't do anything except poke their heads out
and not be cuddle
cuddly
i can get can i get a dog please
t c
<unk> i'm getting hungry and i'm sorry for shaving the cat
although you can see it's really jenny's fault for being as responsible as
you always s s say and not brushing her teeth
p s if you have
if you'd have bought her a turtle i couldn't
have shaved it
sincerely
danny
uhm it sounds like danny got grounded because he was shaving a cat and when he shaved the cat he wrote he had to write a note to his parents and he kept on saying it's jenny's fault no it's uhm your fault no it's the cat's fault no and he just kept on telling it so that it was another persons fault and it wasn't his so he wouldn't be grounded

a taffy
where are you cried scott
scott knew that taffy looked
to
liked to dig in the dirt
i know where taffy is he thought he is digging
where they are building the new road scott raced
past the dump trucks
he saw s
taffy
she do i just click on it
if i need help or something
l
the mole
the
ducked into a hole
taffy bro
bark
and began to dig dirt flew everywhere taffy said scott
where lost in a cloud of dust
when the dust
the mole
was gone then scott saw a bone
look taffy you found a bone scott cried
but taffy didn't care
he didn't even mind when
mind when scott took a bone scott had
a feeling that there was something special about this bone
s
scott went home
he washed the bone and showed it to his parents
this is a special bone
it is very
heavy said fa
said his father
i think it is a fossil
it is a bone that has been under the
under ground for millions of years
and h
his
his mother said why don't you take the fossil on your trip to the science museum you can show it to
it to a
what's a paleontologist asked scott
paleontologist are scientists who study fossils they work to understand what life on earth
was like millions of years ago
maybe my fossil is a bone from a real dinosaur scott thought
that night scott dreamed of huge dinosaurs two days later scott
carried the fossil to the museum
dr larue
was a
paleontologist
was waiting for the class she led them into the room
filled with
skeletons of dinosaurs
dr was carefully opened scott's paper bag
she took out the fossil she looked surprised
and excited
where did you find this she asked scott answered my dog taffy
dug it up near the
new road dr was
told the children that this fossil was
a dinosaur toe bone
she asked them to help her find out which dinosaur it came from
they all wanted to help very much look at each dinosaur try to match the toe bone she said
scott looked at the
at the feet of
the huge
how about the t rex it
has huge teeth
uhm
pointy toe bones said scott's friend julie no this toe bone is square answered scott
the children
looked at the dinosaurs one by one
then scott noticed the skeleton of a
saur
l he looked at the toe bones
then
what did it look like
how tall was it
what did it eat was it friendly he asked
wait wait ask
ask one question at a time said dr las
first
the
was flat like a duckbills
are also called duckbills or duckbill dinosaurs second the toe bone
you found is large it came from an adult
this dinosaur was over ten meters long
or about as long as a bus
finally duck bill
dinosaurs lived in herds and ate plants like cows and do now
imagine a whole herd of dinosaurs as big
as a bus scott gasped
come over here and i'll
show you another kind of fossil said dr lewis
dr lewis showed them a giant footprint in a rock
this was made by a large dinosaur called
<unk> something like that
that's really big said scott he thought about the tricks
taffy made in the mud
was much bigger than
a dog's
dr lewis was smiled suddenly scott looked worried
dr lewis are there
more
bones or any tricks by the new
road
well the dump trucks
discover them
no said dr lewis
they will wait for us
to look for more fossils then they will finish the road
we may find the rest of your duckbill
you children can watch
and scott
you must bring taffy along
he may be the best dinosaur hunter of all
should i press end
scott he uhm was looking for taffy and while he was looking for her uhm he found a dinosaur b bone but it was a toe and he was uhm going to the museum so he brought it and showed doctor loss
sil
uhm
sil
he uhm acted like he liked the his dinosaur bone uhm
sil
taffy was chasing a mole and uhm his dog dug into the dirt and then he found the bone
sil
and then they went home and found he went home and showed his parents the bone and they said uhm that it was a it may have been a fossil and it was
sil
and so his parents told him to bring it to the uhm museum so he could show doctor loss
sil
and he looked like he really was interested in the uhm bone

when his when his owners <unk> it doesn't understand me
when his owners found him
as a puppy he was very dirty so h
his owners name
him
fleabag
he soon learned that
whenever his
owner said fleabag come
come he would sometimes get a yummy treat
that was a long time to go when flag bag
fleabag was a puppy he was older
old
older now and t
had problems with his back legs that made him
limp when he ran
but that didn't stop him from running
like most dogs he loved to run
there was a dog
park near where he lived he enjoyed playing with
the other dogs because he didn't have
to be on his leash at the dog park
snot
that would
always come
up to fleabag and bite his neck leg and run away saying
bark bark bark
bark
which in dogs
which in a
which in dog talk means
you are too slow to catch me with your limp
s
o i'm going
to pick on you
fleabag would always chase snot but
would never catch him
one day fleabag went to a vet fleabag didn't mind the vet because usually the people
in the white coats gave him treats
fleabag was
at
the vet to have surgery on his legs
when he awoke up from the surgery he didn't remember
where he was but he sure did want to see his owners
soon they
came and picked him up and drove him home
fleabag suddenly
realized that his legs itched very
badly
he thought
oh boy i'm going to lick my leg so
hard that
the
itching is going to
go away
so h
he turned his head around to lick his leg but there was a big white thing on his way
he was wearing a collar that made it
possible to lick his legs
then
the next day he
was walking with his owners on the leash and they went to the dog park
his owners wouldn't let fleabag play without
the leash since he still needed to heal
but it was nice to see all his friends mean old snot said bark bark bark
which mean
dogs
dog
which mean in dog talk
why do you have to wear that stupid looking collar
boy do you look silly in that ugly collar ha ha ha
eventually fleabag got to take the collar off but
by then the
legs didn't
itch so he didn't
want to lick them
for six weeks he could take walks and go to the dog park but he couldn't be let off his leash
which made him a little mad
at his owners
one day he took a walk to the dog park and all his friends were there
as usual
very carefully
his owners reached around fleabag and took
his leash off
fleabag
didn't know what to do because he had been on his leash so long
just then snot bit him on the back leg and ran away
realize
which
meant he was allowed to run
so fleabag started running after snot
snot was laughing because he knew fleabag could
never catch him but suddenly he noticed that fleabag was catching up to him and before he knew it
fleabag ran
into him and knocked him down and said bark bark bark which in dog
talk means don't you ever mess with me again snot
fleabag was able to run faster than he could ever remember
he was so
happy that he could run
fast that
he sprinted to his owners and gave
them a big kiss
ex in it
sil
and some other dogs
sil
and he couldn't run that fast because
sil
snot
sil
bit him on the legs and on the neck
sil
so
sil
they took his owners took him to the vet
sil
and
<br>
he
<br>
when he woke up he didn't notice
sil
where he was but he was
sil
he wanted to see his owners
sil
and then they picked him
sil
picked him up
sil
and
sil
the next day he went to the
sil
park and he had
sil
snot said he had a funny collar on
sil
and the next day
sil
he went with his owners to the dog park
sil
and they took his collar off
sil
and
<br>
all the dogs were there
sil
like usual
<br>
and snot bit him on the legs
sil
and said bark bark bark and then he ran away and then snot no i mean

the land didn't seem as beautiful now

seventeen sixty five
pete and his father had s
had set
the broken
bone
in place but
healing would take a long time
pete
and his father had been hunting for
plants
pete's father was
a
f
botanist
botanist or plant expert
the
cherokee cherokee called him
flower hunter
pete
wanted to be flower hunter too
son i want you to look
carefully at
the every flower pete's father had said
on an early tr
trip
some plants don't have flowers pete had answered
you're right his father had said
that
for
three doesn't have flowers
it's
a
conifer
or cone
bearing plant
it has hard brown cones
like pine
cones said pete
yes do you know what the these cones have
inside them asked his father
pete
opened
a cone
seeds he said
father do all plants have seeds
most plants do
they are
dive
dived into
two groups divided into two groups
one
is flowering plants
the other is
cone
bearing plants
flowering plants have seeds inside fruits
and cone bearing plants
have seeds in cones
on
the last
hunting trip pete had discovered
the two kinds of flowering plants
<unk> have flowers with groups of three
petals
petals
di
dicots dis cots
di
dicots have flowers with groups
four five
petals
it
was fun looking at all those plants
pete heard heard
his father
call
this was no time for
gazing into
campfires
peter
come here please
i think my leg is
infected i have
a bad fever his father said in a
tired voice you must help me son
some plants can help
can help me get well
bring me
willow bark
and pine sap
for my leg
club moss too
if you can please hurry
pete
was afraid
could
could he find
the right plants
he would have
to try
he
hurried off into the woods
it
was easy to find
the willow bark
willows with
long skinny leaves
were growing by the river
pete
liked
their sharp smell he
stripped off some bark
and put it in his pouch
fending fending pine sap
was easy too
pine trees
stood all around him
he saw
their
prickly cones and smiled
their green needles
pete picked
lumps of sap from the bark
tiny club moss plants grew under the
pines they looked like
toy trees pete remembered that
club moss is a
it has s
spores
instead
of seeds
he
shook the plants over a small jar
soon
the jar was full of spores
now pete started to hunt for
the
he
searched everywhere
he was getting
hungry
his feet
hurt s
scratches
over his arms finally he found
a few plants that looked
right
but
but how could he be sure
he thought back to his lessons
about plants
stems
pete's father had told him
that
a good b bone
botanist
carefully checks the plants fruit
leaves stems and roots
to find each kind of plant
his father always remembered
pete that there was a lot
to
a lot to know about plants
thinking again of the lessons his
father had given him
pete
felt
sad
would his father
be all right
pete knew he must find the right plant
his father's life
depended on
what he had learned
he
examined
the right plant
he thought
it had a the right
kind of small white flowers
the leaves were a
opp opposite
opposite
opposite
each other on the stems too
uhm
each leaf had
<unk> right across from it
for one
last test pete
dug
up the plant
and looked at the root
the root was fat and bumpy
exactly right
as pete
left the clearing
he saw
a bush with
something white on it
he went closer
the bush
the bush had shiny green leaves
some leaves were were
turning red
it had large white flowers
pete
had
never seen anything so pretty
father will like
this
he thought he
knew better than to touch a strange plant but he
s
too did
s
s
studied it closely then
he
returned to camp
pete showed
his father the plants he had found
he told him about the strange plant with
the white flowers too
yes these are the right plants son
said his father smiled but where did you find the that plant with
the white flowers
i'll show you when
you you are feeling better said pete good said his father
pete
boiled
some water in a cup
he put
the
the willow bark
and
the son said in the water to make tea
after letting it sit
for a while pete's father drank the tea
pete put the pine sap
in
cl close club
moss spores on his father's leg
then pete's
father
slept for hours when
he woke
awoke
pete's father felt much better
the willow bark
was
had made his fever go away
the club moss spores and the pine sap
were helping his
infection infected leg heal
peter can you help me make a
crutch asked his father
then
i want to
i want you to take me to see that plant with the white flowers
it's
in this clearing
by the river pete explained
they hiked
to the clearing pete's father
studied the plant
you've made an
exciting discovery he said
we'll take
some
cuttings from this plant
and you can name it
i think
we should name it for your friend ben
franklin
he likes
s
science science
you'll like
to have a plant named for him that's a fine idea his father added looking at
him proudly
and pete you're going to be a great flower hunter
and got a fever so he had to go back and get all these different types of flowers to heal his fever and make him feel better
sil
and pete found these discovery of these white flowers they named them after ben franklin
sil
because he likes science
sil
and he he might like a plant named after him

son he would
be happy to buy you a new hat but
we need to new
something first
the fa
<unk>
justin began smart know what his father needed to know
save
your brother
dad
i think n know
what you going to say
i promise that if
we find the
perfect hat
that i'll wear
it
everyday
so justin
and his mother
shopped for his
found the perfect one
and found the perfect one
but from then on justin
would never take it off
and all his
m could do was roll his eyes mom could do
is roll her eyes
well he got a hat and he never wore it and then on his birthday it was too small for him so he asked his mom and dad instead of giving me gifts will you give me a new perfect hat
when his owners got h
him when his owners got him
as a puppy all he wanted his to do was run and run
and was run and run so
his owners named him racer
when th
then when he got older he
he developed problems with his back legs every time
he ran he would limp
because
he like most dog most dogs racer loved to run
when
there was a dog in the park near where he lived
he enjoyed playing at the dog park because he didn't have to be on his leash when he was there so he could run as much as he liked there was one dog at the park named fang
he would always come up to racer and bite his back leg and run away so
saying bark bark bark bark which in dog means y you are too slow to catch me with a limp of yours so i'm going to pick on you racer would always chase fang but he could never catch him one day racer went to the vet racer liked
the vet because
the people in
white
costumes gave him treats racer didn't know it but
he was at the vet to have surgery to fix his legs
when he woke up from the surgery he didn't even remember where he was but soon his owners came and drove him home
on the drive home racer realized that his leg was very was itchy was itched very badly he thought
oh boy i'm going to lick my leg so hard that i
that the itching is go
going to go away
so would
so so he turned to his head around to lick his legs but there was a
white thing
in his way
he was wearing a collar that made
it
impossible to click to lick his legs
f
fo
fo few
days later
he went to his owner the dog he went with his owners to the dog park
racer had been on a leash since he
since he still needed to heal from surgery
but it was nice to see all his friends
mean uhm mean old fang said bark bark bark bark which meant why do you have to wear that stupid looking collar
sure it sure does look silly
eventually racer didn't have to wear the collar but then his legs didn't itch
so he didn't want to lick them for six weeks racer would take walks and go to the dog park but he still had to be on a leash one day he took a walk through the dog park and with
and his friends were there as usual then his owners re
reached out around his neck and took off his leash just then
fang bit him on the back leg and ran away racer's owners said go
run s so racer started running and chasing fang
fang was laugh laughing because he knew racer could never catch him but suddenly he noticed that racer was catching up to him racer was running faster than he could ever remember before he knew it he had caught
up with fang and knocked him down racer said bark bark bark which in
dog talk means don't pick on me any more fang
and from that
day on fang never bit racer's leg racer was so happy that that he could
d run fast
and ran and ran in circles finally he ran back to his owners
and gave them a big kisses
his f and g gave them big kisses for fixing his legs
parents
told her that her
imagination was overactive
there next to and that someday
her wild stories would get her into trouble this
this time however christi was sure that
there was something and very mysterious going on spring vacation to and was always very exciting but this one was more exciting than usual
christi now was going on airplane for first time she was going to houston texas to visit her aunt
and cousins her good
her
parents had been so busy
kissing and hugging her good bye that they hadn't noticed the very mysterious man who had boarded
the plane
and that sitting right next to her
christine christy had never met anyone in los angeles who wore two watches
and she could think of a good reason why anyone would
then there was very a very mysterious box he was carrying on this on this side on a big read letters it said nasa also he kept scrub
bling scribbling things on a note pad christina had try tried without success to see what the man was writing
after lunch the man pushed his seat back and took a nap christina took his chance to glance at the pad it read return the moon by return the moon by tuesday
now christina was sure she was into something strange
return the moon
when a mysterious man left his seat christine noticed he had dropped a photograph she looked at it and saw that the man had already left christina put the photograph in her pocket u
u u and aunt grace was waiting for her christina at the gate christina ran and hugged her on the drive home christina told aunt grace about the flight and the mysterious man who sat next to her on the plane
gloves fingers held tweezers were lift
can you explain this she asked what d do you think return the moon by tuesday means i don't know mark answered but this photograph looks very familiar i know it was in a book my sister has known that
terry is training to be an astronaut i'm sure i saw it it on in one of her books well
aunt grace said mark christy terry
i is it the n a s a johnson space center she works near the lu lu lunar sample exhibit
we can visit the her this afternoon maybe she can help you find
maybe she can help you find the answer to the mystery they found terry r right away first she showed
them a large photograph uh of the first man on the moon nearby the glass case was a footprint pressed into the lunar soul
soil by an astronauts boot it looked li like a the prints of a big tennis shoe the soil looked like dirty sand altogether there were six apollo missions or trips to the moon between nineteen sixty nine and nineteen seventy two terry said
for each mission space craft carried three astronauts one once in the moon orbit
one astronaut stayed on the command model well the two other astronauts explored the surface and collected moon rocks what is so special about moon rocks asked mark
well said terry for one thing rocks very old about the same age as the oldest rock in earth
but studying moon rocks has comparing them to earth rock s scientist l learn
scientist learn about how the moon formed and and changed over billions of years
when they reached the second floor christy and mark were amazed they were looking at a glass case with two holes in each
hole was emptying black rubber gloves
like one of the photographs and they signed on a wall nearby scientists use this case of gloves to examine rocks
so much for your mystery said mark that's part of it were clearing up the man on the plane had something to do with n a s a and probably worked with the moon samples but i still
don't understand why anyone would want to wear two watches or how someone could return the moon it was time to go aunt grace terry and mark and christy were in the parking lot when christina saw a familiar face
i work for the n a s a carrying moon samples and i from labs around the world i was very upset when i found i'd lost the picture is there anything i can do to thank you for returning it he said
i always wear two watches it tells me what time it is in the yoke tokyo and where my f where my family lives and in the other watch tells me what time it is it is where i am
you wouldn't want me to call my family in the middle of
the

laurie spread the texas map out on the dining room table she looked at the green patch on
the left
left and read the words
big bend national park
her mother looked over her shoulder she pointed to a place called
<unk>
this is where
we'll put our rafts in the water she said she moved her hand down the
<unk>
grande river then she stopped and
this is
rock slide what is rock slide asked <unk>
it's a prize of
the trip mom
answered with a smile she's got to
pack for clothes and pick up
some fresh fruit from uncle don
uncle don was
laurel's favorite uncle the year he promised to take them on one of the river trips in
his little aunt don said we must careful measure the height of everything we bring we don't want to
we don't want the drafts to be too heavy he wants to fill our big cooler with fruit and ice we'll
measure everything
in sounds because
that's how we'll buy the fruit
he said the f the filled cooler can't weight more than twenty seven pounds our cooler weighs thirty pounds we can fill three two liter of plastic puddles of water and freeze them each one will weigh four pounds that means we can bring three pounds of fruit and laurie ac accidently said mom now let's estimate the weight of some fruit and make
a shopping list on the way to the store laurie wrote the list fourteen apples fourteen oranges twenty bananas two melons two pineapples and two
branches of grapes at the store laurie and her mom carefully weighted the fruit on the list
it weighed thirty four pounds that is the pretty good estimate mom said yes but i'd better take off some fruit
the next day everyone at at the <unk> quickly they inflate the rafts and put them in the water
laurie watched uncle don
what is the jugs asked laurie <unk> uncle don answered in summer people need lots of water each day laurie was surprised uncle don had measured everything carefully before the trip she was glad that they had been so careful with the fruit
pull out rows through the water when she looked into the river how deep is the rio grande she asked
let's find out by estimating said uncle don he pushed a an oar into the water until it hit the bottom then he pulled out
it out com compare the wet part of the oak with the ice chest the ice chest is about eighty centimeters long wow the wet part is about twice as long as long that's only one and a half meters uncle don looked worried the river is low
it's going to be a rough trip through rock slide what's a rock slide laurie laurie was puzzled
don uncle don smiled just wait you'll find out soon that night the camp they camped on the river bank
under the stairs in the morning the river looked even lower eat up laughed uncle john the more you eat the lighter the raft will be when
get
we get to rock slide laurie wondered the rock slide could be as they paddled small rafts rapids riddled in the distance why do rapids look different than the rest of the river ask laurie look at the water uncle don explained what
is different about the water in the rapids
laurie started at the riddles it's shallow she said i can see little rocks on the bottom right now watch that leaf float through the
rapids said uncle don the water is too
is fast too laurie added you
your right again
are
we going to ride any big
rides it's asked laurie
no
until rock slide uncle don smiled early in the afternoon uncle don is
decided to stop and camp why are we shopping now
laurie asked listen whispered uncle don above the splashing laurie could hear a faint r roar
that's rock slide uncle don said mysteriously
we'll need a
need plenty of daylight when we reach it
i'll also have to s repack the rafts very carefully laurie listened to the roar she wondered how a rock slide
could make such a sound it
took a long time for
her to fall
asleep that night next morning everyone got on the rafts laurie you a ride with your
mother today said uncle don laurie looked at the rafts the food chests of water jugs were almost empty the rafts seemed much higher
in the water uncle don is making his raft lighter she thought i bet it's shallow
at rock slide at
as they turned the next bend of the river laurie saw another rafts sinking on the bank the river had disappeared into
the mountain of rocks
she had no sinking through rock slide
uncle don climbed the rocks over looking rock slide everyone followed laurie as down into the canyon there the lazy rio
grande turned into fast
<unk> rapids uncle don told everyone how to travel through the rapids stay close
in the sides of the cliffs he said laurel looked
laurie looked at the water
it's was darker
clear the cliff sides it must be deeper there she thought
soon laurie hugged in the
middle of a spending raft all around her water a
roared
as he crashed over rocks paddles
pulled through the water rafts bounced off the canyon walls water poured sh in what wh
when laurie's boat leaned against the rocks she gasped as
the rafts turned and and tossed
as last the
raft reached the canyon floor floor i tried happy group the paddles
rested on and nearby tired beach inside in
side
santa el canyon then had served rock slide but laurie had learned something too she learned as that a safe trip
has nothing to do with luck you must carefully plan and measure your load of
load if you want
to master the rio grande as at rock slide
uhm
sil
she goes to the store and then she's uhm going
sil
to a rock slide i and then she passes like a canyon and then there they are

uhm

i don't really know

my favorite colors are red blue and purple i have lots of friends their names are lizzy tori mckenna and mandy my favorite place is the swimming pool i like to go to my friend's house or the swimming pool on saturdays and sundays
rooster john before i tell you about rooster john
got his name i should tell
you should know a little about
franksville was a town that seemed to have one problem after the other
their problems started out when they ran out of water
thankfully someone was digging a hole and found water
soon after that started to get the flies they got tons and tons of flies
then the flies stopped
but just then a man moved into town who played the flute so badly that people would run stopped run away screaming this maybe
a poorly
played flute doesn't sound all that bad but just try to imagine someone scratching a chalkboard with a fork
flute sounded when this guy played it i'm serious still it's not as bad as millions of flies i suppose
<unk> the bad flute
player was rooster john he wasn't called rooster john yet
that came later
he was the
was the new town dentist
he was an excellent dentist but his real love was music
he played many musical instruments such as guitar the tuba the piano and the clarinet
however for some reason
the way his mouth was
was shaped made his flute sound awful we can't he we can't let you play the flute anymore john
said the police chief s said police chief sanders the neighbors are complaining and the cats and dogs are trying to chew off their ears
but i have to play i was born to do it i don't know why but i feel like
i have to
t
to or el or else bad things will happen look john i've
heard you play the clarinet you're quite good why don't you play that instead
said chief sanders
oh
oh that's a nice instrument but
it's just not the flute i even wrote you a song chief sanders it's called cops and robbers then he played the song
the police chief hated the so
sound so much that he threw john in jail
they couldn't keep john in jail since was were breaking any laws
so of
so there was noth so there was nothing
the police could do besides everybody loved john since he had become
the town dentist everybody's teeth were much whiter and cleaner and no one had any cavities so the there w was a problem in
in the little town of of frankville of of franksville
what
what should they do the
they couldn't keep john in jail and they
didn't want to kick out of out of town
because they all had such
nice teeth so they so they
decided that john could play the flute and everybody else would have to wear earplugs well i'm sure you guessed that
that didn't work
no one could hear anything people were getting into car accidents and everybody
looked really silly at the dances dancing to music they couldn't hear they just couldn't lead a normal life
so they decided to lower him down a well
and let him play down where no one could hear him
john thought that was an ok idea but
but an echo in the well the flute sound louder
windows were breaking
and all the cows in town started to make sour milk
the local dentist dr
wong came up with an idea
he thought if that he made a new mouthpiece
es especially shaped for john's mouth <unk>
play the flute normally
and guess what it worked
dr wong was the town hero the flute sounded normal and it turned
out john could play it quite well
the
the people in
town decided to have a great big parade in franksville
to celebrate the fact for once there there was no water problem no fly problem and no flute problem
dr wong and john were the stars of the parade
they were the were up on the main float a big band played as they marched up and down main street
everyone cheered
then suddenly
a fly landed on a little girl then a fly landed on someone else then some landed on a bunch of people pretty soon tons of flies tons of flies
were landing on everyone
before they knew it the town was filled with flies
oh no cry cry chief sanders just when things were were going good for
franksville
john no
what to do so he just kept on pieces
flute the flies were annoying flies would swat his flute
up
at them with his hand or even his new flute
he started shaking the flute to get the flies off and accidentally smashed pieces
but it was very upset at first then he said oh well good thing i brought my old flute as back up
no no please don't play your old flute begged dr
wong but it was too late john had started playing swat at the townsfolk
then he said
when the townsfolk heard the noise they couldn't even swat
flies anymore they had to cover their ears from the horrible sound
the flies would land all over
the people as
it into
they couldn't swat them off it was gross then suddenly the flies
flew away fast as they could
dr wong thought for a second then pronounced
it's the flute sound the flies hate john's flute playing as much as we do
john the dentist is driving the flies away
and it was then that the people of franksville real realized that they would have to
it to take
the good with the bad because as bad as the flute sounded it was a lot bad better
than thousands of flies crawling on them
from then on john would wake up at sunrise
like a rooster and play to keep the flies away
it was well sort of well it was town called franksville
well in this town called franksville there were a lot of problems happening and one of the ones was flies and another was was a bad flute playing
sil
for sometime on there there were s after the flies had gone away there were s some solutions that didn't quite work about about the flute playing even though they told him to stop playing the flute he wouldn't
and eventually a t a person a dentist named doctor wong found out a way a way to m make the flute s s sound
sil
nice
<br>
a special like cast that went over the flute players mouth and made the flute sound better
sil
and it worked
there was a big parade and it and it started out pretty good but then some flies started landing on people and then tons and tons of flies started started to come
sil
and then when after after a little while the the new flute john had got broke so he had to use his old one and it sounded bad even with the cast
sil
so
sil
what happened is is that all the townsfolk didn't like it and
<br>
like the flute playing or the flies but then the flies started going away it was it was almost it the the townspeople found out that the flies hated it as much as they did
it was it was more overly a half miracle
a long low sound awakened newt from his dreams
all newt could
we're hear were leaves slapping
on the beach
then the lonely sound returned honk
honk newt ran to the open window
he couldn't see the lights in town
he couldn't see the moon
the night air felt cold and damp
damp
from
the next room aunt
i don't know the last name
howey
spoke it's
only the
fog
foghorn
newt newt
wo were
in
he
crawled back to bed
and soon dreamed again
newt woke to
a hazy world
he watched water drip
from the
porch roof
as he ate
muffins he the fog was beginning to clear
the foghorn
honked again
why do they need
a horn
t
to tell us it's foggy
he asked
we can see the fog
aunt helen laughed the foghorn doesn't
sound
to tell us it's foggy
it sounds to warn
sailors about rocks and
land
land
it's
like the like
it's like
a lighthouse for the
ears
neat newt said newt had arrived yesterday to spend a week of his summer vacation with aunt helen
she had promised to take him sailing on her boat
this fog won't last long she said
the temperature dropped at
last night
the water vapor
vapor in the air
caught
conned
<unk>
into water
droplets
that makes
up the fog
soon
sunlight will warm the air
that will turn the fog into
vapor again
then we can go sailing
by ten thirty the fog had cleared
newt and aunt helen put
on life jackets
they carried
their
hen
he sun
lunch and oars
down the sandy path to the dock
aunt
a rowboat
drifted from a rope tie
tied to the dock they climbed in
in aunt helen
rowed
to the sailboat
they planned to sail and
to an island
and spend the
day exploring
it
it
it
aunt helen
owned a small sailboat
it had
a tiny cabin
cabin
did you ever want motor boat newt asked
aunt helen smiled smiled no she said
why not asked newt
if the w
wind stops
then you can go anywhere
m
motors
are noisy
repelled
aunt helen i
like
the peace and quiet of sailing
sometimes their
their is no wind but i know that
soon the wind will blow again
newt helped raise the sail
on the
mast
a pole
rising from the center of the boat
the sail
remained

newt
of a sheet hanging on a
clothesline
but
the sail was tied to
tied
at its
corners
instead of letting the breeze
slip under its
it
the way a sheet did
the sail caught
the breeze cast off
the
mooring line
aunt helen said
newt
until the rope
that held the boat
he
could feel the
boat again to move
i'm going to teach you to steer
aunt helen
said
aunt helen said
this is
this is
the tiller
he you use it to steer the boat
she pushed the tiller toward the left side
of the boat
the front of the boat moved
to the
right
when newt moved the tiller toward the right the boat turned left
aunt helen moved the sail to catch more
wind you
you sail by knowing the direction of
the wind she said
right
of the
right now the winds are coming from
the ocean
how do you know asked
asked
newt asked
one of
one way is to look
at the f flag
on the town
dock aunt helen explained
that
if you're far from land
you can
can't can't see
the flag
newt
flag newt asked
i tie a piece of red yarn to the
top of
top of the mast
aunt helen pointed up
she
see it
it's called a
tow
telltale
this is the m
morning breeze blowing in
from the ocean
in
the
evening the wind blows out from the land
why doesn't
the wind always go the same way
in the daytime the ocean is
cooler than the
land s so the air above the water is cooler than the air above the land do you know what cool air does
to warm air
asked aunt helen
it pushes it out of the way said newt
right
when the cool ocean air pushes the
warm air
warm land air out of the way
a breeze blows from the ocean to the land
and the
eve
evening
the opposite happens because the land cools off more quickly
wh then than the ocean does
when the cooler when the cooler land air
pushes the warm
warm ocean air out of the way we get
a breeze from the land to the ocean
two hours later the boat neared th the island
and
<unk>
i lost my spot
i was on the word where they just well i was near where they just got to the island
mmm hmm then aunt helen dropped the
anchor and they
wade to shore
after newt and aunt helen ate they explored the island
they returned to the beach late
late in the afternoon newt noticed that the air was still
there
where was no
wind at all
what happened to the wind asked
he asked
it just
it's just the afternoon
doldrums aunt helen said
the land
the land and the sea are just about the same
temperature so
the so
there's no wind but
how will we get home again
newt asked
what don't worry there's going to be a good wind
after six so o'clock
aunt helen replied
why don't
we collect some shells while we wait
at six thirty the wind picked up
aunt helen
decided to get back on the boat
on on
get back on the boat
as the
raised
the sail newt watched
it stamp
on the
in the sudden
the strong breeze
it's it's like magic
or what newt asked
it it's the changing temperature that we talked about the
mainland is being cool to cool
it's
cool
faster than the ocean
the cool land air pushes the warm
ocean air out of the way so now the wind is coming for the land
newt said
i want to learn how to sail
we can go go again tomorrow
aunt helen smiled
will tomorrow be a good day for sailing let's ask the sunset
what will that tell us sh he asked
the she said
red sky in the mornings

the spiders had grown big enough to take
air of
themselves
he also knew what he
had to do
he picked up
the aquarium and
carried
it outside
he removed
the screen from the top of the aquarium so the spider could live
goodbye little spiders he said

i don't mean t i don't mean
i don't mean the zoo in the city said sue we can make our own zoo in the yard all
all our friends can bring their pets what a great idea said billy we can
have balloons peanuts and lemonade it will be lots of fun
i'll call grandpa said sue he he w worked at the zoo he can help us make
our zoo ike like
look just like
the real z one the billy ran to the door i'll tell everyone to bring their pets here tomorrow
later that day grandpa came to help
the kids he brought tools wood and paint he also had some right r wire to make cages he found sue and billy in the yard they were deciding where to put the animals we can put sam's goldfish next to
ann's cat s said sue you're right billy agreed cats like to eat fish cats
and fish don't do not belong to
to each other you need a plan for your zoo said grandpa billy thought about this city zoo different kinds of animals were
in
different areas we need to put the animals in groups grandpa nodded he picked up the some
w wood he made five signs on each sign he painted one word when he was done he
his signs said birds mammals fish
and
amphibians reptiles
have feathers wings and beaks they also lay eggs said sue my parakeet
said nancy's
chicken can go in to the same group that's good thinking said grandpa what about mammals billy asked a cat is a mammal grandpa said so mammals have hair or fur said sue
and they don't lay eggs the babies grow in the mother's in the mother's body
said billy billy what that's what happened when our cat and kittens
our cat
fed her baby kittens
milk from her own body s and added sue dogs must be mammals too said billy and horses and lion grandpa's
grandpa smiled that's right
and so
and so are people
sue and billy were surprised to find
out they were mammals too
sign said fish sam's goldfish have scales they have t gills to breathe in water most most baby fish ca
come from eggs billy added ok said sue
but where do we put
d <unk> frog
when he f
first caught it it was a tadpole that lived in water
yeah billy exclaimed and now it can hop
on land or swim in a pond that kind of animal
is an amphibian grandpa said the babies
hatch from eggs in the water like fish
do
like fish do
when they get
older they can live on land so <unk> frog will get t grow next go near the sign that says amphibians said sue
calvin doesn't have a pet said billy he is going to draw a picture of his favorite animals the whale should
really a mammal sue nodded
i saw a movie about whales baby whales c
come from their mother's body
not from eggs and mother whales nurse's
nurse their babies and water they also breathe with lungs
like we do said grandpa but they don't have
hair or fur reptiles said
s read billy
a snake is a reptile so reptiles are animals with no fur wings or feathers said sue
or gills added grandpa
they breathe with lungs
and they've got dry skin laughed sue
and scales crocodiles turtles and lizards
lizards are some other reptiles said grandpa
reptiles can have short legs long
like turtles no legs like snakes most reptiles lay eggs like birds fish and amphibians do
i know who who will bring a reptile shouted sue ellen has a grass snake great said billy the three the three set to work making cages for the animals billy smiled at grandpa do you
know bill the best thing about
about our zoo grandpa shook his head no what billy at the end of the day all the animals get to go home
the end
uhm they it was the first day of summer vacation and they uhm didn't know what to do and so uhm it was either billy or sue uhm said let's go to the zoo and then some of them said let's not go to the zoo we can make our own zoo and so then they were uhm and so then they called up their grandpa and they called up their friends and their friends were bringing uhm
they uhm brought their animals and so they were making ca cage different cages for different animals cause uhm cause they thought that the cat and the uhm fish could go together but if the cat and the fish went together the uhm the cat would probably eat the fish
sil
but there's one problem if the cat tried to eat the fish <unk> cats hate water
uhm that uhm their grandpa bought some stuff like uhm like uhm uhm wire to make uhm a uhm cage for the animals and he made signs that said reptiles and uhm
sil
amphibians and uhm mammals and something else like that

uh
a glass full nuts was on the table albert who loved nuts saw it he climbed up on the table and put his hand into the jar he grabbed a whole handful
he tried to pull out his hand uh i mean his hand out
the mouth of the jar was too small for
for his fist
he pulled and pulled and became very angry at the jar but it w it was no use his hand was stuck
at last he began to scream and cry his mother ran into the room he saw what was wrong wrong with him was matter albert she asked
the this mean old jar

his mother
his mother laughed when she saw the cause of trouble you greedy boy

albert took
a and took only two

next time don't be so
greedy
you don't know what a brahmin brahmin is brahmin is
a brahmin is a very good and gentle kind man who lives in india
one day a brahmin was walking on a country road
that he came upon a tiger shut in a strong iron cage
the villagers had caught him and
and shut him and there for being wicked
oh brother brahmin brother brahmin said the tiger please let me out and get a little drink s
i am so thirsty
and there is no water here
but brahmin but brother tiger said brahmin you know what if you i let you out you would jump on me and eat me caught never brother brahmin said the tiger never in the world such
i would do such bad things
do just let me out for a minute and i'll get a little little drink of water
please brother brahmin
so brahmin unlocked the door and let the tiger out
the moment
was he was out he jumped on brahmin and about to eat him up
but brother tiger said brahmin you promised you would not
is
not fair for you to eat me when i set you free
it is perfectly right
i and i will you up said the tiger but brahmin argued
so hard at the at last the tiger to
agreed to wait
to wait
they would ask
the first five people they met
whatever it was fair for him to eat the brahmin
if he decided it was right the brahmin would let the tiger eat him the first thing
they came to to ask was out
an old brahmin tree
banyan tree
by the road a banyan tree is a kind of fruit tree brother banyan
said the brahmin said the bu
brahmin
if
said the brahmin
ear earlier
does it seem right that
right that this tiger could eat me i set
when i set from his ca set him from the cage
the brahmin tree looked
at
at them and spoke in a tired voice
in the summer he said
the sun
when the the sun is hot men come to sit
in the cool sh cool
of my shade and eat my fruit on my branches but when the evening comes
and they rest they break my twigs and scatter my leaves
and throw stones at my branches for more fruit men are
ungrateful let the tiger eat the brahmin
yeah i sort of agree with him
because of i mean i don't agree with him if someone's bad to them they should be nice to them anyway right
ok this
we've only asked one
we still ha we still have four to ask
they came to a place where a
old bull was laying in the road
the brahmin went to him and said brother bull oh brother bull it does seem a
to to fair thing that this tiger should eat me after i freed him from his cage
the bull looked up he said a deep grumbling voice when i was young and strong my master used me hard
to serve i serve him well he carried heavy loads and carried them far
not that i am old and weak i can not work he leaves me without no food or water
the tiger jumped on brahmin brahmin spoke the ti the tiger jumped the brahmin spoke
very quickly
oh but this is only the second brother tiger
we pro we pose to ask five
the tiger grumbled the
the a good deal at last but
i mean but at last we he went again with the brahmin on again
and after a time
they saw an eagle flying
in the sky the brahmin called up to him oh brother eagle
brother eagle tell
us if it seems fair for this tiger should eat me
when he i have just saved him from his cage frightful cage the eagle scared soared slowly overhead a moment then he came lower and spoke in a
thin clear voice i live high in the air he said
and i do not harm any man yet when men find my babies then they
they stone
my young and rob my nest and shoot
at me with arrows men are cruel
let the tiger eat brahmin
no matter what the tiger would have won right
cause after all the three <unk>
the tiger jumped on brahmin to eat him up the time the brahmin had to work very hard to keep him off at last the tiger stopped and walked on together a little while they saw an alligator he was lying at the side of a river's edge brother alligator said the brahmin does it seem right for that tiger
wants to eat me after i let him out of a cage
the old alligator turned in the mud and
grunted and snorted
then he said i lie here
the mud all day as harmless and harm n less as a bird
b but man but i hunt no man
but every time a man see me they throws stones at me and
poke me with sharp sticks man men are worthless let the tiger eat brahmin man ye
at last tiger r
at la at last tiger tried to eat brahmin at once the poor br brahmin had to remind him again
that he had asked only four wait till we have one more
and wait until we see the fifth he begged
oh
finally the tiger walked on with him after a time the he met a little jackal coming happily down the road oh brother jackal said
brahmin
give us a pos <unk>
do you think it is fair the tiger eats me after i got him out of this terrible cage excuse me said the little jackal
i said
y i said yelled the brahmin i think it
it's fair that
the
do do you think it's fair that the tiger should eat me
when i fe
set i set him free from his cage cage said the little jackal yes yes cage said
the brahmin
we want to know what you think
i don't think
i don't think oh said the little jackal
you want my opinion
you may i ask
me to speak a little more loudly and a little more c clear i am a
little slow
i am
now what is that now what was it
do you think brahmin said i right for tiger i mean it's right for it
is four the tiger to eat me after i set him from his cage
what cage said the jackal why the cage he was in said the brahmin you see but don't understand said the jackal
you set him free you s
yes yes said the brahmin
it went this way i walked along
and i saw a tiger oh dear s oh dear said the jackal i'll never understand
talk like
that
with a a long story
if you really want my op opinion clear what sort of <unk> was it
why a big plain cage an iron one
said the brahmin that gives me no idea at all said the little jackal listen my friends
if you want are going to get to the bottom of this
the me the spot
then an the then i could understand in a jiffy
show me the cage so brahmin the tiger and the little jackal walked together
to the spot of the cage w
now let me see it
if i get it this said the little jackal
jackal
brahmin where were you
stood
here i stood here in the roadside said the brahmin and tiger where were you said the little jackal i was in the cage of course roared the tiger
well excuse me mister
said the little jackal i really am so silly
i cannot quite understand what happened little what you need to just
just a little practice how were you in the cage said what pos position were you in
i stood here said the tiger as he jumped out into the cage with my head
on my shoulder like this
so oh thank you thank you very much said the little jackal
it makes it it so much clearer but i still don't get quite understand it
please forgive me
slow mind
i mean i in my slow mind but i cannot come out by yourself
can't you see that the door shut me in said the tiger
oh i am sorry said the little jackal i know
i know i am very slow but i can understand thing unless i see just were
and could you show me the door
the door works i am sure could understand
how does it shut
it shuts like this said the brahmin pushing the it shut yes yes i don't
just but i don't see any lock said the little jackal does the lock
does it lock on the outside
it locks like this and the
oh does it really said the little jackal does it really well brother brahmin now
that you looked sh
i think you should
let it stay locked
as you
as for you my friend he s said
to the tiger i think you will be a good while before
you'll finally
you'll find any one who let's you out again
then he bowed to brahmin
good bye brother he said
a to you
know what is it the what is this way good bye
the little boy gets stuck in his hand i mean his hand gets stuck in the uhm jar because he is really greedy for nuts well i well lucky for me i don't like that much kinds of nuts
and i and if he and his mother tells him that just try to take out a few and he did a it worked but wh he basic i mean and his mother er said not to be so greedy next time
and he didn't want him he didn't she didn't want him to she wanted him to fix it instead of scream for his mother
well the tiger basically got captured for being evil and then he he asked the braham to let him out and the brahman tried to let him i mean the brahman let him out he tried he jumped on the uhm brahman then he's like wait this isn't fair you said you promised
and then he's like well let's just ask five people the five people who we meet and i think the brahman was pretty uhm smart because the tiger was in he must have been in but because that's when he bolted the door
pretty so the jackal's pretty smart eh so basically he was just asking stu he was just being stupid so the tiger would get back in the cage now that makes more sense
<br>
once a long time ago
where
no pink roses
all the roses in in
the world were white
they wanted they
there weren't any red
ones any yellow ones or any pink ones
there were were only white ones
very early one morning a little white
rose
bud
poke up
she saw the sun looking at her
she started so hard that the white rosebud didn't know what to do
so she looked up at the
up at him and said why are you looking at me so hard
because you are pretty said the
b
big round sun
and the little white rose
blushed and turned pink
after that all th
her children were pink roses
what great time i'll have eating this meat when i get home
said bill the dog he began to cross
the stream of water
he stopped suddenly and looked down into the water there was
there was a another dog looking back at him
from
inside the stream
hey he s
hey
he s
has a bigger piece of meat
than i do he said
i want that piece i'm going to get it
bill grew
growled but the dog in
the water didn't move
he didn't drop
his meat either
bill started f
bill started very hard at the stared very hard at the dog in the water bill thought that if he could care
if he s could st
if he could scare him the other dog would drop his me
bill barked at the dog in the water
he was soon sorry for that because the meat slipped from his mouth and sank
to the bottom of the stream
the dog in the water lost his meat at the same time
and
poor
bill wanted
went home hungry
well uhm
sil
a
sil
there was roses and they were all white and one day another one started growing and the sun was staring at it and and the sun was staring at it because it was so beautiful and it blushed into pink
sil
well the dog had a piece of meat and on the way home he saw another dog in the river with a bigger piece of meat which was really him and uhm the dog wanted the piece of meat so he he
sil
he did stuff to that he think would scare the dog and when he barked the piece of meat fell out of his mouth and sank to the bottom of the river
ramona and rita sat on the back porch of their new home they had moved the country just they moved to the country just two weeks ago ramona still missed the city
he missed their old school he missed playing with his friends on their street rita finished
tying string onto a kite
what a great day for flying a kite she smiled at her brother just listen to the wind in the trees i hate the country ramona said it's too quiet here
it's not so quiet said rita there are lots of sounds they're just not the same kinds of sounds that you hear in new york
just listen ramona
no
ramon
ramon listened he heard a bird singing
he heard cowbells ringing from the farm down the road he heard the soft sound of wind blowing through the trees
when they heard something
strange what was that asked rita i don't know ramon ra
ramon looked around the porch he saw nothing but some empty bottles i think the house is groaning whispered rita
maybe it's the wind said ramon
the sound stops when the wind stops it starts when the wind blows it's the house that's making the noise i don't like it ramon said rita
the wind
blew
they heard the sound again this time ramon knew it what it was
ramon walked over to the empty
walked over to the empty bottles on the porch rita followed he picked up a bottle and blew across the top of it
there it was that strange sound
so that's what's been making those odd noises said a voice behind them their mother was standing at the door
why does the bottle make that sound mom asked rita
she felt silly for thinking
that the house had groaned come inside said their mother we can talk while i work
ramon said rita p
ramon and rita picked up the bottles and followed their mother into the house
several boxes sat at the kitchen floor mom was taking dishes out of one box and putting them away when you blow across the top of a bottle mom explained the air inside the bottle vibrates
what does vibrate mean asked ramon
well the air inside the bottle moves back and forth very quickly mom answered these movements are called vibrations
dad came into the room
look kids he said i can show you what vibrations are he held a rubber band in his hand dad pulled the rubber band tight between two fingers pull the rubber band rita he said and then let it go
ramon watched rita pull the rubber band and let go it moved quickly it made a funny sound did you see the rubber band vibrate asked dad it moved back and forth very fast and made it the air around it move very fast the air moving back and forth those movements are vibrations right asked ramon
and vibrations make the sounds right asked
right asked rita mom smiled you're both right she said those vibrations move through the air into our ears mom explained
our ears send a message to our brain
and that's how we hear sounds rita picked up a bottle it was shorter than the others she blew it across the top of it that bottle sounds like a whistle said ramon that's right said dad a tall bottle makes a deep sound
there is more room inside it the air to vibrate a shorter bottle makes a higher sound
it has less room inside for the air to vibrate
dad said ramon we have many sizes of bottles
will they all make different sounds
let's try them said dad each bottle made a different sound
i
told you there were lots of things to hear
around here joked rita
then a new sound filled the room
it's thunder said mom there must be a storm
we'd better shut the windows ramon and rita raced to close the windows dad closed the door they finished just in time the wind started blowing harder suddenly the house really did begin to groan
everyone looked around where is that awful noise coming from asked mom i never heard a sound like that in new york rita whispered ramon was standing near the fireplace
when they heard the groan again i think it's coming from the fireplace he said the fireplace is making that spooky sound the wind slowed down for a moment then house became quiet again
rita began to laugh it's not spooky she said it's just
the chimney the chimney is like a giant bottle when the wind blows over it the air inside vibrates and because it's so tall it makes a really deep sound ramon added i think ramon and rita are right laughed mom
as if to prove that they had seen the wind blew again the house groaned

to go see harry potter it was nice
why did a panda with the beautiful girl name yin yin have her name changed to
name columbus it was fred's idea so let's begin with fred
fred fred
fred fed the panda bears and tigers and turtles the turtles weren't so bad but as for the tigers he wasn't so sure
he didn't mind handling with the raw meat he had to feed the ti to the tigers his main objection was to being eaten no one could blame fred really since no one really wants to be eaten some
people
do like to bite their finger nails but fred wasn't a nail biter so being eaten was definitely not something he looked forward to each afternoon at three o'clock when it was time to feed the tigers
for fred when it came to the panda's he had a warm spot in his heart
actually it was a eighty five degrees
uh actually it was a eighty five
n
five degrees on his left kidney but the point is that he was very fond of feeding the panda's
there were three panda's
and they were known as the pan family
they
were
in order of cuteness yin yin the young daughter poo poo the mother and moo man the gentle and always sleepy father
many people know that pandas eat bamboo a lot of it
a lot of bamboo can get quite heavy so because of the pandas fred became very strong
was in terrific shape
but physical fitness was not
only
reason that fred loved the pandas
the other reason was that
anyone
who gets within three feet of a panda automatically falls in love with them
it's a law of nature
at further distance pandas have a strange almost magical effect on human
beings which makes us want to hug and squeeze things
fred was not allowed to actually hug the panda bears since that
could be dangerous
so
all the other people at the zoo would
know that the pandas
had just been had just been fed when they saw fred hugging
the
rather un cuddly palm tree outside of
the panda's room
it is interesting to point out at this
time that more stuffed panda bears
are so old at zoo gift shop
then all
of the other stuff animals combined
this
this can certainly be accounted for
by this strange almost magical effect that the panda possess
but everything was not all bamboo
and hugs at the zoo
one morning fred was feeding yin yin and said
oh yin yin
i wish that more people would come to visit the zoo
i know i shouldn't be telling you this
but we m
might have to sell you and your family to the big zoo
in sa in angeles
if we don't get more money
that
it's not that you're
you aren't selling enough stuffed panda bears
it's just that we're
it's just that there hasn't been enough
coming
to see the first place i think
what the zoo needs is a great everything
companion
fred was starting to feel
the uncontrollable
urge
to hug the panda
so
before he ran off to hug the palm
tree
quickly he said it costs so much to
feed you panda bears
i would hate
if you had to leave us
after all
it's only home you know besides
if you
leave
i'll get terribly out of shape
now if you excuse me i need
to squeeze something before i scream
but yin yin panda was not listening to fred
she was talking to her best friend
maggie the magpie about going
to the moon
yes the big one in the sky that is mostly
not mostly likely not made of cheese
and most certainly not made of bamboo
yin yin and her best friend maggie
magpie who looked a lot like a panda if
a lot like a panda would look if
pandas were birds
were discussing
were discussing about going to the moon
her mother and father knew i
knew what they were talking about since they hadn't
hadn't talked
for
though
they hadn't thought or talked of much else since
yin yin said i want to go there and pointed to the moon
that's
another that's enough of this
that's enough of this nonsense said yin yin's mother poo poo
what sort of nonsense is this for young panda bear going to the moon indeed
nonsense your job is to be cute so people want to
run to the gift shop
and buy panda bear dolls
it's simple economics like it or not
we are
spoke
spokespeople
for the panda stuffed
animal industry
which young lady helps for pay for the bamboo
that you eat such such nonsense
going to the moon said her mother poo poo
but i just learned
how to
but i just learned how to make how to make myself into a ball and roll in two days
roll two days
ago and i'm becoming very good at it
i don't think
it'll it'll take
i don't think it will take that long to roll there said yin yin
yin yin's father moo man
didn't
didn't think
it was very proper for a wise young panda bear to go rolling off to places
but where there wasn't any bamboo but he was supportive of his young daughter
and showed his support by taking a nap
but before he fell
to sleep he did
did manage to say
i believe rolling is a decidedly round about way to go
if you
must go it will be best to fly
nonsense said the mother
i'm so mad i'm going to look at that lady over there and make her want to squeeze
her son
i'm so mad i'm going to look at that lady over there make her want to squeeze her son cheeks
she said spitefully
an instant
later a young boy was
heard saying
ouch mom cut that out
i'm sorry to say but
but many a little boy's cheeks have been
made
i'm sorry to say but
many a little boy's cheeks
have been
made raw
made raw when mother poo poo panda was upset
yin yin was always one to take good advice from her father
and less than a week later yin yin and maggie had built a rocket ship out of bamboo
bamboo is a very workable substance and pandas
tend to handle bamboo a lot so this itself
was not that
astonishing at least
to yin yins parents fred sure was impressed though
i know
the main obstacle
it turns out
was
the main obstacle it's turns out
it the main obstacle it turns out was
getting the rocket ship off the ground
maggie
figured that if
her and three of her strongest magpie friends
were to each grab hold of a corner
of
the
rocket ship
they could all fly to the moon so they tried
one two three to the moon
they said together pulling with all their might
i see your wing flapping but we don't seem to be going anywhere said yin yin
hmm
heavier
than i thought i think we will need more magpies said maggie
yes but how many more
yin yin said i'm not sure exactly replied maggie
the father watching this all through one eye
for he always
had at least one
eye asleep at all
times said
uh
said
t'wouldn't
wo
t'would would be best
to ask the owl then closed his eye
so maggie flew to the owl and
asked for his advice oh wise owl
i have a question that i fear
only you can answer she said
how to turn your head all the way around without getting a terrible pain in your neck
said owl
no how many magpie
would be needed to fly
a four hundred pound panda bear
and a one hundred
pound bamboo rocket ship
to
to the moon said maggie
the owl instantly
replied two hundred thousand and seventy six
or take two
give or take two
a week later maggie managed to round up two hundred thousand and seventy eight magpie
she could be
a very perceived little bird
when she wanted
a week later despite much flapping they were still trying
to get
the rocket in the air it turns out
that the owl didn't take consideration
that once you ever get a thousand magpie
together they tend to fight
and can't agree on a single thing
now while this was going on do you suppose
do you supposed what fred was doing
like he was feeding the pandas like he was supposed to so one day
after fred had fed the pandas and was hugging
the palm tree
the zoo
manager came up to him and said
fred
what is going on with your pandas fred
i've never seen anything like it
it's taken me a couple weeks to figure out it out but
i think yin yin wants to go to the moon and magpies want to take her there
said fred
oh well that makes sense then said the manager
did you know that since the little panda built
that bamboo rocket ship
and those magpies said started fluttering about
that
that
zoo's profits
have gone up four thousand percent
this is
just the type of exposure
we needed
those panda's
will be with
us for a long time
fred
thought about it and said you know
i think we should rename yin yin columbus
the k the zoo keeper said good heavens man that is a great idea
no wait
no wait a second
i don't understand
well sir
well sir
when columbus set out
on his ship he was really trying to find a quicker way to get around
europe in order to im
trade
he
wanted a busi to be
a business man but
instead became a great explorer
yes but what does that have to do
with the pandas man said the zoo keeper manager
well it seems to me sir that yin yin wanted be great explorer
and instead
and instead become a business woman
i see fred
one more thing sir about those magpies flying above the pandas
do you think that zoo could purchase me a large
sized umbrella
the zoo manager
the zoo manager
laughed and walked away but did purchase a fashionable yellow umbrella
for fred the next day
back in the in the panda's home the mother panda poo poo
was very proud of her daughter
after all
if it weren't for yin yin
they would they would have
had to move from their wonderful home
but later when fred walked into the panda's home under a his
new yellow umbrella all she could
think to say was nonsense
as for yin yin she was very
she was very proud to
be
renamed after a famous explorer
and she and
maggie never stopped trying to get to the moon
no
sil
uhm yin yin and maggie are trying to get to the moon
uh well they built a rocketship out of bamboo and they got like a lot of magpies to uhm lift the rocketship up to space and they never stopped trying
sil
to get to the moon
uhm
sil
well he he uhm
sil
uhm i can't really remember about that
sil
i remember that uhm
sil
that fred was kind of was kind of thinking about naming yin yin columbus
sil
uhm because he thought that yin yin wanted to be a good explorer and colmbus was an explorer so was thinking about renamed her columbus
ok so right
like
hey julio did you
hear there's going to be a big race in four weeks said dr drake great to his friend i'm going to the race in it
i'm going to race in it and i'm going to win julio laughed and
a laughed at derek and said oh really prove it i'll race you it at to my house and we'll see who wins ready set go
shouted derek
the two boys ran as fast as they could at
first
could at first they were running at the same speed
he's not so great thought julio
but after a while derek was far ahead of julio derek turned and shouted
told you told you i'm going to win the race
you might
you might as well not even sign up julio
julio was mad
he could
hardly catch his breath
his body felt tired when he got home
he slammed the door behind him what's wrong
his big sister elena asked there's going to be a big race derek is going to beat me he beats me at everything julio said said sadly
even sign up and had an idea why don't you train
for the race how do i do that julio asked
come to
track track
practice tomorrow you can talk to my coach i'm sure she can help you said elena
the next day julio went to see coach
benson if you want to be a
better runner there
are three things you should do she said first you should run for fifteen minutes every day how will that help asked julio when you run you use a lot of muscles in your body accept
explained coach benson
you
your muscles aren't used to
aren't used to running
wait
muscles aren't used to running if you you run a little every day your muscles will get stronger
misses
<unk>
that are ex that are ex exercising
can work longer without getting tired
ok said julio
what else can i do in the race you not only want to be able to run and not get tired
you also want to run fast
said coach benson so the second thing you should do is some
sprinting you should do
it even other day
do you know what sprinting means
julio thought for a moment he and
never heard what w word that word before i don't think so coach he said pick up pick a spot that is not too far away race to it as fast as you can race for a minute then
race r
race to race for a minute then race back
to where you started that's what sprinting means do you
do that for ten t
four
do that four times explained coach benson and don't forget to warm up before you run a
is the
that is the third important thing to do
your sister can show you how
julio looked
at
elena what
what does warming up mean he asked warming up means
doing stretching exe
exe
exercises his elena said you stretch your muscles muscles
muscles that you haven't been stretching can get hurt
it always
is always good to str stretch before running ok big sister show me what to do said julio for the next four weeks julio went to the park every day training for the race was training for the race was not easy sometimes he didn't feel like running
him but he made himself do it
anyway he
pr
practiced just like the coach and his sister
told him to he always stretched his muscles before he ran
every other
day julio worked on his speed he w would choose a tree not too far away and race to it he would
rest
by counting to sixty
then he would run back to where he started then he'd do it over again each time he practiced sprinting he thought of what
he it would be like when he
beat when he beat drake in the big race at first julio found
found it hard to run he always
he was out of breath he could feel his heart pounding in his chest but as the f
as the days passed he ran longer and farther without getting tired his muscles got stronger the strong
er he got the more
he could run the
he wa
mmm he
used his watch to time himself and he knew he was getting faster he was
happy at no
at how well he was doing
now
when he ran to
ran his heart beat steadily
every day he wrote
w
wrote down in his notebook how much he had run
finally the day of the big race came everyone in school was at the track the the runners
t time
l lined up to start
derek turned to julio and said i'm sor
i'm surprised that you're even here i'm the one who will win this race y
julio didn't say anything he was too busy warming at last
the big moment came the principal of the school called
out on your mark as get set go the race was on as quickly as they could drake and they could
derek and another runner came named beth
took the lead suddenly drake started to slow down
he was tired and out of breath as
as they raced around the track julio sped
sped
past
drake now beth was the only runner ahead of julio he poured
he powered on the speed
but so did beth
now julio understood why the coach had told him to practice
sprinting as the two runners crossed the finish line julio broke the tape
beth was
a close second julio became
beamed as the principal placed a medal
around his neck he had run
he had run his very best that day and he had
beaten drake julio turned to beth
i bet you practice don't you
sure i do i want to be on the track
team
some day said beth so i so do i said julio
do you think we could practice running together
ok meet me tomorrow afternoon
she said you're on julio grinned
well uhm julio and drake both wanted both uhm entered the uhm race and uhm and uhm then julio like like kind of got mad cause like like drake said like i'm going to beat you and stuff like that and uhm uhm
sil
and uhm then uhm julio's sister said that
<unk>
that that he could like go to her running class thing and uhm her julio's sister teacher said that make sure you practice every day to win and stuff
cassie looked at the postcard it had no postmark or stamp because it came in a letter to her mother it was from a aunt
aunt red
wing
ever since aunt red wing had
begun to
travel she had put postcards for cassie in mother's letters
letters uhm aunt
aunt red wing took people on trips all over the world
the postcards she sent
cassie
always had a riddle about
where she was this postcard read
cassie s
do to
<unk>
studied the riddle i wondered how the length of shadows
in
tell can tell where aunt red
aunt red wing is i think
i'll ask matt
cassie thought
her brother matt was
in high school she worked after s
school he worked after school
aunt at the public library cassie liked to visit him there
as she walked to the library cassie read the riddle over
and over again
n noon shadows
are
long the sun
the sun sets soon
where it is
cold
in the month of june
she had some ideas but she
wanted to ask matt a question
hi said matt when cassie came to his desk
what's new
hi said cassie
look what i have another postcard from aunt
aunt red wing
matt laughed
that means you have another riddle to figure out
yes i do cassie said shadows are first clue to the riddle
can you tell seasons by the length of shadows
you certainly can said matt he reached for the lamp on his desk look on the floor cassie
uhm what do you see when i hold the lamp like this cassie looked on the floor
i see a short shadow
she said
but i don't see what it has to do with the seasons
let
let's pretend that
that this lamp is the sun
said matt
what is what when
the light shines from above the shadow is short during the summer
the n the noon wait
the noon
uhm
sun is in the sky and shadows are shorter but when i hold
the lamp at this angle
the shadow grows longer that's right said matt
when i hold the lamp at an angle like
it's noon
that
sun is in winter the shadows are long
aunt red
wing is the place where it noon shadows are long said cassie
si si science
since the noon is sun and
wait no since the noon is sun
low in the winter it must be
where aunt red wing is cassie was proud of herself
that's right said matt
what's next
what's the next clue
the second clue is that

his mother

maybe i can help
tell me about your goldfish said
the man said

their names are
<unk>
my name is tom
glad to meet you tom
my name is mr
chu
chu
chu
what
seems to be wrong with
melvin
they don't seem to be happy said tom
when i
got them two weeks ago
they swam
a
lot
faster
than they do now
i think they may be sick
do you feed your fish tom
asked mr
ch
chu
ch
chu
s yes sir
i put just a little food on
the top
of the water
i like to watch them swim to the top and eat it
they make funny faces when they eat
they
when they wiggle
and swim
a ways
tom said
it sounds like you are feeding them
the right way
it is good that you take care of your
pets said mr
sh
chu
s
why don't we
look at the
fish here in the store you can show me
what
kind of
gold
of goldfish you have
the
that might help us
find out what is wrong with your pets
tom and mr chu walked
to the back of the s
pet store
said
t
and
was full of all kinds of fish they
were also
they
ok
were also
flying
filled with bubbles
why do you
why do you put bubbles in the fish tanks asked tom
it looks like the fish are taking a bubble bath
ok
those bubbles are
filling
with
a
air
explained mr chu
fish need to breath air just like people do
to keep our fish healthy we can clean
we
can
wait we clean their air
and water
we use a air pump to
put
fresh air
into their tanks
the air pump makes the bubbles
how does the water get clean asked tom
the air pump
pushes
the water through
a filter
answered mr chu
the filter works like a net
it traps the dirt in
it <unk>
traps the dirt
cl
are
col
collects
collects
the
in the water
when the
water comes
out of the pump
it is clean
tom looked at
his fish
but he couldn't stop thinking about the bubbles
mr chu
why are
some
bubbles big
why
are some small
some bubbles have more air in them than other bubbles
a bubble holds
air just like a balloon said mr chu
the more air you blow in the balloon
the bigger it gets
tom looked at the bubbles in the fish tanks
my fishbowl doesn't have
an air pump he said
there are no bubbles
of air in the water
is
that why my
fish are sick
maybe said mr chu
how often do you change the water
in the bowl
i haven't changed it said tom
is
if you don't use a pump you must change the water twice a week said mr chu
when you give your fish fresh water
they'll start to feel better
they will get
p
plenty of air to breathe
thank you mr chu said tom
i want my fish to be health happy and healthy
it's
up to me to take care of them
are lucky to have
a good friend
like you said mr chu
as he
waved goodbye to tom
the fish uhm got sick and the and he took him to that guy and at the pet store and uhm he helped them and they needed bubbles to breath
sil
and be healthy
every four years turtles from all over the land would crawl to great pond
it would take some turtles
there was lots of eating and l
every four years turtles from all over the land would crawl to the great pond
it would take some turtles from far away villages two whole weeks just to get there
drought dwellers
festival
where there was lots of eating and laughing
turtles could catch up with friends they had not seen since the last festival
everything about the festival was fun
but the main that event was the great turtle race the winner of the great turtle race was so important that he or or she didn't have to move for four years until the next festival
the less a turtle moves the bigger they get and
the longer they live
so you can see winning the great
race is a good honor
the turtle cup was the trophy that the winner would take home in their village
there was the most famous turtle
there was
he was the slowest turtle of all time
he hadn't had to move for over fifty years he was the biggest most respected and also one of the trickiest turtles there was there was
there was were many
legends about him
it was r morning he was so slow
his heart would only beat beat once a day
his name was mud
and he was the greatest
champion in the history of shell dweller's festival
he was unbeatable
when mud
was in his prime there was a new turtle born in blue pond for the turtle was named swish when swish was born
everyone thought he was a little slow but as he got a little older the turtles began to realize that swish was really really really slow
once his mother called him in for dinner
and he didn't make it home until
breakfast the next morning
and he was only a foot away
blue pond was a nice village located about three days crawl from great pond
seven
hundred years so with swish they thought maybe just
maybe he could bring back the turtle cup to their pond
to their little pond
everyone treated swish differently for example
mr peeks the local shell cleaner would say
hey there swish do you want
a free shell waxing today
we all want you to look good when you bring home the cup mrs s snapper would say
hi swishy do you want some yummy pie to fill you up and slow
you down for the big race a fat turtle is a slow turtle
this snapper was never nice to anyone but she was being nice to swish
mrs peeks
would never do anything for free
but he was going to give swish a free
shell waxing
this was the kind of thing that swish would get all the time
all the extra attention made swish very uncomfortable he thought sure
they are nice to me now because they think i can win the race but if i lose
they'll be disappointed and mad at me i never promised that i would win
the race i can't beat mud anyway i heard
once it took him three days just to yawn
so one day he told his parents i don't want to race all the turtles in blue pond held a meeting to discuss the problem
the mayor dr softshell said this is ridiculous
swish was
has heard race he's the slowest turtle i've every seen
except for mud of course
without him we don't have a chance but he doesn't want to be treated special he just wants to be normal and he doesn't want everybody to hate him if he can't beat mud
you have to remember that even though he's gifted
at be being slow
h he's still very young
said swish's father
we never thought of that they all said the town agreed to treat swish like a normal turtle
and after a while swish decided that he would be proud to race for his village and the time of the festival
drew near all the turtles in the land
started toward great pond
swish had to be carried on his father's back since it would have taken
him months to get to great pond by himself
finally after the long journey all the turtles arrived
at great pond
this was swish's
first ever
shell dwellers festival
and he thought it was the most wonderful thing
he had ever seen
there were thousands of turtles all of all different s spices
all having a great time
look there's your cousin
peek a boo from big puddle village
said swish's mother you'll get to meet all sorts of new turtles
swish was suddenly very excited he told his mom s
you know what i'm going to win this race
i know it
and all these turtles will know that blue pond rules
i'm not afraid of stupid mud
swish's mom smiled and said
i know that you can win swish but it's an honor just to get
to race
said swish's mom
swish saw a rock in the middle of the field and wondered
how come they don't move that big rock
out of the field
it seems to be in everyone's way to swish
that's not a rock sweetie s said his mom that's mud
swish made a loud gulp sound
just do your best said his mom
swish's father said son i have something to tell you
as you know it your great great grand turtle raced mud once he wasn't as slow as you but he did teach about mud's dirty tricks then you whispered in
swish's ear
all
the tricks that his
great great grand turtle taught him
after seven days of playing and dancing and bug eating finally the day of the race ca came the mayor of the great pond miss
tort posted the rules of the race on a tree for everyone to see
rule number one
the great race begins at sunrise and ends at sunset
rule number two all turtles must run as fast as they can and the turtle that is closest to the starting line wins
rule number three no turtle may pretend to
be going fast but go slow instead
all turtles must go as fast as they
can
all at all times
since turtles never cheat this is the most important rule
to break this rule would mean an end to the great turtle race forever
rule number four no turtle may fall asleep
since if
you are asleep
you aren't running as fast as you can
swish read the rules even
though he knew
them by heart
then he heard
the mayor say runner's please take your positions the slowest turtles from each pond were carried to the starting
line by members of their villages
there were about three hundred turtles racing
the were
all the slowest of the slow
the turtles all stretched and thought really slow thoughts
as they
did the sky turned
from black to dark blue
they looked at the horizon
and saw the sun was starting
there rise just then the mayor said ready set slow and off they went
all the turtles were very very slow
so it took some time before anyone could figure out which turtles were the most slowest after a few hours
most of the turtles had gone a few feet all except two swish and mud
were both back at the starting line
it looked as if neither of them had moved at all
they were both moving of course but they were s so slow that it was hardly to tell after six hours mud and swish were still
tied and had only moved a few inches
by now all the turtles were usually way ahead of mud
but this time swish was just as slow
mud knew that this would be his closest race ever and he was actually getting a little bit scared
who is this young punk he thought to himself
mud said to swish there's no way that a turtle as young
as you can be so slow even i was
faster than you
when i was your age you're cheating
you're going to ruin the great race forever
but swish wouldn't let mud scare him
you're just trying to make me quit
i'm not going to fall for your tricks he said
turtles never cheat and i'm a turtle with honor
then mud tried
another trick
he started singing a soft beautiful b
swish started yawning
he was tired
he was tired from racing and thought that it would be nice to just listen to mud's sweet voice and fall asleep
then he snapped out of it and remembered his father had warned him of h this trick
he reached in his shell and pulled out a couple of earplugs
he put the earplugs on his ears and couldn't hear mud's singing anymore mud kept singing his lullaby for a few hours but he stopped right before sunset
the crowd thought he must have realized
that his singing trick wasn't working
but then right as the end
but then right at the end right before the sunset
swish
started to pull ahead of mud
oh no shouted the fans mud's winning it looks like mud is still the greatest turtle of them all
and when the sun went down mud was the closest turtle to the starting line
swish was sad that he lost but al all the turtles from blue pond cheered
for swish they were very proud he gave mud such
a close race
swish was t happy too but deep down inside he knew he was just as slow as mud
the mayor of pondland went to present
the turtle cup to sludge pond again
she announced
well mud it looks like
you've done it sludge pond wins
the turtle cup again this time it was a bit closer
than you would have liked
hello bet
what would you like to say
to all the turtles at the festival the crowd started yelling speech speech
mud didn't answer the mayor tapped mud
on the shell and said hello hello mud
mud still didn't answer in fact mud was sound asleep
mud had actually sung himself to sleep
ladies and gentlemen
she said
mud from sludge pond has been
dis
<unk>
for
sleeping during the race this means that we have a new champion
the real winner is swish
softbelly of blue pond the crowd went wild
mrs t
ort for went up to swish and gave him the turtle cup she said swish you are the youngest winner of the great turtle
race that was the most exciting finish we've ever had
i think that you'll be a great champion
for many years since turtles only get
slower with age
for the first time in six hundred years
i would like to present the turtle cup to blue pond the crowd went wild again
swish took the cup that day f for the first time
he would take it many more times after that
it was because of swish that
blue pond became
the most respected pond in the land
he would never lose the turtle cup for the rest of his long life
but though
became the greatest he became the greatest and biggest turtle of all time much greater or bigger than mud he always made
sure that no one
treated him special
and that he treated everybody like he wanted to be treated like a turtle with honor
uh the uhm turtle uh he uhm he he was born and he heard about uhm mud so uhm then
sil
uhm he heard there was a big race and mud was was the bestest and then everyone treated him really special
sil
and uhm then he didn't want to do the race because everybody was treating him special so then people uhm his father told uhm they had a big meeting
sil
and his his father spoke that uhm they they they should treat him like they treat normal people and so then uhm swish went in the race
sil
and then uhm
<br>
and then his he uhm uhm it was here at the rules and then uhm
<br>
uhm the race began and s s swish and uhm
sil
swish and uhm mud were were tied but then swish was ahead of him but uhm
sil
mud was really sleeping and so uhm then uh the
sil
the uhm the t the uhm they thought they thought that mud won but he was really asleep and one of the rules if you were sleeping that was cheating and so then uh swish won cause cause he was awake and he was the slowest and then he got really happy
from a peacock he picked these up with his bill and placed them on his own
feathers then he danced back and forth looking
at his fine new coat he even tried to
tried to walk like a peacock
the peacocks came into the yard
they did not know what to think at first did
then they saw that the crow was trying to dress like
dress and act like they did they flew
they flew at him calling away with the cheat away with the cheat they pulled out all the peacock feathers
and
many of his black ones
the crow was glad to get away alive he flew back to his own family and old friends but one of the crows had seen him in the barnyard and told the others he was silly he h
how silly he had been acting
where have you been they cried we know we know
we will not have you in this flock away away
and they drove him away even the owls will
he had always hated
made eyes
at him and screamed cheat
cheat
he flew into the forest
there in a tree by a pond lived a
lonely life
the
tree toads leaned their funny song from him this is
a warning
to them don't
be
don't
don't be be cheat
don't b
don't don't be cheat
once upon a time a tortoise lived in a pond with a duck two ducks
they were
her very good friends she liked the ducks
she could talk with them as much as she liked
the tortoises liked to talk
she liked the sound of her voice
the tortoise and the duck lived together for a long time
then a pond ran out of water
the ducks and
the
tortoise had no water to swim in
the two
ducks could not live without water
they were going to fly away
to more water they went to the tortoise to say goodbye
if you
oh don't leave me said the tortoise if
take me with you i will die if i stay here but you can not fly said the ducks
how can we take you with us
take me with you take me with you said the tortoise
the ducks felt bad they had a an idea of how to take her
we have a way to take you they said but you must not move we will each take one end of a stick
you take the middle of
in
your mouth then we
will fly you up in the air but do not
talk
or if you open your mouth you will fall
the tortoise said she would
not say a word she would not even make her mouth
move her mouth
she was very happy so the ducks got a strong stick and held the ends the tortoise bit the middle
the two ducks flew away with their friend
they were high over the trees the tortoise wanted to say how high we are
but she could not talk
the stick was in her mouth she kept
she so she kept still
then
they saw a pretty house she wanted to say what is that but she kept quiet
then they came to a town people looked up and
saw them look at the ducks carrying a tortoise they said everyone to went ran to look
the tortoise wanted to say be quiet
but she did not
this is funny look it
look at it
look they said
the tortoise forgot the stick she opened her mouth to say hush she fell to the ground
that was the end of the tortoise
it is very good
to be able to q
be quiet
uhm
sil
he tries to be a peacock and he uhm uhm one of the other crows s uhm sees him in the barnyard trying to be a peacock and he tells the other crows and so they make him go away and then he finds this place in the forest
well uhm there were very good friends in the pond and then the pond dries up so the ducks have to fly away but the tortoise says he'll die she'll die there
and then the ducks have an idea how to bring them with them bring them bring him with them and uhm they they grab two ends of a stick and he puts his she puts his mouth in the middle and h uhm he can't he can't talk or else he'll fall
and uhm then he wants to say hush to the people who are saying ooh look at him look at him her look at her and then uhm she opens her mouth and says hush and she falls and she dies
one day a long long time ago it was very cold winter was coming and all the birds flew away to
to the warm south
there they would wait for the spring
the little bird a broken wing and could not f could not fly
he did not know what to do he looked all round to see if there was any place where he could keep warm
he saw trees of the big forest
maybe the trees will keep me warm through the winter he said
so he went to the forest hopping
and fluttering with his broken wing first he came to was a silver
birch
beautiful birch tree he said
will you let me live in your warm branches until the springtime comes
oh my said the birch
what a thing to ask
i have to take care of my own leaves through the winter go away
the little bird hopped and fluttered with his broken wing until he came to the next
tree it was a great big oak tree
oh big oak tree said the little bird will you let me live in your warm branches until the springtime comes what a thing to ask said the oak tree if you stay in my branches all winter you'll be eating my acorns go away
so the little bird hopped and fluttered with his broken wing til he came to a willow tree by the edge of the brook
oh willow tree said the little bird
will you let me live in your warm branches until the springtime comes
no said the willow tree i never talk to strangers go away
the poor little bird did not know where to go but he hopped and fluttered along with his broken wing the spruce tree saw him and said where are you going little bird
i do not know said the bird the trees will not let me live with them and my wing is broken and i cannot fly you may live in on one of my branches said the spruce
here is the warmest one of all
but may i stay all winter
yes said the spruce
i will li
to have you
the pine tree stood beside the spruce when he saw the little bird hopping and fluttering with his broken wing he said my branches are not very warm but i can keep the wind off because i'm big and strong
so the little bird fluttered up into the warm branches of the spruce the pine tree kept the wind off his house
the then the
juniper tr
saw
what the pine
and spruce were doing
the little bird was very happy in his warm nest f
from the wind with jumper juniper berries to eat
the trees at the edge of the forest talked to each other i wouldn't take care of a strange bird said the birch i wouldn't risk my acorns said the oak i wouldn't talk to strangers said the willow and three tree stood up very tall and proud
the night
that night the north wind came to the woods to play he blew the leaves with his icy breath
and every leaf
he touched fell to the ground
he wanted to touch ever leaf in the forest
he loved to see the bare trees may i touch every leaf he said to his father the forest king
no said the forest king the trees which were kind to the bird
with the broken wing may keep their leaves
so north wind had to leave them alone the spruce and pine and the juniper tree kept their leaves all through the winter and they have done so ever nice
sil
can i take this off
sil
a bird with a broken wing went to find a place to be warm three of the trees didn't let him go the next tree came to asked him where he was going and he said i don't know
sil
and
sil
the tree let him in
sil
then
sil
he climbed onto the warmer branch
sil
then
sil
the three trees that he came to before that that th they didn't let him why they didn't let him go in and then they all helped him at the end

she
rushed
that monday ruth
leaned back in the warm grass
she
she could see
a cloud
dragon
suddenly a door slammed
doc is home
ruth said jumping to her feet
doctor bell lived next door
doc liked to ride in balloons
doc took her
big balloon to
the park
her friends always
helped to fill the
balloon with air
then to heat the air so the balloon would rise
doc would climb in a
large basket tied to
the balloon
the
then the
balloon would
lift doc
towards the clouds hi
ruth found doc by her garage
she was looking
at her
big thermometer ruth knew that the thermometer
measures the temperature of the air
as the air warms the red liquid
in the
gas tube rises
as the air
cools liquid in the air
red
in the
tube falls
balloons are hard t hard to fly said doc
you
need the right kind of weather
she looked at the sky
let's see what the clouds
tell us about the weather
ruth laughed how can the clouds tell us anything doc pointed to f fluffy
white clouds in the sky those
those clouds are
<unk> clouds
they
tell
us
what fair weather is here
fair weather
is balloon weather said doc ruth smiled
they look like balls of cotton
doc showed ruth pictures of other kinds of clouds
curse clouds
high in the sky are thin and white
and curly
they tell me
that the
weather might change in about a day
so
<unk> clouds mean it's nice out and
circulus clouds that
mean
ch
change said ruth
a third
kind of cloud
is for
start
stratus
said doc
it's thick
it's a thick low cloud
that covers the sky
fog
s
doors
clouds near the ground
what d
what are clouds made of asked ruth
clouds are made of tiny drops of
water and bits of ice doc explained i
haven't
idea she said suddenly you watch the clouds this week
when the weather's right
we'll go up for a balloon ride
ruth asked her parents if she could go
they said yes she couldn't wait
next morning ruth saw fog
it filled the sky with thick low clouds
stars
clouds she said no balloon ride today
on wednesday the sun was shining ruth dressed
in a rush and ran to find doc
she opened
the back door she saw
mr hill's flapping flag in the wind she
thought
about being blown across the sky in the big balloon
i can't
see why balloonists
don't go up in the wind she thought
it wasn't a balloon after all
early thursday morning ruth called doc
there's no rain no wind
the weather's just right
there's a few
sun wheels in the cloud
in the sky
you're right ruth said doc let's go
at the park ruth watched
the big
orange balloon fill with air it got bigger and bigger
the balloon looked like a
pa
a big pumpkin to ruth
it's a pumpkin balloon she shouted doc helped her climb into the basket
doc's friends untied the ropes slowly the balloon rose
ruth's eyes got very big i feel just like a bird
the pumpkin balloon floated over land
it floated above ruth's school
it floated above mister hills flag it was so nice to be up high b
l
but less than an hour the wind began to go we better land now said doc
ruth didn't mind she had great a great time
soon the big pumpkin balloon was back on the ground thank you very much
doc said ruth
sure doc
replied
like having company would you like to go up again
oh yes said ruth what a good day it has been now ruth could watch the sky every day she could hardly wait
for a clear blue sky or some
some
l with and clouds without any wind
then
what happens in the story is that uhm
sil
ruth uhm
sil
gets to see uhm doc and and and doc says that she should keep on watching the sky and uhm
sil
when she has uhm
<br>
finished watching the sky until thursday she sees that there's uhm
sil
no uhm clouds that are except for circulus sil clouds and the uhm
sil
the wind is blowing a little bit and so she tells doc this and uhm doc eventually says they can go up in a balloon and then when about an hour later uhm the wind picks up and so doc says they should land the balloon and they did but uhm ruth didn't mind because it had been fun and she said she wanted to do it again
bryan and judy ann were best friends
they lived next door to each other in a small town west of
new orleans
louisiana
a creek ran behind their houses
at night judy ann and bryan
could hear the sounds of the frogs and insects that lived near the creek
one saturday judy ann and bryan were riding their bicycles
they were crossing the bridge over the creek when suddenly bryan stopped what's up
asked judy
there's something down in the creek
see
see
it looks like a bumpy old log
they both jumped back when
when the log splashed and dragged itself up the bank
wow
i've seen alligators before but never this close bryan said
sure enough a big alligator was wrestling on the bank of the creek
of their creek
it was black and tan
its wet bumpy
hide shone
in the sun
then it crawled back into the muddy water
only its head still t showed
i want that alligator
i don't want that alligator getting c
getting cassie
i'm
my cat
declared judy
ann
maybe we can help it get back where it belongs
ok
let's go go get my dad said bryan
mr degas
listened to the children's
breathless n news
what do we do asked bryan
let's call the fire department
said judy ann
now that's a good idea answered mr degas
mr degas
d
<unk>
the emergency number
and
explained about the alligator
call dr bob thomas
the fireman said
nature and science center
dr thomas is a scientist
he knows about reptiles
in a truck that had wildlife rescue painted on it
the truck pulled a trailer with a boat
bryan and judy ann looked up
at dr thomas
he was very tall
he smiled through the
through the curly brown and gray beard
come see the alligator judy ann cried
it invited
it
invited
our neighborhood
said bryan
it invaded our neighborhood said bryan
dr thomas laughed
alligators live h lived here
long before people did
dr
you might say win
what invaded
its neighborhood
dr thomas
explained that he was going to catch the alligator and take it to a place far away from where people lived
he took a long pole out of his
truck
the pole had
lots
on each end
our use this to catch the alligator he said
the handle is square to keep the pole from
twisting while
i use it
why is one loop bigger than the other asked judy ann
because alligators come in different sizes
answered dr thomas
alligators can run for only a short distance but they can run fast
so why don't you stand a little father away if you want to watch continued dr thomas as he walked down toward the animal
what do alligators eat asked bryan
well dr thomas answered
turtles or snake and snakes
i'll bet it's waiting for its lunch right now
said bryan usually dr said dr thomas explained when an alligator wants to eat
it waits quietly in the water
until something comes by
then the alligator snaps up meat
meal
and tosses it down
its throat
but once the jaws are
shut
i can easily hold them closed
otherwise it would be too dangerous to catch by hand
i would have to use a trap
dr thomas looked
took some big
black rubber
from his pocket
see their big see these bands
he asked
dr thomas pulled on his
high black boots
he eased himself gently
into the creek's brown water
slowly now
don't
send the waves to
warn
the alligator
to warn the alligator
he said to himself
dr thomas set
his feet firmly on the top muddy bottom
and gently
slipped
the
animal turned his dark eyes toward dr thomas and tried to dive
as it struggled
fiercely
to get away the loop closed tightly around its neck
dr thomas pulled the alligator to the surface and dragged it to shore
there was
there he was able to sit on the alligator
he tried
he tied up his
its front
and back legs
next he looped
he quickly pulled a black rubber
finally the alligator grew too tired to struggle
dr thomas had captured the alligator
now it was time to put the alligator
in the boat and bring it
to a new home
deep in the swamp
dr thomas would find a place where it would be
far from people
bryan and judy ann looked
at the alligator
then they looked at each other
they had heard plenty
of alligator
stories from their parents
and grandparents
now they had t ta a tale of their own to tell
and found an alligator in the creek and they asked their dad to call the fire department and the fire department told them to call a guy named doctor thomas doctor thomas captured the alligator to and t is going to move it to a new enclosure
sil
doctor thomas captured the alligator by putting a loop around its neck and a black rubber band around its nose
so where does this place do you start right here or right here
ok
taffy taffy where are you
cried scott
<unk> <unk> that taffy liked to the dog in the dirt
i
know where
taffy is he thought
he is
digging where they are building
the new road
scott raced past the
dump trucks he saw
taffy
chasing a mole
the mole
ducked into a hole
taffy barked
and began to
dig
dirt
flew everywhere
scott went home
he
wished a bo
he wished the bone
and showed it
to his parents
they were surprised
this
is a s
special one
this is a special bone
is very
heavy said his father
i think
it
is
a fossil it
is a bone that has been under ground for
millions of years and has turned into a rock
wow
a fossil
a real fossil
scott
was excited
asked
maybe my fossil is a bone
from a real
desert scott thought
that
that night scott dreamed
of
huge deserts
two days later scott carried the fossil to the museum

irene lewis
a
plass
paleontologist was
waiting for the class
she led them into a room filled
with skeletons of dinosaurs
do i read here or here
the children looked at the dinosaur
one by one
then scott knock
the skeleton of a
knocked a s
knocked

he looked at the
two bones then

dr lewis
smiled

but
what did
it look
like
he
how tall was it
what did it eat
what is

one question at a time said
dr lewis first
the
had

was flat like
the
a duck's bill
duckbills or
duckbill dinosaurs
san
second the
tailbone
you found
is a was lar large
it
came from
an
adult <unk>
this dinosaur was
over ten million
minutes long or about
ten meters long or about
as long as a bus
finally
duckbill dinosaurs lived in
herds
and
ate plants like
clouds
do you know
do i read here or here
here ok
that's
really big said
scott
he thought about
the
t
rucks
taffy made in the meadow
that dinosaur
foot
was much bigger
than a dog's
dr lewis smiled
suddenly scott looked worried
dr lewis
are there more bones or
any
truck
track
by the
new road
will
the dump trucks destroy them
do i read this part
no said dr lewis they will
wait for
then
they will wait for us to look for fossils
then they will
f
finish the road
you may find
the rest
of your
duckbill
you
children can watch and
scott you must
bring taffy along
best dinosaur hunter of all
uhm scott uhm goes to uhm some place that uhm is going he's going along for a walk uhm he doesn't know where his dog is and then a friend tells him where his dog is he's digging by the new road and then he goes over and uhm gets his dog and also finds the fossil bone
and then he comes back about t he dreams of uhm a some
sil
i forget what what he's dreaming of uhm but about two days later uhm he goes and uhm
<br>
with his class he goes to the museum and shows his fossilized bone to the museum uhm person and then uhm
<br>
the uhm the uhm the museum person uhm uh tells him it's part of a duck billed uhm dinosaur so then uhm the class is supposed to look for uhm more dinosaur bones
pete
s pete started into the pin forests
of the
georgia
georgia mountains
mountains the land didn't seem as beautiful now as he had
as it had earlier
he picked up a sack
and poke
poked at
the
camp campfire pete's father was hurt
he was lying on the ground with his broken leg wrapped in cloth

wouldn't have fallen off there were
their were
few towns
and no doctors on the georgia mountain and
seventeen sixty five
pete had his father

or plant pet
wanted to be
flower hunter too
son i want you to
look carefully
at every flower pete's father had said on an
earlier trip some
plants don't have flowers pete had
answered
you're right his father
had said there are trees
the
there tree doesn't have flowers that is
that is a con
fir on
conifer
is that the word
conifer
or
con breaking plant
it has hard brown
cones
th
like pin cones said pete
like pine cones
yes
do you know what
your cones have
inside them asked his father
pete opened a cone
seeds ha he said
fa
father do you
plant
do all plants have seeds
most plants do
they are
divide
dived into two groups
one is
flowering plant
the other is cone bearing
flowering plants have seeds inside fruits
cone bearing plants have seeds inside cones
on
hunting trips
pete had discovered
the two kinds of flowering plants plants
he one kind
have flowers with groups of three petals
one kind m <unk> has flowers groups of three
pellets
<unk>
<unk> have
flowers with groups of
four or five pellets
if was for
it was fun looking
at all those
plants pete
heard his father call
this
was no time for gazing
into
campfires
peter
come here please
i think my leg is infected
i have a bad fever
his father said
into a tired voice
you must help me son
some plants can
help me get well
bring me
me willow bark
bark
<unk>
<unk>
were pine
snap
f my leg
club
club moss too
club moss too
if you can
please hurry pete was afraid
could he find the right
plants
he would have to try
he hurried off into the woods
and he
and was easy to find
the willow bark
willows were long skinny leaves
and
growing by the river
pete
pete liked the
sharp smell
he stripped off some bark and put on the
on an
his pouch
finding pine snap was easy too
pine trees were
smell smelled their green needles then
pete picked up lump
of sap
from the bark
tiny club moss plants grew under the
pines
they looked
like
toys
toy trees
pete remembered that club moss was notice
spores
inside of seeds
he
shook the plant
over a small jar
soon the jar was full of spores
now pete started to
hunt for
b
bon
he screeched every he searched everywhere
he was getting
hungry his feet hurt and
scratch
covered his arms
finally he found
a few plants that look
that looked right but how could
he be sure
he thought ba
to the lessons about plants
pete's father had told
him that
a good botanist careful
ly checks a plant
the plants
fruit leaves stems
and roots
to find each
kind of plant
his father always reminded pete that
there
was
a lot to know about plants
thing
thinking again
of the lesson his father had given him pete felt sad
would his father be all right pete knew
he must find
the right plant his father
his father's life depends on it
what he had learned
was ex
he expanded the plant
he thought
but
he thought might be
he had
the right kind of small white flowers
the leaves were
the leaves were
up
sight
opposite each other on the
stem too
each leaf had a
burton right
across from it
for
one la
test pete dug up it the plant
and looked at the roots
the roots
the
the root was
fat and bumpy the bumpy
actually
right for p
as pete left the cleaning
clearing
he saw a bush with some
thing white on it he
he went closer to the bush
pete had shiny green leaves some leaves that were turning red
and he had a large white flowers
pete had never seen anything so pretty
father will like this he thought
he knew better than to touch
a strange plant but
he suddenly it
cl
s suddenly it close
closely
it
sly
than to touch a strange plant
but he suddenly it close
ly then
it reached to camp
pete showed his father the plants
he had found
he told him about the strange plant with
white flowers too
yes those are the right plants son
his father smiled
but where did you find the plant
where
plant with
that wh the white flowers
i'll show you when you're feeling better said pete
good said his father
pete billowed some water
a cup he put them
put the willow bark
in the water to make tea
after letting the
it set
for a while pete
pete father drank the tea
pete
put
the pine snap and club moss
spores and
on his father's leg
then pete's father slept
for hours
when he woke up pete
spores had the pine snap were helping infect the leg heal
peter can you help me make a crutch
asked his father
then you
then i won't
then i w
want you to take me
me to
to see that plant with his white flowers
it's in clearing by the river
pete
pete explained the
they hiked
to the clearing pete's father
s
s
pete's father stood
the plant
you've made an excellent discovery he
said we'll take some
cuttings from the plant
and then
you can name it
i think
well
i think we should name
it for the friend ben franklin
he likes science
i'll
he likes to have a plant
named for him
that's a fine idea
that's a fine idea his father
aided
added
looking at him proudly
and pete you're going to be a great flower hunter
end
well uhm his father went hunt went flower hunting with his mule and a bear came and the mule got scared of the bear and ran aw and ran off
and the father fell off the horse and broke his leg uhm he uhm h he uhm told his son peter that his uhm leg was broken
sil
peter felt really sad about his father
sil
and his father got really sick while his broken leg was there and he thought his broken uhm leg was infected
and he wanted peter to act to act like a flower hunter and find him some things to make him feel plants to make him feel better and he finds and he finds lots of plants for his father and find uhm a really uhm a really nice bush plant that has white flowers
and so when he g gets home he puts the some things on his some plants on his broken leg and and made him some tea
sil
tea and uhm his father felt much better after a a nice nap for like a few hours and then uhm his father asked pete to uhm show him where that strange bush with white flowers was were was so and his father told him
sil
uhm to uhm if he wanted to help him make a crutch so he could walk
and when they find the bush th they were thinking what they should name it since pete found it s and pete uhm uhm thought about the president uhm
sil
uhm ben ben franklin if he if he uhm
sil
m as
a puppy
was very dirty so his
owners named him fleabag
he soon learned that whenever his owner said
fleabag came he would sometimes get a yummy
bag
that was a long time ago when
was a puppy he was older now and had problems with
his back
legs
that made him
limp
when he ran
but that didn't stop him from running
like most dogs he loved to run
there was a dog park near where he lived he enjoyed playing with the other dogs because he didn't
have to be on his leash at the dog park
there was one dog named snot
that would always come up to fleabag and bite
his back leg and run away saying bark bark bark
bark
which in dog talk means you're are s too slow to catch me with your limp
so i'm going to pick up
on
your
fleabag
would always fleabag
would always chase snot but could never catch him
one day fleabag went to the vet
fleabag didn't mind the v
vet because unusually the people in the white
coats
gave him a treat
ts
fleabag
was at the v
vet
to have s surgery on his legs when he awoke
from the surgery he didn't remember where he was but he sure did want to see his owners soon they came and picked
him up and drove him home
fleabag suddenly realized that his legs
itched very badly he thought
oh
he thought
oh boy i'm going to lick my leg so hard that the itching is going to go away so he turned his head around
to lick his legs but there was a big white
thing in his way
he was wearing a collar that made it impossible to lick
its legs then it legs
the next day he
was walking with his
owners on his leash and they went to
the dog park
his owners wouldn't let
fleabag play without the leash since he still
needed to
he
heal but
it always it was nice
to see all his friends mean old snot
said bark
bark
bark bark
which means in dog talk why do you have to wear my stupid looking collar
boy
do you look silly in that ugly collar ha ha
ha ha ha
eventually
fleabag got to take
the collar
off but
by then
the legs didn't itch so he didn't want to lick them for six weeks he could take walks
and go to the dog park but he
couldn't
be let off his leash when
which made him
a little mad at his owners one day he took a walk to the dog park and all his friends were there
as usual
very com
fairly
his owners reached around the bag
and took a
his leash off
fleabag didn't know what to do because he had been on his leash so long just then snot
bit him on the back leg and ran away
realize which meant he was
all
owed
all
allowed
it's cause the words are so small and my eyes are so small
he was allowed to run so
fleabag started running after snot
snot was
what
la
<unk> because he knew fleabag could never catch him
but suddenly he noticed that fleabag was catching up to him and before
he knew it fleabag ran into
him and knocked him down and said bark bark bark
which in dog talk means don't you ever miss
miss with me again snot fleabag was able to run faster than he could ever remember
he was so happy that he could run fast
that
he sprained s
s
s
it's hard to
it's hard to s
sprinted
to his owners and gave them a
gave them big kisses
he uhm this dog snot always kept chewing on his leg and then his legs were so weak that he had to go to the vet and then he didn't remember how his life was again
and then he then then they went to the park and he wanted to just be running around alot and then uhm he just was angry at his owners cause he didn't get to and then the next day when he came he saw all his friends at the park and the same dog bit his leg again

owners
when his owners got him as a puppy
all he wanted to do was run run so his owners named him racer
when
when he got older
he he developed problems with his back legs every time he ran
and would limp
but that didn't stop him from running because
h like
he like most dogs racer loved to run
there were
a dog
there was a dog in
in a park near where he lived
he enjoyed playing at the dog park because he didn't have to
be on his leash when he was there
there
so he could run as much as he liked
there's as was one dog at the park named fang
he would always
come up to racer and bite his back legs and run away saying bark bark bark bark which which in dog talk
meant you are too slow to catch me
with that limp of yours so i'm going to pick on you
racer always chased fang but he could never catch him
one day racer went to the vet
racer liked t the vet
liked the vet because people in white
costumes gave him treats but racer didn't
s but racer didn't racer didn't know it but he was at the vet to
to have surgery to fix his legs
when he woke up from his surgery he didn't even remember where he was but soon his owners came and drove him home
on the day home <unk>
it
on a big
on the drive home
racer realized his legs itched very badly
he thought oh boy i'm going to lick my leg so hard that the itching is going to go away so he turned his head around to lick his legs but there was a big white
thing in his way
how
how was where
he was wearing
a
collar that made it impossible to lick his legs
a few days later he went to the owners
he went with his owners to the dog put
dog park
racers had
had to be on a leash since he still need to heal
from his surgery but it was nice to see all his friends
mean old fang said bark bark bark bark which meant
why
which meant
why do you have
have
have to wear that stupid
looking collar
sure
does
sure does look silly
eventually
racer didn't have to wear
the collar but by then his legs didn't itch
so he didn't want to lick them for six we weeks
racer would take walks and
go to the dog park
and
but he still
had
to be on a leash
one day he took
a walk
through the dog park as his friends were
there
as usual
then his owners reached out around
out around his neck
and took off his leash
just then fang bit him on the back leg and ran away
ran away racer's owners
just then fang bit bit him on the back leg and ran away
oh another typo
so racer's owners
said go run
so racer started running and chasing fang
fang was laughing because he knew
knew racer could never catch him but suddenly he noticed that racer was catching up
racer was catching up to him
racer was running
faster than he ever
remember and before
he knew it he caught
up to fang and knocked him down
racer said bark bark and which in
dog talk means don't
pick on me any more fang
and from that day on fang never bit racer's legs and racer was
so happy that he could run fast
that
he
ran and ran in circles
finally
he ran back to his owners and gave them big kisses for fixing his legs
racer uh pretty much he hurt his legs
sil
so
sil
he needed them to be fixed
sil
and he got them fixed so he chased after fang
sil
because he needed them he needed to get back at fang
sil
for chasing him

her mother looked over her shoulder she pointed to a place called
this is where we'll put our rafts
in the water
she said
she moved her hand down
the
rio
grande river
then she stopped at this
then and this
is
rock slide what is a rock slide asked
laurel
it's a surprise of the trip mom answered with a smile we've got to pack our clothes and pick up some fresh fruit
for uncle don uncle don was laurel's favorite uncle this year
he promised to
take them on one of his river trips
and his lighter
letter uncle
lighter uncle don said we must carefully measure the weight of rafts to be
heavy
he waits us he wants us to fill our
big color
fruit and ice
ice we'll measure everything in pounds because that's how we'll buy the fruit
he said the
he said the
filled color can't weigh more than seventy five seventy two pounds are color
weighs thirty pounds
three two
what are plastic bottles
with water
and
free stem each one with weigh four pounds that means we can bring
thirty pounds of fruit
that means we can bring th thirty pounds
of fruit said
laurel
ex
ex
<unk>
now let's estimate the weight of some fruit and make
a shopping list on one way to the store
laurel wrote her a list fourteen apples fourteen oranges twenty bananas two
m mellons two pineapples and two
bunches of grapes
at the store laurel and her mom carefully weighed
the fruit on the list
it weighed thirty four pounds
that is a pretty good estimate mom said
y
yes but
i'd
better take off some fruit
the next day everyone met
at <unk>
at <unk>
quickly they
inflated the rafts and put them in the water
laurel watched uncle dan load the raft with
supplies
cooking gear
duffle bags and big plastic jugs
what's in this in the jugs
asked laurel what are uncle dan answered and summer
people need lots of water each day
laurel was surprised uncle dan had measured everything carefully before the trip
she was
glad to
glad that they
had been so careful with
the fruit each
br
each person
put on a
life jacket
laurel's
mass
was thirty nine kilograms
she could were
wear a
junior sized jacket
laurel rode an uncle
dan's raft
she climbed on top of the duffle bags
and watched uncle dan pull
his
oars through the water
then she looked
into the river how deep is the
rio grande she asked
spread the texas map out on the dining room table
at the green patch
on the left
and read the words big bend this is big

national
her mother looked over her shoulder
she pointed to a place called
this
where we'll
our rafts in the water she said she
the
left her mother
rock slide
what is rock slide asked our

laurel started
laurel stared at the ripples
it's shallow she said i can see little rocks on the bottom
right now watch the
leaf float through the
rapids said uncle dan the water is faster too laurel added
you're right again we are going to ride any big rapids asked laurel
no until rock slide uncle don smiled
early the
afternoon
early in the afternoon uncle dan
dis
decided to stop
and camp
why are we stopping now laurel asked
listen whispered uncle don above the splashing
laurel could hear a
faint roar
that's rock slide uncle dan said
much
mysteriously
uncle dan said
<unk>
we'll
we'll need plenty of daylight when
we reach it
we'll also have to
repack the rafts very carefully
laurel listened to
the roar
the she wondered how the rock slide could make sure a sound
a sound
it took a long time for her
to fall asleep that night
the next morning
everyone got on the rafts laurel you ride with your mother today said uncle dan
laurel looked at the rafts the food chests and water jugs were almost empty
the rafts seemed much higher
in the water uncle don is making
in the water uncle don is making his
raft longer
she thought
i bet
i
bet it's shallow at rock slide
and they turned the next
it's
bend
in the river laurel saw an
other rafts
resting on the bank
and
river
had disappeared into the mountain of rocks
she had one
singing
thought rock slide
uncle don climbed the rocks over
looking
rock slide everyone followed laurel
looked down into the canyon there
the lazy
rio grande turned into fast
fierce rapids uncle dan told everyone how to travel
through the rapids stay close to the s
sides of the cliffs he said laurel
at the water was
at the water it was darker
near the cliff sides it must be
deeper there she thought
soon laurel
huddled in the middle of
a s
speeding raft
all around her water rode as
it crashed over rocks
paddles pulled through the water rafts
bounced off the cannon walls
water poured
in when laurel's boat leaned against the rocks she gasped
as the raft turned and tossed
at last she the raft reached the canyon floor
a tired happy group of
a narrow beach inside
inside
ellen canyon
they had survived rock slide but laurel had learned
something too she le
learned
that
a safe trip
has nothing to do with luck
you must
carefully plan
and measure your load if you want to measure
the ro
the rio grande ro
grande at rock slide
uhm it's about a girl who
sil
rides a br a boat with his with her o uncle dan and they have to have a certain amount of weight on the raft
uhm they rode on a river and uhm they went through s uhm s something called rock slide and they had survived it
uhm
sil
she learned that
sil
it's
sil
a safe trip not that's not uhm luck
before roos before i tell you how rooster john
got his name you should know a little bit about the town of franksville franksville was a town that seemed to have no problem after the other
their problems were started when they ran out of water thankfully someone was digging a hole and found water
but soon after they started to get fly
fleas
flies they got tons and tons of flies then the flies stopped but just then a man moved to town who played the flute so badly that people would run away screaming
maybe a poorly played flute doesn't sound that bad but it just
just try to imagine someone scratching a chalkboard with a fork
and then multiply
that times a hundred
that's how the flute sounded
when this guy played it i'm serious still it's not as bad as millions of flies i suppose
the bad flute player was rooster john he wasn't called rooster john yet that came later he was the new town dentist he was an excellent dentist
but
his real love was music he played many musical instruments such as the guitar the tuba the piano
and the clarinet how however for some reason
this way his mouth was shaped
made this flute sound awful
we can't let you play the flute anymore john
the police chief
chief sanders
the neighbors are complaining and the cats and dogs are trying to chew off their ears but i have to play
i was born to do it i don't know why but i feel like i have to or else bad things will happen
look john i've heard you play the clarinet you're quite good why don't you play that instead said chief sanders oh that's a nice instrument but it's not the flute
i
even wrote you a song chief sanders it's called cops and robbers then he played the song the police chief hated the sound so much that he threw john in jail
what they couldn't keep john in jail since he was really s since he wasn't really breaking any laws so
there was nothing the police could do besides everybody loved john since he had become the town dentist everybody's teeth were much whiter and cleaner
and no one had cavities so there was a problem in the little town of franksville what should they do they couldn't keep john in jail
and they didn't want to kick him out of town because
they all had such nice teeth so
so they decided that john could play the flute and everybody else would have to wear earplugs well i'm sure you guessed that
didn't work no one could hear
anything people were getting in
into car accidents and everybody looked really silly at dances dancing to the music they couldn't hear
they just couldn't lead a normal life then they decided to lower him down
a well and let him play down where no one could hear him john thought
that was an ok idea but there was an echo in the well that made his flute sound louder windows were breaking and all the cows in town started to make sour milk
the local scientist dr wong came
what up with an idea he thought that if he made a new mouthpiece especially shaped for
john's mouth then perhaps he could play the flute normally
and guess what it worked dr wong was the town hero the flute sounded normal and it turned out john could play it quite well people in the town decided to have a big
a great big parade in franksville to celebrate the fact that for once there was no water problem no fly pr problem no flute
problem
dr wong and john were the stars of the parade
they were up on the main float
and big band
a big band played as they marched up and
and down main street everyone cheered suddenly a fly landed on a little girl then a fly landed on someone else
then someone landed on some landed on a bunch of people
then pretty soon tons of flies were landing on everyone before they knew it the town was filled with flies again oh no the chief sanders it's just when
things were going good for franksville
john didn't know what to do so just kept on playing his flute the flies were annoying so it would swat them
with his hand or even his new flute he started shaking the flute to get his flies
and accidentally smashed it into pieces he was very upset at first then he said oh well good thing i brought my old
flute
as back up
folk
heard the noise they couldn't even swat the flies anymore
they had to cover their ears from the horrible sound the flies
would land all over the people and they couldn't swat them off it was gross suddenly the flies flew away as fast as they could dr wong for the second pronounced
it's the flute sound the flies hate john's flute playing as much as we do john is the dentist is driving the flies away
f
it was then that the people of franksville realized they would have to take the good with the bad because
as bad as the flute sounded it was a lot better than a thousand of flies crawling on them
from then on john would wake up at sunrise
like a rooster and played
and play to keep the flies away
should i press end
sil
uhm there were lots of flies uhm when somebody found water and then
came along and uhm
<br>
he and he played the uhm flute so bad that all the flies hated the music and so they left and uhm when they left uh when the flies left the townspeople were happy but they still didn't like the music so they tried so uh mister wong made uhm a uhm new flute a new mouth piece for the flute for the for rooster and for the guy and then uhm when he played it
uhm the i think that the flies liked it and then so then they came back and they didn't like the other noise so when the other guy when the guy played so then they left
wow that is really weird
victor
weird
asked yes
victor garcia said to his mother and his friend tommy
it sure is
said tommy
it looks like a space creature
that spider is no space creature but she is dangerous
said
mr foster
the park ranger
what kind of spider is she asked victor
black widow mr foster answered
let's go boys said mrs
garcia
i'm sure mr foster has many other
interesting things to show us
mr foster enjoyed taking summer visitors
through the visitors center at state
it the state park
as they walked through the center he told
victor and tommy a story about a super spider
that spun giant webs and tricked bigger animals
now victor was more curious than ever about spiders
i've
got just the book for you victor mr foster said
it is called spider from a to z
it is a good book to bring on a
spider hunt
mr foster smiled
hey would you like to go on a spider hunt tomorrow oh yes victor said tommy sh
shouted
something happened
like
sly hunters they sneaked through the tall wet grass
soon victor
spotted a funnel shaped web in the grass
in the center of the web sat a spider
you'd better watch out victor tommy warned
it might be a black widow mr foster smiled
why don't you check in the book to see what kind of spider it is
you don't want to touch an animal or plant until you know it's harmless
tommy and victor studied the spider book
it's a funnel weaver
victor said at last
not a black widow
black widows don't make webs like this
very good said mr foster
funnel weavers are n
non poisonous
the boys and mr f
foster watched the spider for several minutes
then mr foster had to leave
as soon as mr foster left
victor got an idea
quick he said to tommy
run back to the house
mom dad victor shouted when they arrived
i found a spider in the grass
may i keep it
i want to watch it to see how it lives
it's a ho
it's a
hold on said dad
where will you keep it
in my old aquarium victor replied
ok victor said mr garcia a spider will be fun to watch but you must take care of it and feed it
the boys went with mr garcia
to the barn
and found the aquarium
they covered the bottom
with
moss grass and stones
they covered the top
with a wire screen then the boys returned to the
orchard to capture the spider
victor carried the spider
to the house in a shoebox
then he carefully
tipped the box over and the spider fell softly onto the
moss inside the aquarium
you know what
tommy
victor said i think i'll call my spider
clarence clarence the spider
super spider
a week later victor saw clarence guarding a curious round object
hidden between some stones victor look at it through his hands
through his hand lens
what is this he wondered
victor
searched through his spider book until he found a picture of something that looked
like the object clarence was guarding
by
comparing its shape and size
to the picture
victor discovered that it was an egg sac
the book explained that the sac from a
after a female spider mates
my spider must
have mated with a male spider before i found her thought victor
i
have to show this to tommy and tell him my spider
is not a clarence it's a clara
when victor returned with tommy he saw
clara
clinging the egg sac
clinging egg sac the boys waited and
but clara didn't move tommy looked closer
oh no victor
i think she's dead
the boys waited but clara didn't move
tommy looked closer
oh no victor i think she's
dead
the book said the spider would be die after it laid
its egg sac
victor said sadly
but i hope
d
it wouldn't happen to clara
i guess
since she's dead we should make
sh we should take the aquarium back to the barn
winter came and
passed
one spring day
victor was searching for
a waiting
a watering can in the barn
he glanced sadly to clara's cage that
he and tommy
had left there last fall
clara's web
covered with
hundreds of tiny white
beads
and the beads were moving
the beds were moving
victor ran to the house grabbed his
hand lens
and returned to the barn
when he looked
through the hand lens he saw that the
beds were
shaped like spiders
the baby spiders have hatched from the egg sac
said victor i'd better tell tommy
a week passed victor learned from the spider book that the spiders had grown big enough to take care of themselves
he also knew that he had to do
what he had to do
he picked the aquarium and carried it outside
he removed the screen from the top of the aquarium so the spiders could leave
goodbye little spiders he said
it's time for you to start
a new life somewhere else
when victor came home from school the next day
he ran straight to the barn
the little spiders had gone victor sadly walked back to the house
victor you did the right thing
mrs garcia said
you made a
proper home for
clara and took very good care of her
and now you have given her children a chance to make homes their own
and have more spiders victor smiled to himself
he thought about last summer's spider hunt
and about clara's egg sac
he had learned a lot about spiders since then
uhm he found a spider and the spider had babies and she died
sil
uhm and mister foster i think was uhm someone who was showing them about uhm the spiders so he wanted to go on a spider hunt
mr gray lived next door

it was the first day of summer vacation sue and billy were eating breakfast what can we do today billy asked
i don't know about today but i have an idea for tomorrow said sue we can go to the zoo
but
the zoo is far away said billy
who will take us
i don't
mean the zoo in the city
said sue we can make our own zoo
in the in the yard all our friends bring their pets
what a great idea said billy
we can have balloons peanuts and lemonade
it it will be lots of fun
i'll call grandpa said sue
he worked at th he worked at the zoo he can help us make our zoo look just like the real z one
billy ran to the door i'll tell everybody to bring their pets here tomorrow
later that day grandpa came to to the kids he brought tools wood and paint he also had some wire to make cages
he found sue and billy in the yard they were deciding where to put the animals we can't put sam's goldfish
goldfish next to ann's cat said sue you're right billy agreed cats like to eat fish
cats and fish do not belong next to each other
you need a plan for your zoo said grandpa
billy thought about the city zoo different kinds of animals were different
were in different areas we need to put the animals in groups grandpa nodded
he picked up the some wood he made
five signs on each he painted one word when he was done his signs said birds mammals fish
amphibians
reptiles
should i press next
wings and beaks they also lay eggs said sue my parakeet
and nancy's chicken can go in the same group
that's good thinking said grandpa
what about animal mammals billy asked a cat is a mammal grandpa said so mammals have hair or fur said sue
and they don't lay eggs the babies grow in the mother's mother's body body
said billy
that's what happened when our cat had kittens
our cat fed her kitten milk
from her own body said sue added sue
dogs must be mammals too said billy and horses and lions and horses and lions
grandpa smiled that's right and her and there are peoples
and al
and so are people sue s
and billy were surprised to find out they were mammals too
the next sign
said fish sam's goldfish ha
have scales they have gills to breathe in
water
most baby fish come from eggs billy added ok said sue but where do we put juan's frog
the first
when he first caught it it was a tadpole
that lived in water
yeah billy exclaimed and now it can hop
on land or swim in a pond like
that kind of animal is an amphibian grandpa said
the
babies hatch from eggs in the water like fish do
when they get older they can li live on land
so go juan's frog will get go near the sign that says amphibians said sue
calvin doesn't have a pet said billy he is going to draw a picture of his favorite animal the whale
should it go with the fish grandpa shook his head a whale is a strange animal it lives in the water like fish
but it is really a mammal sue nodded
i saw a movie about whales baby whales come from their mother's body not from eggs and mother whales nurse their babies in water
they also breathe with lungs like like we do said grandpa
but they don't have hair or fur reptiles read
read billy a snake is a reptile so reptiles are animal with no fur ring wings wings or feathers said sue or gills added grandpa added grandpa
and scales
crocodile
uh crocodiles turtles and lizards
are some
other reptiles said grandpa reptiles have short legs like turtles
or no legs at all the snakes most
most reptiles lay eggs the bird
like birds fish and amphibians do
i know who i'll bring a reptile shouted sue ellen has a grass snake great said billy the three set to work making cages for the animals billy smiled at grandpa do you know the best thing about
our zoo grandpa shook his head
no
what billy at the end of the day all animals get to go home
should i press end
well they want to make they want they want to see a zoo but they don't want to go all the way to the city so uhm and make their own zoo in the backyard and they want everyone they know to bring their pet so so they want to put them in special places so then the animals won't get eaten or anything
and uhm and they wanted it to be like a regular zoo cause most of them are separated by like groups and uhm and so the best part about this story about the end about the zoo was because they got to go back home

he ran around in the grass poked his nose into everything and looked a all around he saw a shiny acorn in the grass it was such a nice acorn i will take it home he said so he put out his paw to touch it but the little acorn ra rolled away from him he ran after it
but it kept rolling he was a came to a big oak tree with roots all over the ground then it rolled under a big round root
l little mr field mouse ran ac ran across to the root and poked his nose at the acorn he saw a small hole on the ground he went in it and saw some stairs going down in the earth
he went in and saw some stairs going down in the earth the uhm acorn was rolling down so he went down too down down down down rolled the acorn and down down down down went to the went little f went the field mouse he saw a tiny door at the foot of the stairs the t sh the shiny acorn rolled to the door and hit it with a tap
the little door opened and the acorn rolled inside field mouse went fast down the stairs and into the door it was shut and it was it shut and he was in a little room and there was funny little red man he had a little red cap and a little red coat and little red shoes with po which points at the toe
you are in my jail he said to the field mouse why said the field mouse because you tried to take my acorn said little red man it's my acorn i found it said the field mouse no it is not said the little red man i have it you will never see it again the little field mouse looked at the room but he couldn't see it didn't see any acorn he wanted to go back up the tiny stairs to his own home but the little door was locked and little red man had the key and he said to the mouse you will be mine you will make my bed and clean my room and cook my food
so little brown mouse made the little reds man bed and cleaned little red man's room and cooked the little red man's food and every day little red man went away t t out the tiny door and did not come back until afternoon but he always locked the door after him and took the key at last one day was in such a hurry that he turned the key before the door was shut
the door did not lock at all he went away
then th the little field mouse knew he could that he could run away home but he did not want to go without the pretty acorn he did not know where it was he looked everywhere he i like your computer
he looked everywhere he looked in the every little drawer but it was there was nothing there he looked in every closet but it was but he could not find it then he got up on a chair and opened a teeny teeny
teeny tiny door in the wall there it was he took it in his paws then he took it in his mouth then he ran away up t up

new york to texas
without my parents
i was

pretty
nervous
i
i guess

and
i didn't know
any
an any one
i stared
thinking
we must
s
s
miss
k
sh might crash
i
didn't like to
think about that but
i couldn't help
it
that's when
i
missed my parents
the most but once
the plane was in a
air
in the air i was
p
pretty good
how do you click it
you just press both of them
my mom gave me a
c
coloring book of
cool
cool looking dinosaurs
to keep
keep me
busy
i colored the
drawing
p
t
the dragon
picture
all
green
so
it
didn't take
very long
i only used
the green
crayon
because
it
was the t
s tallest
and the widest
and i wanted to
it to
change
c
catch
up to the
red
brown blue yellow
purple and black ones
one
one
thing about
drawing
t
drawing
by
yourself on
an
airplane
is that
that
the f
s
el a little boy i don't know if it's a little boy or a little girl
<br>
they went on an airplane by themselves and they're going from new york to texas i think and the mom gave the little boy a a coloring book and he colored it all green
because you are so pretty
said the big
the big round sun and the little white rose
and the little white
rose blushed
she turned pink
after that all her children were
were little pink roses
uhm a long time ago there were just white roses and when the sun stared at a little white rose uhm
sil
he said you are so beautiful so the rose blushed and when she had children the children were pink
ok
maria was proud of the plan she had drawn
she had everything signed her name at the bottom
but she still needed some advance from her cousin france
france was an engineer she'd know the best to build the clubhouse
france was staying at the
in an earthquake
do you like it maria asked
as francine speared out the plan on the kitchen table
is the plan okay
where should my friends
and i build our clubhouse
one question at a time france laughed you have a good plan but the walls should be
the walls should be made
of two not bricks but dad and i dug up the bricks for the old patio
they're still good maria explained it's great to reuse materials francine said but bricks can fall on you during an earthquake
we haven't had an earthquake here for a long time mr ruiz said as he came into the kitchen so why worry
you don't have to worry but i believe people should be prepared
france said earthquakes can have done a lot of
damage in some parts of the california
will there ever be an earthquake near our ranch maria asked
we don't know
for sure france said our studies show that there has been some
minor seismic activity near here
what's seismic activity maria asked during more most earthquakes rock
deep inside the earth moves the
and breaks apart
when the broken rock sha shakes it sends out a vibrations that move
the earth this vibration is called seismic waves it's like dropping a stone in a pool of water
maria nodded the stone splashes and and wave go out in
a circle she said
right france said sometimes the earth rolls up and down the earthquake is strong enough it can cause buildings to fall apart but you can make some buildings almost earthquake proof
how maria asked first you need to find a place to build on that's first
you need to find a place to build on that's solid
like that area by the barn there's probably granite deep
under the dirt there
firm in an earthquake
put a brace here and there hey i have an idea mr ruiz looked over france shoulder you can build the clubhouse on that square of
of concrete near the barn
we used to have a shed there
when the wood rotten
i tore it down that's great france said
the building can be
braced on the concrete thanks dad
and thanks for your help france maria said
i'm going to find my friends and tell them we we'll start building tomorrow
one maria's friends bought a s
<unk> wood
of for the sides of their building another brought a piece of canvas for the roof when the end of the week the clubhouse was nearly finished
good choice for the roof france said one afternoon as she checked out their progress
<unk> are lightweight so it won't hurt anyone if there's an earthquake last job was to make a sign maria had just finished when carl
oh
her cat streaked past calico scrammed up a pile of bricks jumped onto the clubhouse and
disappeared over the other side maria shook her head
calico had never acted like this then maria felt the ground shake she looked over toward the barn the barn bell was ringing by itself maria couldn't believe what was happening maria could not move
father walked to her side are you ok france she ran toward him we just had had an earthquake it was very strong but a few dishes fell on the shelves she said
i ducked over the table so i'd be safe i'm glad you two were out in the open nothing could fall on you
it was ok only a rock and roll mr ruiz
france nodded animals may feel movement deep in the earth before we can feel it but we can't depend on them we have to learn what to do
when an earthquake strikes right maria said with a smile
like building an earthquake proof clubhouse
<br> well there's this girl and she decided to build a clubhouse and then her cousin uhm said there might be an earthquake so they use this material some kind of material that i don't remember what it's called but uhm well well uhm they study about earthquake and suddenly uhm a shake was happening and and uhm the bell was ringing by itself and s i don't remember who hid under the table but someone did

marie was a proud
was
of the plan she had drawn
she had even signed her name at the bottom
but she still needed some
advice from her cousin francine
francine
was an engineer she'd
she'd
know the best place to build the
clubhouse
francine was
staying at
the ruiz ranch
while she
s
studied
earthquakes
she was also studying how
to build
build
dings buildings
that would not fall down in the
earthquake
do you like it
maria asked
as francine
<unk>
<unk> out
the plan on the kitchen table
sh she is the plan okay
where should my
friends
and i build the clubhouse one question at a time
francine laughed
you have a good plan
but the
walls should be made of wood not bricks
but dad and i dug
up the bricks from the
old
patio
they're still good
maria explained
it's great to
<unk>
m
<unk>
<unk>
<unk>
<unk>
francine said but bricks can fall
on
fall
on
you during at
an earthquake
we haven't had an earthquake
here for a long time mr ruiz said
as the as he came into the kitchen
so why worry
you don't have to worry but believe people should
be prepared francine said
earthquakes
have done
a lot
of damage in some parts of
california
wi will there ever be an earthquake near our ranch maria asked
we don't know for sure said
francine said
your studies show
that there it h has been some
minor s
seis seismic
activity near here
what's
seismic
activity maria asked during
most earthquakes rock
rock deep
<unk>
rock deep inside the earth move
moves
and breaks apart
when
the broken rocks shake
it sends
out vibrations that move the earth
these vibrations
are called
seismic waves
it's like dropping stone in a pool
of water
maria nodded
the stone splash
it and waves go out
in the circle
she said
right francine said
sometimes the earth rolls up and down
if an earthquake is strong enough it can
cause
buildings to fall apart
but you can make some buildings almost
earthquake proof
how maria asked
first you need to
find a place
to build on
that's solid like
that
area by the
barn
there's probably
<unk> deep under
the dirt there there's probably
hard rock
it usually stays
in firm in the earthquake
francine picked
up a pencil and quickly made a
sketch
when you build
you should use wood and put a
brace
here
and here
h hey
i have an idea mr ruiz looked over
francine's shoulder
you can build
the clubhouse on
that square of concrete
near the barn
we
used
to have
a shed there
when the wood rotted
i tore
it down
that's great francine said
the building
can be braced on the
concrete
concrete
thanks
dad
and thanks for your help
francine maria said
i'm going to find my friends
and tell them we'll start building tomorrow
one of maria's friends
bought
sturdy wood for the sides of their building
another bought a piece
of
canvas for the roof
by the end
of the week the clubhouse was near finished
good choice
for
the roof francine said
one afternoon as she checked on their progress
canvas
is
lightweight so it won't hurt anyone if
there's an earthquake
the last job was to make
a sign
maria had just finished when
ca
calico her cats
leaked
past calico can
scampered up
a pile of
bricks jumped onto the clubhouse
and
dis
disappeared over the other side
maria
shook her head
calico had never acted like this
then maria felt the ground shake
she looked over toward the barn
the f
f farm
bell was ringing by
itself
maria couldn't
believe what has happened for
a minute maria could not move her
father
walked over
to her side
are you okay francine
are you okay francine
ran toward them
we just had an earthquake
it wasn't very strong
but it
but
a few
dishes fell off the
shelves she said
i ducked under the table
so i'd be safe
i'm glad
you two were out in the open
nothing could
fall on you
oh it
was only a little rock
and roll mr
ruiz tried
to smile
did you know
this earthquake was coming
in unfortunately no francine said
however there were a a few signs like more
seismic
seismic activity
and today the chickens were acting
strangely too
calico
too maria remembered
francine nodded
animals may feel
movement deep in the earth before
we can feel it
but we can't
depend on them
we have to learn
what
to do when an earthquake
strikes
right maria said with a smile
like building an earthquake
proof clubhouse
sil
uhm they were building a clubhouse and their cat ran over the roof of their clubhouse and then a little tiny earthquake came and and uhm made him move and so they couldn't move because they were so scared for a second
sil
i don't know what else
things were acting kind of weird the next day
yeah
okay
the monday ruth learned back
back in the warm grass
she could
suddenly th a door slammed
doc is home ruth said jumping up s to her feet
doc bell lived it next door
doc
doc
doc liked to
ride in balloons
doc took her
big balloon to
the park her friends always helped her
her fill the balloon with air
then to heat the air so
so the balloon would rise
doc climbed into a
large basket tied to the balloon then the balloon would lift doc high towards the clouds
ruth found
doc by her garage garage
she was looking
at her big thermometer
ruth
knew that the thermometer measured the temperature of the air
as th the air
warms the
red liquid in the grass
tube
glass tube
rose
rises
as the air cools the red liquid in th
in the tube falls
balloons are hard to fly doc
s said doc
you need the right kind of weather
she looked at the sky
let's see what the clouds
tell u us about the weather
ruth
ruth
laughed
how can the clouds tell us anything
doc
doc pointed to the fluffy white cloud in the sky
clouds in the sky
those are
cum
cumulus clouds
they tell us
that fair weather is here fair weather is
balloon weather
said doc
ruth smiled
they look like balls of cotton
doc showed ruth the pictures of other
kinds of clouds
cur
cirrus
clouds high in the sky are thin white
curly te they tell me that the weather might change in about a day
no cumulus
clouds mean it nice or
said ruth
a third
kind of cloud took
took look f for it's
sa
sat
<unk>
sat
uhm
s stratus said doc
it's a thick low cloud that covers the sky
fog in stratus clouds cloud near the ground
what
are clouds made of ru asked ruth clouds are made of thin drops of water or bits of ice doc explained
i have an idea she sudden
sa she said suddenly you watch the clouds
this week
when
the weather is right we'll go for a balloon ride
ruth asked her parents if she could go
and
they said yes
she could couldn't wait the next morning ruth saw fog the sky was filled with thick low clouds stratus
s she said stratus clouds she said
no balloon ride today
on wednesday the sun was shining ruth dressed
in
a rush and ran
it to find doc she opened the back door
flapping in the wind
she thought about being blown across the sky in a big balloon
i ca i can see why balloonists
don't go up in the wind
she thought
it wasn't balloon weather after all
early thursday morning ruth called doc
there is
there's no rain or wind the weather is just right
there are only
few
cumulus clouds in the sky
you
you're right ruth said doc
let's go
at the park ruth watched
the big orange balloon fill with air
it got bigger and bigger
the balloon looked at
like
the balloon looked like a big pumpkin t to ruth it's a pumpkin balloon she s shouted
doc helped
her climb into the basket doc's friends
untied the ropes slowly the balloon ro
ruth's
ruth's eyes got very big
i feel just like a bird
the pumpkin balloon
floated over to the l
to the land
it floated above ruth's school
it floated above mrs hill's flag
it was s so nice to be high up t up high
but in
but in less than a an hour the wind began to blow
we'd better land
now
said doc
ruth didn't mind
she had
a great time soon the big pumpkin balloon was back on the ground thank you
very much a doc said ruth
sure replied doc
i like having company
would you like to go up in the balloon again
oh yes said ruth
what a good
day it had been
now ruth would watch the sky every day she
could hardly
wait for a clear blue sky
or some cum cumulus
clouds without any wind
then
then
it would be time for another
ride in the balloon pumpkin
the ruth was ruth and doc were talking about different kinds of clouds and uhm doc as told ruth if she watched the sky to uhm for this week she could go up in a ride in the balloon
and uhm ruth got got to go into the balloon and then some it started to it started the wind started to blow and doc said we better land now and it was the best day one of the best days for ruth
do i read out loud loud
bryan and judy bryan and judy ann were best friends
they lived next door to each a
each other in small town west of new orleans
louisiana
a creek ran behind their house
at night judy ann and bryan could hear the sounds
sounds of the frogs and insects that lived near the creek
one saturday judy ann and bryan were riding
their bi
their bicycles
they were crossing the bridge over the creek when suddenly bryan stopped
what's up
asked judy ann
there's there's something down in the creek see
see it
see it looks like there's a bumpy old log
the they both jumped back when they lo when the log when the log splashed and dragged itself up the bank wow
i'll see
i've seen the alligators before but but never this close bryan said
sure enough a big alligator was resting on the bank of the creek
it was black black and tan
its wet bumpy hide shone shone in the sun then it crawled back in into the muddy water
only its head still showed
i don't want that alligator getting cassie my cat my cat declared judy ann
maybe we can help it get back in where it belongs
ok let's go
go get my dad said bryan
mr
de <unk> listened to the children's breathing n n news
what do we do asked bryan let's call the fire department said judy ann
now this a good idea
now that's a good idea answered mr
degas
mr degas
deal
deal dialed the emergency number and explained
explained the alligator to the about the alligator
call call dr bob thomas said the fireman said the fireman said
he's at the louisiana nature the science center
dr thomas is a scientist he knows all
all about
reptiles
soon dr thomas arrived in a in a truck that had wildlife rescue painted on it
the truck pulled a trailer with a boat bryan and judy ann looked up looked up at donor at dr thomas
he was very t tall
he smiled through the curly brown and gray be
beard
come se come see the alligator judy ann
cried
an invaded our our neighborhood said bryan
dr thomas laughed alligators live here long before people did that
you might say we in
invaded its neighborhood
dr thomas explained
that was going to catch the alligator and take it to a place far away from where people live
he took a long pole out of his truck
the pole had loops
on each end
to
i use these to catch the alligator he said the handle is the handle is square to keep the pole from twisting while i use it
why is why is one loop bigger than the other asked judy ann
because alligators come in different sizes
sizes
answered dr thomas
alligators can run for a short distance but they can't run fast so why don't you stand
stand a little father away if you want to watch continued dr thomas as he walked down the toward the animal
what do alligators eat bryan asked well dr thomas answered
grown alligators may eat just about anything
but usually they eat fish frogs turtles and snakes
i i'll
bet
it's waiting for a lunch right now said bryan usually dr thomas
explained when a alligator wants to eat
it waits quietly in the water
until something comes back
then the alligator snaps it
snaps up
its meal and tosses it down its throat
to
close down on its prey
but once the jaws are shut
it can easily hold them close
otherwise it would be t too dangerous to catch it by by hand
i would use
i would have to use a trap
dr thomas took some some big black rubber bands from his pocket
see those bands he asked
dr thomas pulled
pulled on a high black boots
he he
eased
eased to himself to gent
gently
gently into the creek's brown water
slowly now don't send waves to the warn
to the warn
the alligator
then the animal turned his dark i
eyes toward dr thomas
toward dr thomas and tried to dive
as it struggled fiercely to get away
the loop closed tightly around its neck
dr thomas pulled the alligator to the surface
and dragged it t to the shore
there was able
there he was able to sit on the alligator
he tied up
his front front and back legs
now
he quickly pulled
a back black rubber band from its pocket
finally the alligator grew too tired to struggle
dr thomas had captured the alligator
now it was time to put the alligator in the boat and bring it to a new
home deep in the swamp
dr thomas would find a place where would be far from people
bryan and judy ann bryan and judy ann looked at the alligator
then they looked at each other
they had heard plenty of alligator stories from their parents and grandparents now they had a tale from their own
there
there to tell
uhm brian and judy ann were uhm bike they were riding riding their bikes to this kind of like a kind of like a creek and they saw a big log but then they recognized it was no ordinary log it was really an alligator so they called uhm
sil
it was either or judyann's or brian's dad and then the dad called doctor thomas i think and then doctor thomas uhm e uhm talked to them something about alligators and uhm went in the water and got the alligator

scott

taffy liked to

<unk>
taffy liked to
dig in the dirt i
know where taffy is
he threw
wait he thought he is digging
where are
they are building the new road
scott
raced past the
dump trucks
he saw taffy
crashing
a
mole
the mole duck
in
into the hole taffy
broke
broke
and
began to dig
dirt
dirt follow
everywhere
i went walking i
i did

i went walking what did you see
i saw a black cat looking at me
i went walking what did you see
i saw a brown horse looking at me
i went walking what did you see
i saw a red cow looking at me

i saw a green duck looking at
i went walking what did you
i saw a
pink pig looking at me
i went walking what did i see
i saw a yellow dog looking
i walking what did you s what did i s
i saw a lot of animals following me
this boy was walking and he saw these animals looking at him and at the end he saw all the animals that were looking at him were following him
do i start here or here
taffy taffy where are you cried scott
scott knew that taffy liked to dig in the dirt i know where taffy is he thought
he is digging where you are building your new road scott raced past the dump tracks trucks
he saw taffy chasing a mole
the mole ducked into a hole
taffy barked
and began to dig
dirt flew everywhere
taffy and scott were lost in in a cloud of dust
when the dust settled the mole was gone
then scott was the bone
look taffy
you found a bone scott cried
but taffy didn't care
he didn't even mind where when scott took the bone
scott had a had a feeling
that
there was something special about this bone
scott went home he was he washed the bone and sh showed
it to his parents
they were surprised this is a special bone it is very heavy said his father i think it is a fossil
it is a bone that it has been under ground for millions of years and has turned into rock
wow a fossil
a real fossil scott was excited
his mother said
why don't you take the fossil on your trip to the science museum
you can show it to a
i can't say that word
paleontologist
what's a paleontologist said asked scott
paleontologists are science
scientists who are study fossils
they work to understand what life on earth was l like millions of years ago
maybe my fossil is a bone from a real dinosaur scott thought
that night scott dreamed of huge dinosaurs two days later scott carried
the fossil to the museum
dr irene lewis a paleontologist was waiting for the the class
she led them
dr lewis carefully opened scott's paper bag
she took out the fossil
she looked surprised
and excited
where did you find this she asked
scott answered
my dog taffy dug dug it up near the new new road
she asked them to to help her find out which dinosaur it came from
they all wanted to help very much
look at each dinosaur
try to match the toe bone sh
she said
scott looked at the first the feet of the huge
uh
these toe bones are too big he decided how about
it has to huge teeth and pointed toe bones said scott's friend julie
no this toe bone is square
answered scott
the children looked at the dinosaurs one by one
then scott
noticed the skeleton of the of a
h
then he shouted
here it is this is my dinosaur
dr lewis smiled
you're right scott
you're right scott
wow said scott
but
what did it look
like how tall was it
what did it eat wa
eat was it friendly he asked
wait wait
asked
like a duck bill
also called duckbills
or duckbill dinosaurs
second the toe bone you found is large
it came from an adult
this dinosaur was over ten meters long
or about as long as a bus
finally duckbill the dinosaurs lived in herds and
ate plants like cows
do now
imagine a whole herd of
of
dinosaurs all as big as a bus
scott gasped
the
come all over here and i'll show show you another kind of fossil said dr lewis
dr lewis showed them a giant footprint
of in a rock
this is was made by a large dinosaur called
<unk>
<unk> or whatever
that's really big said scott
he thought about the tracks
taffy made in tra ta tracks taffy made in the mud
dr lewis smiled suddenly scott looked worried
dr lewis are dr lewis are there more bones or any tracks by the
new road
will the dump trucks destroy them
no said dr lewis
they will wait for us to look f for fossils then they will finish the road
we may find
the rest of your duckbill a you children can watch and s scott

his father said in
a tired voice
you must help me son
some plants can help me get well

willow bark
club m
most too
too if you can
please hurry
pete was afraid could he find the right plants
he would have to try
he hurried off into the woods
it was easy to find the wil
low willow bark
willow willows with long skinny leaves were growing by the river
pete
liked their sharp smell
he s
stripped
off some bark and put it in his pouch
finding pine sap was easy too
pine trees stood all around him
he saw their prickly cones and smaller then green needles
pete picked
lumps of sap from the bark
tiny club moss plants
plants grew under the
pines they look
like toy trees pete remembered that club moss
is
it has spore
spores
instead of seeds he shook
the plant over a small jar
soon the jar was full of spores
now pete started to hunt for the
he searched everywhere he was getting hungry
his feet
hurt and
scratched
all over his arms finally he found a few plants that look
right
but how could he be sure
he thought
back to
his
lessons about plants pete
pete's father had took him
that a taught him that a good
the petals fruit leaves stems and root
roots to find each kind of plant
his father always reminded reminded pete
that there was a lot to know about plants
thinking again of the lessons his father had given him pete felt sad
would his father be all right pete picked
pete knew he must
find the right plant
his father
he his father's life
depended on
what he had learned
he
minded examined
a plant he thought might be
bon
it had the right kind of small white flowers the leaves were
opposite
each
other on the stems too
each leaf had
a pattern right across
from it
for one last test pete dug up the plant and looked at the root
as pete left the clean
clearing he saw a bush with something white on it
he went closer the bush had shiny green leaves
some leaves were turning red
it had large white flowers pete had never seen anything so pretty
father will like
this
he thought
he knew better than
to touch the strange plant but he
s
d studied
it closely
then he returned to camp
pete showed his father the plants he had found
he told him about the strange plant with the white flowers too
yes these are the right plants son his father smiled
but where did you find that plant with the white flowers
i'll show you when you are feeling better said pete
good said his father
pete
boiled some water in a cup
he put the
willow bark and the
after letting it sit for a while pete's father
drank the tea
pete put the pine sap and club
moss
spores in
on his father's leg then pete's father slept for hours when he awoke pete's father felt much better
his fever go away
the club moss s
pores and the pine sap were helping his
infect
sh
infected le leg heal

his father

you've made an excellent discovery he said
we'll
we'll take some cuttings
from this plant
and you can name it
i think we should name it for your friend ben franklin

that's a fine idea
his father added looking at him proudly and pete you're going to be a great flower hunter

hickory dickory dock the mouse ran up the clock
the clock struck one the mouse ran down hickory dickory dock
inside the hollow wall of the house way up near the roof
there lived a family of mice
wait
it was a snug home
it was it was nice and quiet
and as dark as any mouse could ever want
mamma mouse liked it
the wind that
came through the roof made it cool and
summer wait
and they were ear
to the chimney to keep
of <unk> in the family
there were three children
named hickory
and dickory and dock
there
there had once been a papa mouse as well but he died
while he was hunting for food one night he saw a nice piece of cheese in a box and tried to get it when
he stuck his head into
box it closed with a snap
wait i need to get a tissue
when mama mouse came down
when mama mouse came down to look for him he was dead
mama mouse was sad to be all alone
she felt that people were mean to kill
a poor mouse because he wanted to get food for himself and his family
mice can't earn money like people do so they have to live by stealing food
mamma mouse was brave
was a brave mouse and he knew that it was her job to find food for her children
so she dried her eyes and went to work chewing through the board
between the kitchen and the wall
it took time to do this because she could only work at night
mice like to sleep during the day and work at night
at night there are no people around to bug them
and
even cats sleep some mice run
about in the day but they are not very smart
at last mamma mouse chewed through a hole in the board big enough for her to get through into the kitchen
but she was sad to find the bread covered with a pan
how mean wait how mean people are to put things where a hungry mouse cannot get to them said mamma mouse with a sigh
but just then she saw a barrel
of
flour on the floor
that made her happy
she knew she could easily chew through that
and they could eat the flour instead of bread
it was now almost morning mamma mouse decided t
to leave the
attack on the floor flour barrel on the next for the next night
she took a few crumbs that were on the floor for her children and ran
and ran back into the wall
up to her nest
hickory dickory and dock were very glad to get the crumbs because they were hungry
would they
had eaten they all curled up with their mother
and slept all day
be good children said mamma mouse the next night just getting ready for her journey
to the kitchen don't come out of our nest till i come back
after tonight
will not be hungry for a long time
i will chew a hole in the back of the flour barrel
where it will not be found
she kissed each one
good bye and ran down the wall when they were left alone
hickory wanted to go to sleep again but little dock was wide awake
he jumped around in the nest so much that his brothers could not sleep
i wish i could go with mother
some night said dock it's dock it's no fun to stay here
all the time she will take us when we are big enough said dickory
we are big enough now said dock and if i knew my way i would go
out into the world and see what it looks like
i knew
i know a way out said hickory but mamma wouldn't like it if
it if we went out without her
she doesn't have to know said
the bad dock
oh yes said hickory well said hickory i'd like to take a stroll myself
but you must promise to be careful and not get into trouble
i'll take you through the hole that i found
so the three little mice started off
with hickory showing the way soon they came to a crack in the wall
hickory stuck his head through
he saw that all was quiet the family of people
that lived in the house was fast asleep
so
he went
through the crack and his two brothers came after
their little heart beat
hearts
beat very fast because they knew if they were found they have to run for their lives
they crept over the thick carpet until they came to some stairs
what shall we do now said hickory asked his brothers
let's go down s said dock so they went down the stairs to the hall
of the house very carefully
they were surprised by what they saw
there was a big wall for hats
and coats a bucket for umbrellas two very pretty chairs and best of all a tall clock that stood
on the floor and
ticked out the minutes loud and strong voice
what is it
said dickory very quietly i don't know said hickory he was afraid t
afraid it's
it s is it alive asked dock
i don't know said hickory again then they saw the clock didn't notice the
but kept ticking away so they got
their courage up and ran about suddenly dickory gave
a yell that made his brothers come running
there in a corner lay almost half of
the little girl of the family had
it was a great find for the three mice
they ate until the last crumb was gone
and they were fat and happy
this better
this is better than the kitchen said dock they had finished their supper and i bet
and i bet there are plenty more good things around if we look for them
but they couldn't find more all the doors in the hall were closed
dock went to the clock
he found nothing except a hole inside of
the clock
<unk>
dock could hear the ticking
louder than even now he looked he looked way up on the top of the clock and saw something bright
he thought it must be good to even <unk> he
if you could only get to it without saying anything to his brothers dock ran up
side to the clock
until he came to the gears
he was just bright
to bite
a shiny wheel to see what
it was one o'clock the clock
the clock
the clock was just telling the time but the bell just beside docks ear
had always her
the little mouse
he screamed with fear and ran to the <unk> as fast as he could go
when he got to the hall he heard his brother's running up the stairs he ran after them as fast as he could
only when they were safe
in their nest again did
they stop to breath they were so scared that their little heartbeat
fast for it
that their little hearts
beat
fast for an hour
mamma came back in the morning she brought some nice flour with her for breakfast she told her
they told her about their adventure
she thought
they had been punished enough already
for not listening to her so she did not scold them
she only said you see my dears
your mother knew best when she told you not leave the nest
children sometimes think that
that their parents that
more than their parents this adventure
should teach you always to listen to your mother
the next time you run away
it may
end worse than last night
after all remember what happened to your fath
father
but hickory and dickory and dock did not run away again
sil
s uhm well there were well there was a dad who died and there was a mom who had to get food every night and there were three mice
sil
named hickory dickory and dock and one night they ran away
sil
to see what it looked like in the house
sil
and they found food
sil
uhm
sil
from like a girl that lived at the house and it
sil
uhm
sil
was
sil
not very safe
sil
and they almost got scolded but they didn't
sil
and then they never ran away again
often told her that
her
imagination was
<unk> and someday
her wild stories would get her into trouble
this time however christi
was sure that there was something very mysterious going on
sh
spring vacation was always
exciting but
this one was more exciting than usual
christi was on an airplane for the very first time
she was going to
houston texas
houston texas to visit her
aunt and cousins
her
parents had been
so busy kissing and hugging
her to
her good bye
that they hadn't noticed the
very mysterious man who had
boarded the plane and was now sitting right next to her
christi
had never met anyone
in los angeles t
who
wore
wait
christi was sure that her imagination
this time
there was something mysterious about the man first of all he was wearing two watches
christi had never met anyone in los angeles to wore two watches and he couldn't think of a good reason anyone would
then there was a very
mysterious box he was carrying
on the
side
in the big red letters it said
n a c a
also he kept scribbling
things
christi had tried without success to see what the man was writing
after lunch the man pushed his seat back
and took a nap
christi took it the change to glance at the note pad it read
return moon by tuesday
now christi was sure that she was not something strange
return to the moon
n a s a
two watches
christi heard the pilot say that they were about
to land in houston
she put her things in to her backpack the plane landed
and
when the mysterious man left his seat christi noticed that he had dropped
a photograph
she looked at it
and saw that the man had already left
christi put the photograph in her pocket
pocket
aunt grace was waiting for christi
at the gate
christi ran and hugged her on the drive home christi told
aunt grace all about
her flight and the mysterious man who sat next to her on the airplane
when she remembered the photograph
and took it out of her pocket
the photograph showed two shiny gloves poking through
two
round holes and a glass
case
the glove fingers
held tweezers and that was lifting
tin de teensy dark stone
more mysteries thought christi at lunch christi told her story to the cousin mark and showed
him the photograph you can explain this she said
what do you think return the to the moon by tuesday means i don't know mark answered but this photograph looks very familiar
i know
it was in a
book
my mis sister has
you know that terry is training to be an astronaut
i'm sure i saw in one of her books
well
aunt grace said to mark and christi terry at the n a c s a
s
johnson
space center
she worked near the
l
lunar example exhibit
we can visit her this afternoon
maybe she can help you find an answer to the mystery
they found terry right away
first she showered then a large photograph of the first man on moon
nearby in the glass case the footprint pressed into the lunar sole
by an astronaut boot
it looked like the print of big tennis shoe
the sole looked like the dirty sand all together there were six
apollo missions or trips on the moon between nineteen sixty nine and nineteen seventy two
for each mission the spacecraft carried three astronauts
once the moon's
orbit astronaut stayed on the
command model while the
other two landed in the moon
in the lunar model
those two astronauts explored the surface and collected moon rocks
that is so special about moon rocks asked mark
well terry for one of these things rocks are very old about the same age
as the oldest rock on earth
by studying the moon rocks
and comparing them to earth rocks scientists learned about
how the moon formed and changed
over billions of years
when they each reached the second floor christi and
mark were amazed
they were looking at glass cases with two holes
in each hole
was an empty black rubber glove
like the one in the photograph a sign <unk> on a wall nearby
scientists use these cases and gloves to there examine rocks taken from the moon
there is no oxygen inside the case and the gloves are
worn to keep
the slices of moon rock pure
so much for your mystery said mark
it still is a mystery said christi it
was true that parts of it were cleaned up
the man on the plane had something to do with the
n a s a
and probably worked
with moon samples
but i still don't understand why anyone
would want to wear two watches
or
how
someone would return to the moon
it was time to go
aunt grace terry mark and christi were in the parking lot when christi saw a familiar face sir sir excuse me sir
christi yelled the man turned around
christi reached into her pocket i think you dropped this on the plane this morning
she
said hanging
him the photograph
why so i did
the man said smiling mr <unk>
is work for the n a s a carrying moon samples
to the
f to and from labs around the world
it was very upset when i found i'd lost a picture
i is there anything thing i can do for you thanks for returning it to he said
well said christi
would you please answer
two questions for me i'll try mr fujiwara smiled
could you tell me why you wear two watches
and what return from the moon by tuesday means mr fujiwara laughed i travel a lot of n c a i always wear two watches that tells me what time it is in tokyo where my family lives
then you
watches tells me what time
it is here
it is where
i'm
you
wouldn't want me to call my family in the middle of the night would you
return to the moon by tuesday was just a note i wrote to remind myself to take a piece of m of moon rock
to tokyo with me on tuesday
christi was a little disappointed
to the such
an ordinary explanation for everything
while the others talked to mr <unk> christi noticed a tall woman wearing a
raincoat and carrying a umbrella
why would anyone carry on a umbrella on such a
beautiful sunny day christi decided that something was mysterious going on
uhm he he went on a plane to see her grandma and grandpa and then she saw a mysterious man and sh she wanted to find out about him and then she he kept scribbling stuff on a piece of paper
and then
sil
the person that was on the plane driving it said that it's time to land and then uhm everybody got up and then he dropped the picture
and then she picked it up and then
sil
the mysterious man was gone so then she went out of the plane and met her grandma and grandpa
sil
and they went out in the parking lot
no they went out in the
sil
uhm airplane place and then they saw the mysterious man again and then they went over and asked the man questions and gave them the picture
laurel spread the texas map out
and
<unk>
wait
the dining room table she looked at the green patch
on the left and read the words big bend natural park
her mother looked over her shoulder she pointed
to a place called
this is where we'll put our
rafts
in the water in the water
she said
she moved her hand down the
the rio
grande river
then she stopped and
this is rock slide what
is rock slide asked laurel
he said i filled the
cooler can't weigh more than seventy two pounds
our cooler weighs thirty pounds
we can bill
three
three two
three two liter
litter plastic
bottles with water and freeze them in each one of
each one will weigh four pounds that means
we can bring thirty pounds of fruit
<unk>
<unk>
actually said mom now let's estimate the w
the weight of some fruit
and make a shopping list
on
on the way to the store
laurel wrote her list
fourteen apples fourteen oranges twenty bananas
two lem two mellons
two pineapples
and two
bunches
of grapes oh ok
at the store
laurel and her mom carefully weighed
the fruit
on the on the list
it weighed thirty four pounds
let's find out by estimating said the uncle d said uncle don
he pushed
an oar into the water
into the bottom
then
he pulled it out
compare the wet
part
of our
what
the ice chest the ice chest is about eighty pounds
about oh eighty
centimeters long
wow
the wet part
is about
twice as long
w that's only
one and
half
meters uncle
don looked worried the river
is low
it's going a
to be a rough trip rough rock slide what rock slide will <unk>
oh
uncle don smiled just wait you'll find s you'll find out soon
that
night they camped on the river bank
under the stars
in the morning the river looked
even lower
eat up laughed the uncle don the m the more
you eat
the lighter
the raft will
be when you catch a rock slide
laurel wondered what
rock slide could be
at
the paddled small
<unk>
<unk> ri rippled
in the distance why
do rapids look different then the rest of the river asked laurel
look at the water uncle don
what
different about the water
in the
rapids
laurel stared at the ripples it's shallow she said i can see a little rock on the bottom
right now watch the leaf float
through the <unk> the ra the rapids
said uncle don
the water is faster too laurel
added you're right again are we going to
ride the big
rap rapids asked laurel not until rock slide uncle don smiled early
in the afternoon uncle
don decided
to stop
and camp
why are we stopping now laurel asked listen whispered uncle don above
the splashing laurel
could hear the faint roar
splashing laurel could hear
a faint roar
that's rock slide
uncle
don said
mysteriously we'll need plenty of
daylight when
we reach it
i i'll also have
a repack the rafts very carefully
laurel
listened
to the roar she wondered
how
rock a rock slide
could make
such a sound it took
a long time for
for her to fall asleep that night
the next morning everyone got
on the rafts laurel
you ride with your
mother today said uncle don
laurel looked at the rafts
the food uncle don laurel looked
at the rafts
the food
the food chest
and water
jugs were almost empty
the rafts seemed much higher
in the water
uncle don it
t
is making his raft lighter
she thought i bet it's shallow at rock slide
as they turned
the next bend in the river laurel saw other rafts
resting on back of the
river and
he stared into a mountain of rocks
she had one
sinking thought rock slide
uncle don climbed the rocks
overlooking
rock slide everyone followed laurel looked down into
a can there was a lazy
rio
grande turned into fast
fierce rapids
uncle don told everyone how to travel thought
the the climbed said stay close to the
to the sides of the cliffs he said laurel looked
at the water it was darker near the cliff sides
it must be deeper she thought
soon lau laurel's
huddled
in the middle of the
speeding raft all around the water
roared as it
crashed over
the rocks
paddle paddles pulled through the water rafts
bounded off the
can walls the water poured in
poured in
when laurel's boat leaned against the rocks she gasped as the raft turned
and tossed
at last the <unk>
the raft
reached the can floor
<unk> happy group
happy group of
rested on the narrow beach
inside santa
on a can the
had served rock
slide but laurel
had learned something too she
learned that a safe trip
has nothing to do with luck
you
must carefully plan
and measure your load if you want
to master rio grande at rock slide
ok well they went on a trip to rock slide and
<br>
i don't know i didn't the water was getting lower and the next morning they had to like they had to eat more food so it wouldn't be so like like i don't know
sil
i don't know like it would be lighter to hold so they could make it to rock slide
sil
and
sil
i think when they got to rock slide like they hit rocks and everything but they made it
sil
and that's all i can remember
wow that's one a that one is really weird factor
grace said to his mother
and his friend tommy
it sure is said tommy
it looks like a space creature that spider is not space creature but she is
back window mister frosty answered let's go boys said mister <unk> i'm sure mister frosty has many other interesting
things to show us mister for frosty enjoyed talking summer
<unk> thought
he mis the <unk> center
the state park
as the walk as they walked through the center
he told that <unk> and tommy a story about a s
super spider
that sounds <unk> great
that sounds <unk> webs and ta
ticket bigger animals now <unk> was more
<unk> then ever about spiders
i've got just the book for you victor s mister f forest said it's called spiders from a
to z it
like
shy hunters they sneaked through the tall
wet grass
soon victor stopped
a <unk> cheek
web in the grass
in the center of the web sat a spider
you'd
better watch out victor tommy warned
it might be a black widow <unk> smiled
why don't you
<unk> in the
book check in the book
to see what kind of spider it it is
you don't want to touch an animal or plant
then
<unk> you know it's
harmless
in tommy and victor s suddenly the the spider book
studied the spider book
it was finally where leave <unk> said at last not
a black widow black widows don't make webs like this very good
said mr for
funnel
where's on no
pictures the boys mister frosty watched the spider for several minutes then mr
foster's had to leave
in soon a mr
in soon as mr foster left victor got an idea
quick he said to tommy
run back to the house
mom dad
victor shouted
when they
ventured i found a spider
in the grass may i keep it i want to watch it to s see i want to watch it
to see how it lives it's a s
it's a hold on said dad
where will you keep it
in my old
aquarium
victor s replied ok victor said mr <unk> a spider will be fun to watch but you must take care of it and feed it
the boys went with mr <unk> to the barn and found the aquarium
the
they covered the bottom with moss grass and store in s
satin
that covered
the top with
a wear screen
the
they then the boys
returned to the
orchard <unk> to capture the spider victor s cried the spider to the house in a
shoebox then he
carefully
tipped the box over and the spider fell out softly onto the
moss inside the aquarium
you
know the what tommy victor said i think
i'll call my spider
<unk>
salamander the super spider
a week later victor saw <unk> growing a chorus road object hidden
between some stones victors looked at it
through his hand eyes
what is this he wondered victors
searched through his spider book until he found a picture of something that looked like the object center peter was grilling
by comparing its shape a and size
to the picture victor discovered that
it was an a sac the book
explained that the
size from forms after a female spider mates
my spider must have mated with a male
spider before i found her
thought victor said
i
have to show this to tommy and tell him my spider is not a found her
when victor said returned with tommy he saw
clara
clinging that it
the sac the boys waited but clara
didn't move tommy looked
closer oh no victor said i think she's die the book said the spider is would die after
it laid
it's a sac victor said said sadly but
i
hoped it
wouldn't happen to clara i guess
since she's die
we should take the aquarium back to
the barn he
winter came and passed one spring day
she's was
since searching for a watering
for a winter came and the barn

next to each other
you need a plan for your zoo said grandpa billy
thought about the city zoo different kinds of animal were in different areas
we need to put the animal in groups grandpa nodded he picked up some wood

and
amphibians

and billy's like great so then they had like the whole zoo ready
the blue ribbon season
clint took his special box he kept his favorite things in that box
what there was the
arrow arrowhead
he found
in a field
there was a beautiful golden shell and key chain from the zoo
his father had won at
the
county fair when he was a boy clint wished he could win a blue ribbon just like his dad did
this
this summer i'll get the change he thought
if clint could think of a project his farm club just might win
the family garden ready for spring planting
clint always helped her he loved to dig in the dirt
and plant seeds the best part
was watching the seeds sprout
as clint worked in the garden he got a great idea why don't i try to grow something all by myself
i could enter what i grow as my project for the farm club
clint went to look for his father he found him working in the barn dad can i talk to you for a minute clint asked sure clint said his father what can i do for you
well
do you remember the blue ribbon ribbon you won at the fair
i really want to win one said clint
i was thinking maybe i could grow something all by myself enter
the f
to enter the fair
i wondered what
kinds of seeds i could plant
finished clint
so
get the seed basket take a look at what's in there said dad whatever seeds you choose
i'll be glad to help
clint looked at the seed packets at the bottom of the basket
was a packet marked sweet corn
when clint saw those words he could
almost taste the wonderful corn
this is it dad i'm going to grow sweet corn
blue ribbon sweet corn
dad smiled
to see clint so excited you'd better read the directions dad said growing
good corn takes a lot of work clint read the direction
on the directions on the seed packet
plant sweet corn in early may
get the ground ready for planting
plant the seeds in a sunny spot
plant seeds in straight rows
water the seeds
once a week
of it
does not rain
the corn should be fully grown in eighty five days
i think i can do it dad said clint good siad dad
today is may f first so you better start now
you can use the small plot
your mother
garden
by your mother's garden to plant your crop that afternoon clint planted the corn seeds in four neat rows
spring turned into summer the days past quickly
when it didn't rain clint remembered to water his corn soon the green shoots were
growing tall and straight slowly
long leaves grew out of
the stock
by july plants were as tall as clint
one day dad and clint stood out by corn plant
it's time to watch for
top
on top of the cornstalk
called
pol
of corn
the wind helps
corn pollen
fall over the plant
clint looked at his corn plant how does pollen help
the plant strings of
corn silk <unk>
out of each corn husk
these strings
catch the pollen said dad
they
take it
in to a the
cob
where the kernels will grow
there is one string of corn
skill for each kernel
when the pollen reaches the cob
the kernels begin to grow
every day clint checked
his plants for tassels he wondered if the wind would blow enough
pollen for the corn silk
one afternoon clint found
his dad in the fields dad he said
i'm worried that not enough pollen will fall on the corn silk
well said dad sometimes the wind doesn't blow enough
pollen
onto the silk
then the farmer has to help
you want your corn to be especially good
maybe you should think up a way to sprinkle the pollen
on the silk yourself
clint took
clint thought and thought finally he looked at some of his parents farming
magazines
an hour later clint ran to his corn plant he found a way to spread the pollen
first
he pulled
next he held the
bag shut
and
shut at
the bottom carefully he bent
the pollen would not spill out of the bag
then he shook the plant the pollen
soon the silk and husks of each plant were covered with pollen
it was long hard work but
clint was happy
he had solved the problem just like a real farmer over the next few weeks the corn grew quickly clint worked
in his rows every day
finally he marked off the last of the eighty five days
that morning he picked
three ears of corn these
ears are the best he said
i'll enter the
them in the fair
when the fair was over clint came home and took out his special box he smiled and he laid a new blue ribbon next to his
father's now there were two blue ribbons in the family
uhm he want clint wanted to enter the contest so
he
asked his dad what he should do and
his dad
gave him an idea of planting something
and
he looked in the plant thing
the feed
basket and found sweet corn and he planted it first he read the directions then he planted it and did what the directions said and he
uhm entered the contest and won another blue ribbon
those cows are too hard to catch said hungry lion
they are never a far apart and when i get near them they turn their tails to one another and point their long sharp horns at me
they even walk down to the river together when they are thirsty
if i could catch one of them by himself i could not
be hungry
but one of the
cows had a fight
the best grass is over in the valley said one cow let's go there
i don't like the grass there said another
it is better on the hill
i want to spend the day there
i hate climbing the hill said the third cow
i you like grass right here
i don't like any of those places said the fourth cow come and
come with me and
i will find you the best grass you ever had
i am going to the valley said the first cow
you three can do what you want
and i will go
to the hill said the second cow
i think you are
mean not to go with me
and i will stay right here
you may all be sorry
if you go
the lion may
catch you said the third cow
i am not afraid of the lion said the fourth cow
if none of you will go with me i'll go by myself to eat at a better
pasture pasture than any of you
can find
i am
older than you
and i know where the best grass grows you had better follow me
we will not s
do it said the other three cows
you're not the boss just because you are older
k
so the four cows went different ways
one went to the valley the lion
was down by the river and saw him coming he waited quietly until the cow's
cow was very
n near and jumped
then he looked around for the other cows
one was eating g grass on the hill the cow saw the lion coming
him coming and was scared he couldn't get away and
with only one set of horns he couldn't fight the lion got him too
the other two cows were far apart so it was easy
for the lion to jump them
also
and that is the way
cow's fight
ended
if they had stuck together the lion would
still be hungry
uhm
the lion no the cows were
are <unk>
uhm
and
uhm
and uhm they went to different places and they all got eaten by the lion
the brahmin tiger and the jackal
<unk> by
taylor <unk>
oh
do you know what is brahmin
a
brahmin is very great and gentle kind of a man
who lives in india and who treats all animals
as
if they were brothers there is more to
this is enough
for the story one day
a brahmin was talking
on
a country road
and he came upon a tiger shut
up a strong
acorn tree cage
the villagers had caught him to
shut him
up there
for beginning wick
oh brother brahmin brother brahmin
said the tiger please let me out
to get a little drink so i am
i am so thirsty and there is no water here
but
brother tiger and the brahmin
you know if i let you out you would jump on me and eat me up
never brother brahmin he said
never
in the world would
i do such
a bad thing just let me out and
minute
to the get a little little
drink of water please brother brahmin
so eat the brother unlocked the door and let the tiger out
the moment he was out he jumped on brahmin
and was about to eat him up but brother br but brother tiger said
the brahmin
you promised you would not
it
it was not fair for you to eat me when i set you free
it is perfectly right and i will eat you up said the tiger but the brahmin
a are gold
so hard that
at the last
at the last
a tiger eager to wait eager to wait
they would ask the first five people they met whether it was far
fair for him to eat the
brahmin
and if the decide if they decided
it was right the bra the bram br brahmin would let the tiger eat him
the first they came to
to to
ask
was an old brahmin tree
by by the road
a brahmin tree is a kind of of
fruit tree brother brahmin said to brahmin
eagerly does it have
<unk>
see it
does
it seem to right you right that this tiger should be should eat me
then when i set him free from his cage
the brahmin tree looked down at them and spoke in a
a tired voice
the summer
it in the summer he said
when the sun is hot
men come
and sit in the cool
of my shade and eat
the fruit of fruit of my branches
but when
evening comes
they leave the my leaves and th and throw stones at my branches for
for more fruit
men are ah
ungrateful
they let the tiger eat bra brahmin
the tiger sprang back
the tiger sprang to eat
the brahmin but the
branches said
wait wait we have
we have only ask
we have only
one
we have still four to ask
then they came
to the place where an old bull was lying on the road
the
brahmin brahmin
went up
to him and said brother
bull
oh brother bull does it seem
to you a far thing that
this tiger should eat me up after i just
i breed him from a cage
but
the bull looked up and said in a deep
grumbling voice when i was
young my s
strong
my master used me hard i served him well i carried heavy loads and carried them far
now
now that i m i am old and weak i cannot work
he leaves me without food or water
to die
men are
thankless let the tiger eat the brahmin
uh
the tiger jumped but the brahmin spoke very quickly oh but there is only w the second
but
is only the second
brother tiger you promised to ask five
the tiger grumbled
a good that dial deal
but at last
but at last he went
on again
with the brahmin af and after a
time time
they saw an eagle flying in the sky at
the brother
uhm the brahmin called up to him
oh brother eagle
brother eagle
tell us if it seems far that
this tiger should eat me up when i have just saved him from
a
from a
<unk> cage
the eagle soared slowly
overhead
a moment
then
we
he came
lower and spoke in a thin
cl <unk> voice
i live i live high in the air he said
and i do not man
men
any harm
yet
when men
find my babies they
they s they stone my young
they stone my young and rob my nest and shut
shut
at me with arrows
men are cruel let the tiger eat the brahmin
the tiger jumped in the brahmin
to eat him up
this
is
this
time
the brahmin had
had to work
very hard to keep him off at last
the tiger stopped
and the way walked and they walked on
together a little
in a little while they saw an old
alligator he was lying in mud and smile
at the river
edge
brother
brother alligator oh brother alligator said the brahmin
does it seem right to
this tiger wants to eat me up when i have just let him out of a cage
the angler told
turned in the mud
and grunted
and snorted
then he said i lie here in the mud all
day
as harmless as a bird
i hunt no man but every
pokes with me sharp stick men are worthless let the tiger eat the brahmin
as the tiger
tried to eat the brahmin at once
the poor brahmin had to remember him again and again
that
they had asked four
f only four wait till we've asked one more
wait until we see the fifth
he
begged finally the
the tiger walked
on with him after ti after time
they met a little
jackal
coming
happily down the road toward him them
the brother jackal
the br dear brother jackal
oh brother jackal dear brother jackal said the brahmin give us your opinion do you think
do you think it is fair
the ti this that this tiger should eat me
when
i set him free from a cage

it went this way i was ta i was wait i was walking along
and i saw the tiger oh dear dear said the j little jackal
i'll never

talk like that
with a long story if you
really want my opinion make it clear
what sort of
cage was it
why a big plain cage in
an iron one
said the brahmin
that gaze that gives me no idea at all said the little jackal
listened
listen my friends
if we are going to get to the bottom
of
this you'd better show

what it what

were you in
i stood here said the tiger
as
he jumped into the the cage with my head over my shoulder like this
oh thank you said

that the door
shut me in said the tiger
oh
i'm so sorry said the little jackal i know i'm very slow

how does it shut
it shuts like this said the brahmin pushing it shut yes but i don't see any lock
he said the jackal and said the little jackal does it
lock on
the outside it locks like this said brahmin and
he shut
and
bolted the door
oh does it really

that
is
that
it is locked
i think you sh

locked
as for
you my friend
he said
to the tiger i think you will wait a good while before
you'll find any one to let you out again
then he
bowed
to the tiger good bye brother he said
you go that way i'll
and i'll go this way way good bye
was uhm
this tiger and this man was just walking along and he found this tiger in a cage and so he let it out because he thought it w had to get a drink but really he wanted to eat him so they he let him out and they were about to eat him but
uhm he said in the ca when he was still in the cage that if uhm
if he would eat him up uhm he would ask five animals what their opinion was and yeah so they asked them all and then they found the little one the last one was the little jackal
and he said
uhm
he said that uhm
that they should
that they should just he just
those cows are too hard to catch said a hungry lion there are they are v n never far apart and when i get near them they turn their tails
to one another and p point their long sharp horns at me then they they they ever they even walk down to the river
together when they are t thirsty if i could catch one of them by himself
if i could catch one of them by himself
oh if i could catch one of them by myself i would not be hungry
but one day the cows had a fight the best grass is over in the valley said one said one cow let's go there i don't like th the i don't like the grass there said another it is better on the hill i want to spend the day there i hate climbing the hill said the third cow

well why not w well w i mean why do no why will not do it well we will not do it said the said the other three cows you're not the boss just because you're older
so the four cows went different ways one went to the valley the lion was down by the river and saw
him coming he waited quietly until the cow was very near and jumped then they then he looked around for the other cows one was eating grass on the hill
the cow saw the lion coming and was scared he couldn't get away and with only two set set of horns it was only one set of horns he couldn't fight the the lion got him too
the other
two cows were were far apart so it was easy for the lion to jump to to jump them also and that is the way the cow's fight ended if they had stuck together the lion would still be hungry
the gold in the orchard a farmer wh
if a farmer who had worked hard all his life was sick he knew that he would die soon he called his three sons to his bed to
give them some advice they were good sons but did not like farm work they wanted to make money fast my sons he said take good care of
the orchard do not sell it there is a part pot of
uhm dirt
no there is a pot of gold under the dirt do dig dig for it if you want
turn over turn over every foot of earth then turn it again and again the treasure is there
the sons tried to get him
to tried to get him to tell them where the gold was hidden he would not tell them after the farmer was gone the sons
went to work to find the the pot of gold they did not they did not know where the hiding place was they decided to begin in a line
one of the or
of the
uhm orchard and to dig until one of them found the money
they dug until they had turned up the soil from one end of the orchard to the other they dug around the th the the tree roots and between them but they found no
pot of gold they thought maybe someone had stolen it they thought maybe their father had gone crazy the three sons were
upset to have worked on nothing for nothing
gr grew more fruit than ever the gold the good work they had done digging brought the fruit it was so good that when it was sold
they got a whole pot of gold
the sons saw how much money had from had come from the orchard then they knew what the wise father had meant when he said there's a there is gold hidden in the orchard dig for it
there were this four cows and they never split apart so it was hard for the lion to catch them but when they split up then the lion caught them e really easily
and uhm
i forgot what i was going to say oh wait is this our school's or is this yours
uhm there was this sick uhm old farmer that was a racoon and he died and uhm the he said before he died there's a big pot of gold under the ground and uhm
uhm
there's a big pot of gold under the ground and dig it up when i die and uhm
uhm it uhm you'll get you'll you'll get to keep it and then he uhm
then he died and they and then they didn't find it but then they got really good olives and they got a whole pot of gold and they knew what they meant when their father said that

they're just not the same kinds of
sounds that you
same kind of
of sounds you want to hear in new york just listen
ramon
ramon listened he heard birds singing
he heard cowbells
ri
ri
ri
ring
ringing from the
ran he heard soft sound of the wind
t blowing trees
through the
through the trees blowing through the trees then they heard something strange
what's that asked rick
i don't know ramon looked at around the porch
he saw nothing but some empty bottles
i think the house is growling whispered ri
maybe it's the wind said ramon
the sound stops
when the wind stops
it starts when the wind blows
it's the house that's making the noise i don't
like it ramon said rita the wind blew
they heard the sound again
this time ram ramon knew what it was ramon
walked over to the empty bottles on the porch and
wrote <unk> heard he picked up a bottle
and
blew across the top
there
it was that strange sound
so that
what s been
making those
odd noises
said the
voice behind them
their
mother was standing
at the door
why does the bottle make the sound mom asked rita
she f
she felt silly
for thinking that
the house had groaned come inside
she
said their mother
we can talk while i work ramon and rita picked up the bottles and
followed their mother into the house
several boxes sat in the kitchen floor
mom
was talking
dish
taking dishes out of one box and putting them away
when you blew across the top of a bottle mom explained
the air inside and
the bottle
vibrates
what does vibrate mean asked ramon
well the air inside the bottle moves back and forth very quickly mom answered
these ramon
movements are called vibration
dad came into the room
look kids he said i can show you what vibration
m
are
he
held a rubber band in his hand
dad pulled the rubber band
tight back
behind two fingers
pull
the rubber band
h
rita
he said
and then l
it go
ramon watched
rita
pulled the rubber band
and let go of it it moved quickly
it
made a funny sound
did you see the rubber band vibrate
asked dad
it moved back and forth very fast and it made the air
around it move very fast the air moving back and forth those
movements are vibration
right asked ramon
and vibration the sound right asked
rita
mom smiled
you're both right she said
those vibrations move the
thought the air into our ears mom explained
our ears send
a message to our brain and that's how we hear sounds
rita picked up a bottle
it was short
shorter than the others she blew across the top of it
the the bottle made sounds like a whistle she said
that's right dad
said dad
a tall bottle makes the
makes
a deep sound there is more room inside for the air to vibrate
a shorter bottle makes a higher sound
it's less room for the air to vibrate dad and
ramon were
we have many size of bottles
will they all make different sounds let's try them said dad each bottle made a different sound i told you there
were lots of things to hear around here
here
he he
here joke
rita
then a new sound filled a the room it's thunder said mom
there is
there must be a storm
we've better shut down shut the windows
rita raced to close the windows dad closed the doors they finished just in time the wind started
blowing harder suddenly
the house really did begin to
everyone looked around
where
is that awful noise coming from asked mom
i never heard a sound
like that in new york
rita whispered
roam
m woman
was standing near the fireplace when
they heard a
groan again
i think it's coming from the fireplace he said
fireplace is making
that spooky sound
the wind
s slowed down for a moment the
the house quiet
the house
became quiet again
rita
began to laugh it's not spooky she said it's just the chimney
the chimney is like a giant bottle
when the wind blows over it the air inside vibrates
and because it's so tall it
makes really deep sound
the r ramon added
i think ramon and
rita right laughed mom as if to be prove the what they had said
the wind blew again
the house
groan
these two kids
uhm
had bottles outside and they were wondering what this noise was outside and then they found out that it was the when there was <unk> it makes noise and
and then they went back in and a thunderstorm happened and it started getting windy and
they uh
and they said they uhm thought it was like a giant model

jude was mad
he could hardly catch his breath
his body felt tired when he got home
his
<unk>
s slammed the door behind him
what's wrong
his big sister
ellen asked
what's going
there's going to be a big race drake is going to beat
me
he beats me at everything jude sa sadly
ellen had an idea why don't you try
for the race
how do i do that
jude asked <unk>
track picture tomorrow
you can talk to my coach
i'm sure
she'll
she can help you
said
ellen
if you want to be a better runner there
are three things you should know
she said first you should run for fifteen minutes every day
how will that help
asked jude when you run you use a lot of muscles in your body
ex except coach <unk> your muscles aren't used to running if you run a little every day
your muscles will get stronger muscles
that are ex
<unk> can work longer without getting tired
ok said jude what else can i do
in the race in a race
you can only
wait
want to be able to
run fa run and not get tired
you also want to run fast
and said coach <unk>
so the second thing you should do
is something s some
<unk>
you should do it every other day
do you know what spreading means
jude thought for a moment
he had never heard the word
before i don't think so
coach he said
pick a spot that is not too for far away
race to it as fast as you can
rest for a minute then race back
to why
your
where you standing
that's what sprinting means do you
that four minute
four times
s explained coach <unk>
and don't forget to warm up before you run
that is the third important thing
you should know
your sister can show you how
jude looked at
j
ellen
what does warm up mean he asked
warming up means doing
ex
pressed
elena said
you scratch your
muscles you stretch your muscles
muscles that haven't been s
get hurt it is always good to stretch before running ok big sister
show show me what to do said jude
for the next four weeks jude went
to the park every day trying
for the race was not easy sometimes he didn't feel like running
but he made himself do it
anyway he practiced just like the coach
and his sister had told him
to he always stretched his muscles before he ran
every other day jude w
wrote
worked on his speed
he would choose a tree not too far away
and race to it
he would rest
by counting to sixty then he would run back to where he started then he'd do it over again
each time he
practiced
of what it would be like
when
he beat drake in the big race
at first jude found it hard to run
he was
out of breath he could
feel his heart pounding on his chest
but as the days passed he ran
longer and
far farther without getting tired
his muscles got stronger
the
stronger he got the more
he could run he used his watch to
time himself
and he knew
he was getting faster he was happy
at how he was
doing he
now
when he ran his heart beat s
steadily
each every day
he wrote <unk> thing in my eye
every day he
wrote down in his notebook how much he had run
finally the day of the big race came everyone in school was in was at the track the runners lined up
to start drake turned to jude
and said i'm surprised that you'd even
you're even here
i'm the one who will win the this race jude
didn't say a thing
anything he was too busy warming up at last
the big moment came the perfect
the principal of the school called out on your mark get set go
the race was on as
quickly as they could drake and another runner
named beth
took the lead suddenly drake started to slow down
he was tired
and out of breath as they raced around the track
speed speeded past drake now beth was
the only runner ahead of jude
he
he
pa
p on the speed
but
so did beth
now jude understood why the coach had told him to practice
sprinting as the two runners
close
beth was a
the close second
jude
became as the principal placed
a medal around his neck he had run his very best
that day and he had
beaten drake
jude jude

it
was from aunt red wig
every since aunt
wig
had become to travel
she had put po
postcards
it for cassie in
mother's letters aunt red wig took people on trips all over the world
the postcards
she sent cassie always had a riddle about where she was
this postcard read cassie stood the r
riddle
i wonder how the
length
of
shadows can tell where
aunt wig
aunt red wig i think
i'll ask matt
cassie thought her brother matt was in high school he
worked after school at the
public library cassie
looked to visit
him there as she walked to the library cassie read
to the riddle over and over again
none
shadows were long the sun
sets soon where
is it c cold in the month of june
but
month of june
i had some ideas but she
i can't see that word
right there
wanted to ask matt a question
do i click this
high said matt when cassie came to his desk what's new hi said cassie look
at i
have another postcard from aunt red wig matt laughed
that means you have another riddle to figure out
yes i do cassie sh
shadows are the first clue to the riddle can you tell the
seasons but
that the length of shadows
you
cou
<unk>
we
can't said matt
he
reached for the lamp
on his desk look
on the floor cassie what
do you see when i hold the lamp like this cassie looked
on the floor
i see a short shadow
she said
but i don't see what it has to do with the seasons let's
pretend that this lamp is the sun and
said matt
when the light
sun from above the shadow
is short
during the summer the
the noon sun
is high in the sky and
shadows a is short
but
when i hold the lamp
at this angel
the shadow grows longer that's right said matt
when
i hold the lamp at
an angel
angle
like the noon sung is the in winter the shadows are longer
aunt
red wig is in a place where the noon shadows are long said cassie
since the noon sun is long
in winter it must be winter where aunt red wig is cassie
was proud of herself
that's right said matt
what's the next clue
the second clue is that the suns sets soon
cassie thought for a moment i
know the sun sets much
earlier in the winter aunt
it does
in the summer so that
also tells
tells us what it's winter
where aunt red wig is right again said matt
but
i haven't solved the riddle yet said cassie she looked at the globe on matt's desk
isn't this the equator she asked
pointing to the line around the middle of the globe that's right said matt well
said cassie people who live
south
of the equator have winter
starting in june and summer in january don't they that's true said matt if it
is winter in june
then
aunt red wig must be somewhere south of the equator cassie thought she looked
carefully at the globe aunt red wig could be the south america australia or maybe
somewhere in africa said
cassie maybe there's another clue said matt
what's
what is the picture on the card
it's some animal i don't
look too closely cassie turned the postcard over she laughed a koala bear

we make
cool shade on the green grass
said the flapping leaves
we
grass
the tree's in
fresh
and quiet green
it is bare
and brown with o
without us
tried people and hot animals are
happy for our shade children love to play under us
at night the song birds of
the woods fly to us for our safety
we
hide the nests of mother bird
s
the n light winds stay with us and play with us
and the leaves felt
very proud of
and important
what you say is all
very true but you should not forget us said
a voice from the earth
we are surely
war worth something
and who are you we're do you grow
asked
the leaves
we are deep in the ground far below
you but we feed
the st stems
and make you grow
we are your roots
and w
wa oh
your
bea
t
but
t
be te
to us
we are not
pretty like
you are but we do not die
winter does not change us but
when it comes you fall
a tree stands
firm we hold it
in place
if we did
did
the tree didn't
the tree would die and you would
die with it
uhm
the leaves were talking about their things and then the roots started talking about what they do
and they were sort of like bragging
about each other and then
the roots uhm
uhm told all about them and they cause they thought they were better and then and then the leaves kept asking them questions
s and then
no body talked
once upon a time a tortoise lived in a pond with two ducks
they were her very good friends she liked the ducks she could talk with them as much as she liked
the tortoise liked to talk she liked the sound of her voice
the tortoise and the ducks lived together for a long time the pond
ran out of water the ducks and the tortoise had no water to swim in
the two ducks could not live without water they were going to fly away to more water they w
went to the tortoise to say goodbye
oh don't leave me said the tortoise take me with you
i will die if i stay here but you can not fly said the ducks how can we take you with us
take me with you take me with you
said the tortoise the ducks felt bad they had an idea of how to take her we have a way to take you
they said but you must not move we'll each take one end
of a stick
you w
you take the middle in your mouth then we will fly up in the air with you but do not
talk if you open your mouth you will fall
the tortoise said she would not say a word
she would not even move her mouth she was very happy so the duck got a strong stick and held the ends
the tortoise bit the middle
then the two ducks flew away with their friend
they were high over the trees the tortoise wanted to say
how high we are but she could not talk the stick was in her mouth she kept still they saw a pretty house she wanted to say what is that
but she kept quiet
then they came to town people looked up and
saw them look
at the ducks carrying a tortoise they said
everyone ran to look the tortoise wanted to say
be quiet but she did not
this that is funny look at it
look they said the tortoise forgot the stick
she opened her mouth to say hush
she fell to the ground and
that was the end of the tortoise it is very good to be able to be quiet
i hate black feathers no matter how shiny said a proud crow i want to be a peacock
said a
he flew away
to a barnyard where we found some feathers from a peacock
he picked these up with his bill and placed them
in his own
feathers then the
then he danced back and forth looking
at his fine new coat he even tried to walk like a peacock
the peacocks came into the yard they did not know what to think at first
then they saw the crow was trying to dress and act like they did they flew at him calling
away with the cheat
away with the cheat they pulled out the
peacock feathers and many of his black ones
the crow was glad to get away alive but he flew back on to his own family
and old friends but one of the crows had seen him in the barnyard and had t and told the others how silly he had been acting
where have you been they cried we know
we know
we will not
have you in this flock
away away and they drove him away
even the owls
whom had always
hated
made eyes at him and screamed cheat
cheat
he flew into the forest there in a tree by a pond lived
a lone he lived
a lonely life
this three toads learned their funny song from him
this
hi
is his warning to them
don't
don't
be cheat don't be a be cheat
the tortoise
lived in a pond with two ducks the water dried up
and then the ducks wanted to fly away
and the turtle wanted to go with them
so the ducks took sticks and
told the turtle not to talk
just to bite the sticks
then she saw and then the turtle
was able to fly with the ducks
she saw lots of things and uhm
and when she saw people talking she said hush and fell
uhm
there was uhm either a crow or a rooster that wanted to look like a peacock cause he didn't want black feathers and then peacock saw him and pecked off feathers from him
and one of the other chickens
saw him
and told all the other chickens
and then they made him go away
and he went to live in a pond
don't forget to feed your fish called tom's mother
tom w would never forget to feed his fish he took very good care of them they were his first pets he had gotten
them for his birthday he loved to watch them swim and play in their
bowl
he gave them both names the gold one was named melvin the black one he called
but i think you are right why don't you go to the pet store maybe someone there can tell you what is wrong
can i help you asked the man at the pet store
i think my goldfish are sick tom said
well maybe i can help
tell me about your goldfish the man said
i have two fish
have two fish t said tom their names
chu what seems to be wrong with melvin and m
a lot faster than they do now i think they may be sick did you feed your fish tom asked mr chu yes sir i put just a little food
on the top of the water i like to watch them swim to the
to the top and eat it they make funny faces when they eat it they then they wiggle and swim away tom said
it sounds like you are feeding them the right way it's good that you take care of your pets said mr chu why don't you
we look at the fish here in the store you can show me what kind of goldfish you have that might help that might help us find out what is wrong with your pets tom and mr
mr chu walked to the back of the
pet store
the tanks were full of all kinds of fish
they were also
filled with bubbles why do you put bubbles in the fish tanks asked tom it looks like the fish are taking a bubble bath
these bubbles are filled with air explained mr chu fish need to breath air
to keep our fish healthy we clean
air and water
we use an air pump to put fresh air into their tanks the air pump makes the bubbles how does the water get clean asked tom
the the pump
pushes the water through a filter answered mr chu
the filter works like a net
it traps dirt that collects that collects in the water
when the water comes out of the pump it is clean tom looked at the fish but they couldn't stop th thinking about the bubbles mr chu why are some bubble
bi bubbles big why are some small
s some bubbles have more air in them than other bubbles
a bubble holds air just like a balloon said mr chu the more air you blow into a balloon the bigger it gets
t
tom looked at the bubbles in the fish tanks
my fishbowl doesn't have an air pump he said there are no bubbles of air in the water
is that why my fish are sick maybe said mr chu
how often do you change the water in the bowl i haven't changed it said tom
if you don't use a pump you must change the water twice a week said mr chu
when you give your fish fresh water they'll start to feel better they will get plenty of air to breathe thank you mr chu
chu said tom i want my fish to be happy
a long long time ago
it it was very cold
winter was coming and the birds flew away to the warm south
there they would wait for the spring
the one little bird had a broken wing and could could not fly
he could he did did not know what to do
he looked all round to see if there was any place where he could keep warm
he saw the trees of the big forest
maybe the trees will keep me warm through the winter he said
so he went to the forest hopping and fluttering with his broken wing
the first tree came he came to
was a silver birch
beautiful birch tree he said
will you let me live in your warm branches until springtime comes oh my said the birch
what a thing to ask
i have to take care of my own leaves through winter go away
the little bird hopped and fluttered
with his broken wing until he came to the next tree
it was a great big oak tree
oh big oak tree said the little bird
will you le
let me live in your warm branches until the springtime comes what a thing to ask said the oak tree if you stay in my branches all winter
you will be eating my acorns go away
the little bird hopped and fluttered his broken wing until he came to the willow tree
by the e
by
by the edge of the brook oh willow tree said the little bird
will you let me live in your warm branches until the springtime comes no said the willow tree i will never talk to s i never talk to strangers go away
the poor little bird did not know where to go
but he hopped and fluttered along with his broken wing
the spruce tree saw him he said where
where are you going little bird i do not know said the little bird the trees will not let me live with them
and my wing is broken and i cannot fly
he may live on one of my branches
said the spruce here is the warmest one of all
but may i stay all winter
yes said the spruce tree
i will like to have you
the pine tree beside the spruce
the pine tree stood beside the spruce when he saw little bird hopping and fluttering oh his broken wing
with his broken wing my branches are not very warm
but i can keep the wind off because i am big and strong
the little bird
fluttered in the warm branch of the spruce
the pine tree kept the wind off his house
then the juniper tree saw what the pine and the spruce were doing
she said that she would give the little bird his dinner
for the winter from her branches
juniper branch berries are very good for the little birds
the little bird was happy
in his warm nest away from the wind with juniper berries to eat
the tree at the edge of the forest the trees at the edge of the forest talked to each other i wouldn't take care of a strange bird said the birch a wouldn't risk my acorns said the oak
a would not talk i would not talk to strangers said the willow and the three trees stood up very tall and proud
that night the north wind came to the woods to play
he blew at the leaves with his icy breath and every leaf touch
it he touched fell to the ground
he wanted to touch every leaf in the forest
he loved the trees bare may i touch every leaf he said to the father
he said to his father the frost no said the frost king the trees which were kind to the bird with the broken wing may keep their leaves
so north wind had to leave them alone
the spruce the pine and the juniper tree kept their leaves all all leaves all the winter
and they
they ever ha and had they ever done and they have done so
ever since
uhm it was about a
uhm it was about a baby bird who couldn't fly south
and so he went to look for a place to live and he asked
three big trees and they wouldn't let him
and then
these three other trees let him
live with them and one tree gave him
he kept the wind off his house and other tree gave him dinner and then the north wind came and they and he blowed all the trees all the leaves off the trees who didn't let uhm
kept uhm there leaves

also studying how the
how to build
buildings that
would not fall down
in an earthquake
do you like it maria
asked
as francine
spread
out the plan
on the kitchen table is it
is the plan okay
where should my friends and i build our clubhouse one
question at a time francine
laughed
you have a good plan
but the walls should be
made
the
wood
not
bricks
but dad and i dug up
the bricks
said
the bricks from the
old can to the
they're still good
maria
plan on the bricks laughed
plan to explained
it's great to reuse materials francine said but bricks can fall
on you during an earthquake
earth
we haven't
had an earthquake here for a long time mr ruiz
and as he came into the kitchen
so why worry
but
you don't have to worry but i believe people should be
rock apart francine said earthquakes have done don't an
a lot of damage in some parts of
california will
there ever be
an earthquake near our ranch
maria asked
we don't know for sure francine
said
you our sure
to these
show that there has been some
minor rolls
said
some it can activity near here
earth
what's a mr
activity minor
asked
during most earthquakes
rock deep inside the earthquake
the earth moves
and breaks apart when the move the
earth that move
the earth these
vibrations
are called
it's
francine make waves
it's like dropping
a stone in a pool
of water maria nodded the stone splashes
and waves
go
out
in a circle
she said right francine
francine said sometimes the earth rolls
up and down if
an earthquake is strong enough it can
cause buildings to fall apart but you can make some buildings almost
stone earthquake proof
how maria asked
first you need to find a place to build
on that's solid
and that's
that area
by
the barn
there's is the there's probably
solid like
like
that area by the
granite deep
under the dirt
there granite
is a very
hard rock
it usually stays
firm
in an earthquake
francine picked
up
a pencil
an earthquake made
a
sketch
sketch
when you build
you should use wood and put a
granite sketch
here and here
here hey i have an idea mr
looked over francine's shoulder
you can build the clubhouse
on the stays one of
concrete
near the barn
we used
to have a shed
there when the wood
rotted
i tore
it down
that's great francine
said the building can be
braced
on the
concrete
thanks
dad and
thanks
for your help
francine
tomorrow and here
tomorrow said
i'm going to find
my friends and tell them
tell them we'll start
building tomorrow
one of maria's friends brought
sturdy wood
for
the end sides
of their building another brought a
piece of
concrete said
for the roof
by the end of the week the clubhouse was nearly finished
good choice for the roof francine
said
one afternoon as the
as she checked on the by
hard asked
have there's
is lightweight we to
so it won't hurt anyone if there's an earthquake
the last job was to make a sign
maria had just finished
when
are roll so
cat
her cat
streaked past are you oh
streaked past just
acting a pile of
bricks
jumped
onto the clubhouse and
them was
the other side
maria shook
her cat
she are her head are oh
had never acted like this
like this said then maria felt the ground
fell
the ground shake
she looked over toward the barn
the farm
bell
was ringing
by itself
maria couldn't believe
it believe what was happening for for a minute maria could
not move her
side
nothing earth
walked
she
over on
to her side
are you okay francine
ran toward them
but a few dishes fell on the shelves
an said
ducked under the table
i'd be safe i'm glad
you two were
out in the open
nothing
could fall on you
oh it was
only a little rock
and
roll mr ruiz
tried to smile
did you know the earthquake
earthquake was coming
unfortunately no francine
said however
there
were in
there were a few signs
the like more
signs activity
an and today the chickens
were acting strangely we
her cat too
too more were a minute did
francine
no nodded animals smile
may feel
movement
deep in the earth before we can feel it but we
can't
depend
on them
we have to learn
right
what to do when an earthquake like strikes right maria
said with a smile like building
building
an earthquake
proof
clubhouse
uhm they want to build a clubhouse and
she goes to a friends
well uhm she goes either to they francine either goes to mara's house or
mara goes to francine's house uhm and they ask
what they should do to build a clubhouse like
so and uhm
once they start building the clubhouse when it's almost finished uhm
they feel movement in the ground
and when it stops francine says uhm
you're lucky you two were outside
y y nothing could have fell down on you uhm and so yeah

clint took out his special box he kept his favorite things in that box
there was
arrowhead he found in a field
there was a beautiful golden shell
and a key chain from the zoo
when he was a boy
clint wished he could
could win a blue ribbon just like his dad did
this summer i'll get
the the chance he thought
if clint
could think of a project for his
farm club he just might win
the club gave ribbons f for the best projects
clint needed a good idea
clint always helped her
he loved to dig in
he loved to dig in the dirt and plant seeds the best part was watching the seeds sprout
as clint worked in the garden
he got a great idea why don't i try to grow something all by myself
i
i could enter
what i grow
as my project for the f fan club
clink
clint went to his
to look for his father he found him working at in the barn
dad
can you tell me for a minute
dad
can you talk to me for a minute
clint asked sure clint his fat
said his father what can i do for you
well do you remember that blue ribbon
you won at the f at the fair
i really want to win one too said clint
i th i think
i was thinking maybe i could grow something
all by myself to enter at
at the fair i wonder what kinds of seeds i could plant
finished clint
go to the seed basket take
look at
what is there said dad whatever seeds you choose i'll be glad to help
clint
took his seeds
to look
looked at the seed packets
at the bottom of the basket was a packet marked sweet corn
when clint saw those words he almost
t
taste the wonderful corn
da
this is it dad
i'm going to grow sweet corn
blue ribbon sweet corn
dad smiled to clint
to see clint so excited
you'd better read the di directions he said
growing good corn takes a lot of
work
clint read the direction on the seed packet
plant sweet corn in early may
get ground ready for planting
three
in a sunny spot
four plant seeds in straight rows
five water seeds once
a week
if it does if it does not rain
the corn should be fully grown in eighty five days i think i could i think i could do th do it dad said clint
good
good said dad today is may your first so you better start now
you can use the small
plot by your mother's garden to plant your crop
the afternoon in the afternoon clint planted the corn
seeds in neat in four neat rows in neat rows
s spring turned into summer the days passed quickly
clint
when it didn't rain clint remembered to water his corn
soon
soon the gr
greens shot
shoots were growing tall and straight slowly
long leaves grew out
of the stalks but julie planted
were
were as tall as clint
one day
dad and clint stood out by the corn plant
it's time to watch for the tallest
what are the tall
answered
they grow on top of the corn
ears if the corn
it ears of the corn the wind helps
corn pol pollen fall over the plant
c clint looked at his corn plants
how does
the pollen help the plants string of each corn silk
hang
hangs out of each corn husk
the strings
ca catch the
pollen said dad
they ta
they take it into the cob where the kernels will grow
there
there is one string of corn silk for each kernel
when pollen reaches the cob the kernel
begin begin to grow
every day clint checked
his plants
his plants for tassels he wondered if
if they would
blow enough pollen
onto the silk
one of one afternoon clint found his dad in the fields
dad he said i'm worried that not enough pollen
will fall on the
on the corn silk
well said dad sometimes the wind doesn't blow enough pollen onto the silk
then the farmer has to help you
want
want your corn to be especially good
maybe you should think
up a way to sprinkle the pollen onto your silk yourself
clint thought
finally he looked at some some of his parents farming
magazines an hour later clint ran
to his head
an hour later clint ran to his head corn plants he found a way to spread the pollen
first he put
next he held the bag shut
at the bottom carefully he bent
the pollen would not spill out of the bag
and
on the corn silk e
silk of each ear soon silk husks of each plant were c covered with pollen
it was long hard work but clint was happy
he had solved the problem just like a real farmer
over next f over the next few weeks the corn grew quickly clint worked
in
in his rows every day finally he marked off the last of the eighty five days
the morning three ears of corn
these ears are the best he said
i'll enter
them in the fair
when the fair w was over clint came home
father
to his father's
now there were two blue ribbons in the family
ok
glenn
uh he wanted to
enter the he wanted to get a blue ribbon
like his dad did
and uh
he entered the
country fair
b
while the thing he entered were
uh
his c were corn
and everyday he watered them finally the stalks came up and
uh
he
stalks came up and then he
and then one day he said to his dad that
he thought the not not enough uh
pollen was being sprinkled onto the
c s corn silk and
then his dad told him to try to think up a way to do it
and then he thought up
a way
and this is the how he did it he took
uh a p paper bag
and he
tipped it down i mean closed it at the bottom
and he took the bag and sprinkled the pollen on to the corn silk and then he entered his three best husks
in the contest and he won the contest
where do i start
ramon and rita sat on the back porch of
new home
they had moved to the
country
just two weeks ago
ramon
ramon still missed the city
he missed playing with his friends on their street
did i read this
rita finished try try staring onto a kite
what a great day for flying a kite
she smiled
at her
brother
i hate the country
ramon said
quite
quiet here
it's not so quiet said
rita
there are lots of sounds
they're just not
the same kinds of
sounds sounds that you hear in new york
ramon
ramon
ramon an listened listened
he heard birds singing
he heard
call
cowbells ringing from the farm down
the road
he heard the soft sound of wind blowing through trees
then they heard something strange
what was that asked rita
i don't know
ramon looked around the
porch
i think
the house is
groaning
whispered rita
maybe it's the wind said
ramon
the sound stops
when
when the wind stops
it starts when the wind blows
it's the house that's making
the noise
like no i don't
like it
ramon said rita
the wind blew
this time
ramon knew what it was
ramon walked over to the
empty
bottles
on
the porch
and rita f
flowed
followed
he picked up a bottle and blew
across
the top of it
was
there it was that strange sound
so that's what been making those add n odd noises
said
a voice behind them
mother was standing at the door
why does the bottle make that sound
mom asked rita
she felt
silly for
talking
that the house is
<unk>
round
come inside said
their mother
take while i work
ramon and rita picked up the bottles
and
followed
mother into the house
ok i finished
several boxes sat
on
the kitchen floor
mom was talking
dashes out of
one box
a bot
putting
them away
of
a bottle mom explained
the
air inside the bottle
vibrates
what does vibrate mean asked
ramon
inside
the bottle moves back
and forth very quickly mom answered
these
movements are called vibrations
dad came into
the room
look kids he said
i can show
you what
vibrates
he
held a rubber band in his hand
dad pulled the rubber band tight between two fingers
pull the rubber band rita he
said
and then
let it go
ok i'm done
ramon watched rita pulled the rubber band
and
let it go
it moved quickly
did you see the rubber
band
vibrate
dad
it moved back and forth very fast
it and made the air around it move very fast
the air moving back and forth those
movements are
vibrating
right
asked ramon
ramon
and vibrate ins
make
the sounds right
asked rita
mom smiled
those vibrates move through
the air into
our ears mom explained
our ears
send a message
to our brain
and
that's how
we hear sounds
rita picked up a bottle
she blew across the top
of it
the bottle sounds like
a whistle said
ramon
that's right said dad
there is more
ram
ramon said
is for
the air
to vibrate
a short bottle makes a
higher sound
it has less
room inside
for the air
to vibrate
dad said
ramon we have
many sizes
sends
of bottles
will they all make different sounds
let's try them said dad
each bottle made a different sound
you there were lots of things to hear round
here
here joked rita
then a new sound filled
the room
it
thunder said mom
there must be a
storm coming
done
we'd better sh shut the windows
ramon
and
rita decided to
close the windows
dad closed the door
they finished
just in time
the wind started blowing harder
suddenly the house
really
did begin to groan
everyone looked around
where is that awful noise
awful noise coming from asked mom
i never heard a sound like
that
new york rita whispered
ramon was sitting
near the fireplace
when
they heard a groan again
i think
it's coming
from
the fireplace he said
the fireplace is making a spooky sound
the winds
the wind slowed down for a moment
rita began
laugh
it's just
chimney
the chimney is like
a giant bottle
when the wind blows over it
the air
inside vibrates
and because it's so
tall it makes a really deep sound
ramon
i think
a
i think
ramon
and rita are right laughed mom
as if to prove what they had said
the wind blew again i'm done
the house groaned
uhm there's a huge storm and there went over and it sounded like vibrating
and they s thought it was like it was really hard wind going over and it was making freaky noise
and they thought it was really hard wind
and they learned about vibrating
should i start reading here or here
jeff gripped the chain with one quick push of the pedal and the chain wrapped around the gear there he said to his friend mike
now try it
mike rode his bicycle down the driveway
and circled back towards jeff gee thanks he said
i like this brand new bike
jeff grinned
i liked f
f he liked fixing things
then he looked up just in time to see ha his new puppy running up the hill
mom he cried there goes puddles
can we go a after him on our n on our bikes
jeff's mom l looked out the window
yes but come home in time to do your homework
remember you must
turn
in your ideas for
for your science project tomorrow
the boys jumped on their bikes and headed up the hill
they saw puddles up ahead
his golden ears flopped up and down
as he ran over the hilltop the boys pushed harder
on the pedals as they climbed up the steep hill
as they climbed the steep hill
change your gears mike
yelled jeff
jeff watched as mike
a as mike's chain slipped
see where was i
thanks jeff
that makes pedaling much easier
at the top of the hill the boys stopped
to catch their breath
mike was puzzled
jeff why di
why did
shifting make it easier to pedal
i don't know it's got something to do
to do with with the gears answered jeff
i'm glad that that we won't need to pedal so so hard going down the hill
the boys looked down the hill below they could see
the roller coaster at the new
and s
t
<unk>
huh
great
<unk>
<unk>
<unk>
i wonder if you work
hello
do you work
great
at the roller coaster at the new
oh well i'll just skip it
<unk> park
the park was called fun s
station
look at that those hills mike
i'll bet we we would need some big gears to climb them
and strong legs too
added mike jeff looked down at the fun station fence
there was puddles digging under the gate oh no
he groaned mom said that fun station was off limits
until it opens next summer
the boys
coasted down coasted
that as that doesn't
all
the boys coasted down the hill
all their
uphill pedaling
jeff wondered h how fast
they
they were go going
and he imagined how fast they could gain
they could
go on the roller coaster
jeff and mike squeeze squeezed their
hand brakes slow down
when they reached the fence jeff dropped to his knees
dropped to his knees
he peered through the hole
puddles was
was
was
was what
was
no how
in s
ok that's hard
no
now here
please tell me you work
great
uhm
ok ok just try and get <unk>
puddles was
no here
in sight
but puddles did not return
then over the sounds of the workers they heard
a familiar bark from the other s side of the fence a woman spoke
have you lost your dog
yes
yes
yes cried jeff
do you have puddles
well said the woman
if i didn't know
it's
puddles but i have a little
cocker spaniel here
that's puddles
cried jeff
can you m can
can you make him come back through his hole
the woman laughed
here here it will be easier for puddles if i open the gate
a few minute
in a few minutes puddles
when it was in jeff's arms jeff hugged him hard
puddles wiggled to get free
but jeff wasn't about to let him escape again
jeff looked looked up at the woman thank you for bringing puddles out
no problem said the young woman
my name is lisa
i'm one of the engineers building
the great
gravity mansion
i was
i was playing with puddles when i heard you call
there's more
what's the great
gravity mansion asked jeff
that's the name of the roller coaster
lisa pointed
toward the big
st
steel hi hills
wow
it's huge
said mike i can see why they call it great
but what about gravity
well gravity is a force
a force pushes
or pulls things
explained lisa
on a roller coaster the cars are attached to the chain
that wraps around the gears
when the
engine turns the gears the chain pulls the top of the cars up the first hill
the first hill is always the highest one
when the cars reach the top the force of gravity pulls them them down the hill
when when they reach the bottom the cars are going fast enough to get the
next hill by themselves
yeah jeff nodded
gravity is why
we coasted so fast down the hill on our bikes
that's right
lisa replied your bicycle
and the roller coaster both use gravity
but there is one big difference your b bikes have pedals
the coaster cars have no pedals and no engine
the roller coaster is made of several simple machines
simple machines have only two one or two parts
one simple simple machine
is
an
incline
incline
plane inclined
inclined
is an inclined plane
that's just another name for a ramp
is a ramp a machine asked mike
sure a are said lisa
a mansion
is anything that helps
a machine
is
is anything
or
that help
that helps
you do things more easily
suppose that you have had to climb straight up
from the ground to the top of the roller coaster hill
that would be tough said jeff
a ramp
than to go straight
a ramp than to go straight up
explained lisa up
then mike had an idea
our bikes go up the hill are they machines
the
your bike is made of several of several simple machines
the pedals help you turn the wheels the pedals are part of a simple machine called
the wheel
and axle
axle
huh that doesn't make sense at all oh well
the hand brakes are simple machines called levers
how b how about the gears
asked mike
you're right
gears are also simple machines
answered the li lisa
just then puddles jumped from jeff's arms
jeff
jeff caught the puppy and clapped
on his leash
i guess puddle thinks it's time to go home laughed jeff
puddles pulled at his leash while the boys thanked lisa
you're very welcome
she said come back in the summer
and let me know how
you like the roller coaster ride
as the boys turned toward home mike thought about his homework
i know what i'm going to do for a science fair for the science fair he announced i'm going to figure out how gears work on my bike
j jeff smiles
he planned to build a roller coaster for his car collection
he'd call it
the little gravity machine
well
jeff and
uh jeff and
uh
i forget what the other person's name was
jeff and
oh jeff and the other person who he was riding with they were riding on their bikes
and
i think it was jeff's new puppy came running out
came running out and he escaped
and he ran down to the
like a roller coaster
and
well
he dug underneath the fence
and got into this little area
so the boys followed
and
uhm
well they're trying to find the dog and then this lady well she was playing with the dog
and she heard the boys yelling for the dog
so she brought the dog to them
and asked if they had lost a dog
and they said yes so she gave the dog to them
and it was theirs and then like they they were
they got to see how
uhm a roller coaster
and they got to learn how a roller coaster was made
and about the gravity
and
about
the bikes have something in common with with the roller coaster
hey joe
joe
i
julie
julio
julio did you hear there's going to be a big race in four weeks said <unk>
<unk>
derek
to his friend i'm going
to race
and i'm going to
win
julio laughed
at derek
and said oh really
prove it i'll race you to my house and we'll see who wins ready set go shouted derek the two boys
ran as fast as they could at
first they were running at the same speed
it's not so great
thought julio but after i
after a while <unk> derek
was far ahead
of
julio
<unk> derek turned and shouted
told you told i'm going to win the race you might as well not even sign up
you julio
julio
julio was mad
he could hardly catch his breath
his body felt tired
when he got home he slammed the door behind him what's wrong his big sister
ellen
asked there's going to be a big race derek is going to beat me
he beats
me at everything
julio said sadly
elle
elena
had an idea why don't you train
for the race
how do i do that
julio asked
come
to the track
practice tomorrow
you can
talk
to my coach
i'm sure he can help you
said
ellen
the next day julio went to see coach
ben
son benson
if you want to be a better runner
there are
three things you should do
she said
first you should run for fifteen minutes every day how will that help
asked julio when you run
when you run
you
she lots of
you use lots of muscles in your body
explained coach
because
you your muscles aren't used to running if you run a little every day muscles will
your muscles will get
stronger
muscles
at the
<unk>
er
s
ex
ex
can work longer without getting tired
ec
ek
ek
exercise can work
longer without getting tired ok said julio what else can i do in
a race
there's you
only want to be able to run
and
not get tire every
you also want to run fast
said coach benson
so the second thing
you should
do
it you should do is some sprinting
you should do it every other day don't know
do you know what sprinting is
sprinting means
julio thought for a moment he had never heard the word before i don't think so
coach
he said
pick a spot that is not too far away
race
race to it as fast as you can
rest for a minute then race back to where you started
that's
that's what springing means do
do
that four times explained
explained coach
benson
don't forget to warm up
before you run that is the third important thing to do
your
to do
your sister can show you how
julio looked
at ellen
what does warm up mean he asked warming up means doing
stretching exercises ellen said
you stretch your muscles muscles that haven't been stretched
haven't been stretched
can get hurt it is always good to stretch before running ok
big sister show me what to do said julio
for the next four weeks julio went to the park every day training
for
the race it was not easy sometimes he didn't feel like running but he made
himself do it coach and his sister had told him to al he always
s
stretched his muscles before he ran
every other day julio worked on his speed
he could choose a tree
not too far away
and
race to it he would rest by counting to six
teen
then he would run back
to where he started then he'd do it over again
each time he
ah practiced sprinting he
he thought of what it would be like when he beat
derek in the big race
at first julio found found it hard to run he was out of breath
he could feel his heart
pounding his ch
in his chest but as the days passed he ran longer and faster without getting tired
his muscles got stronger the stronger he got the more he could run he used

himself and he knew he was getting faster

he was happy to know

cassie took out
cassie looked at the postcard it had no postmark or stamp because it had come in a letter to her mother
it was from aunt red wing ever since aunt red wing had begun to travel she had put postcards for cassie in mother's letters aunt red wing wing took people on trips all over the world the postcards she sent cassie always had a riddle about where she was this postcard read
cassie studied the riddle i wonder how the length of shadows can tell where aunt red wing is
i think it i'll ask matt cassie thought
public library cassie liked to visit him there as she walked to the library cassie read the riddle over and over again
noon shadows are long the sun sets soon
where is it cold in the month of june she had some ideas but the
but
a
the two is in the way right here
to ask matt a question
alright now press next
hi said matt when cassie came
to his desk what's new hi said cassie look what i have another postcard from aunt red wing matt laughed that means you have another riddle to figured out
yes i do cassie said shadows are the first clue to the riddle can you tell the seasons by the length of shadows
you certainly can said matt he reached for the lamp on his desk look on the floor cassie what do you see when i hold the lamp like this cassie looked to the floor i see a short shadow she said
but i don't see what it has to do with the seasons let's pretend that this lamp is the sun said matt when the light shines from above the shadow is short during the summer the noon sun is high in the sky and shadows are shorter
but when i hold the lamp at this angle the shadow grows longer
that's right said matt
when i hold the lamp at an angle like the n noon sun
is in winter the shadows are long
aunt red wing is in a place where the noon shadows are long said cassie
since the noon noon sun is low in winter it must be winter where aunt red wing is cassie was proud of herself
that's right said matt
what's the next clue the second clue is that the suns sets soon cassie thought for a moment
i know the sun sets much earlier in the winter than it does in the summer
so what also tells us it's winter where aunt red wing is
right again said matt
but i haven't solved the riddle yet said cassie she looked at the globe on matt's desk isn't isn't this the equator she asked pointing to a line around the middle of the globe that's right said matt
well said cassie people who live south of the equator have winter starting in june and summer in january don't they that's true said matt
if it is winter in june then aunt red wing must be somewhere out south of the equator cassie thought
she looked carefully at the globe aunt red wing could be in south america or australia or maybe she's somewhere in africa said cassie
maybe there's another clue said matt
what is the picture on the card
it's some animal i didn't
look too closely cassie turned the postcard over
she laughed a koala bear look matt it's a koala bear they live only in australia don't they matt nodded we were so busy trying to guess the riddle that we never even looked at the picture
that's right said cassie australia has
koala bears and winter in june
and long winter shadows at noon said matt and aunt red wing and her riddles riddles laughed cassie
ok
they were trying to figure out where their
uhm aunt red wing was
and
she wrote a rid riddle on the postcard and they never looked at the picture so
they were trying to guess
and
mm
and uhm
at the end they uhm were looked at the uhm picture
and they saw it was a koala bear and they
once upon a time a tortoise lived in a pond with two ducks they were
they were her very good friends she liked ducks
she could talk with them as much as she liked
the tortoise liked to talk she liked the sound of her voice
the tortoise and the ducks lived together a long time then the pond ran out of water the ducks and the tortoise had no water to swim in
the t q
the two ducks could not live without water
they were going to fly away to more water
they went to the tortoise to say goodbye
oh don't leave me said the tortoise take me with you will die if i stay here
but how can we
but
you can not fly said the ducks
how can we take you with us
take me with you with you take me with you said the tortoise the ducks felt bad
but they had
an idea of how to take her
we have you
we have a way to take you they said
but you must not have
not you must not move we will each take one of the
one end of a stick
you will fall
you will take the middle in your mouth then
we will fly up in the air with you but do not talk if you open your mouth
you will fall
the tortoise said she would not say a word she would not even move her mouth
s she was very happy so the ducks got a strong stick
and
held the ends
the tortoise bit the middle then the two ducks flew away with their friend
they were over the trees the tortoise wanted to say how high
we are but she could not talk
the stick was in her mouth
so she kept still they swam saw a pretty house she wanted to say what is that but she kept quiet
they came
to a town
people looked up and saw them look at the ducks carrying a tortoise they said
everyone ran to look the tortoise wanted to say be quiet she did
did not
but she did not that is funny look at it look she said tortoise forgot the stick
she opened her mouth to say hush she fell
to the ground she was
that was the end of the tortoise
it is a very g
it is good to be able to be quiet
the
water
went away in the pond that they lived in
so they had to go to a different pond
but the tortiose couldn't come
so they needed to put a uhm
st they had to carry a stick and the tortoise had to bite the stick
uhm so they could go
but then uhm the people wanted to
then the people were kind of laughing at the tortoise and the tortoise uhm
really wanted to say hush to the uhm people but she didn't until she forgot about the stick
and then she did say hush and she opened her mouth
and she fell and
that was the end of her

laurel spread on the tax texas map out on the dining room table
she looked at the green patch on the left and read the words big bend national park
this is where we'll put our rafts in the water she said she moved her hand down the rio grande river then she stopped
and this is and this is rock slide
what is rock slide asked laurel
it's a surprise of the trip mom answered with a smile we've got to pack our clothes and pick up some fresh fruit for uncle don uncle don was laura laurel's favorite uncle this year he promised to take them on a ri on
one of his river trips
in his letter uncle don said we must carefully measure the weight of everything we bring
we don't want the raft to be too heavy he wants us to fill our big cooler with fruit and ice we'll measure everything in pounds because that's how we'll we'll buy the fruit
he said the filled uhm cooler w can't weigh more than seventy two pound our cooler weighs thirty pounds we can fill two three l
liter plastic bottles with water and freeze them
each one will weigh four pounds that means we can bring thirty pounds of fruit said laurel exactly said mom
now we can estimate the way of some fruit uhm and make a shopping list
on the way to the store laurel wrote her list fourteen apples fourteen oranges and twenty bananas two melons and two pineapples
and two bunches of grapes at the store laurel and her mom carefully weighed the fruit on the list it weighed thirty four pounds
that was a pretty good estimate mom said yes but i'd better take off some fruit
the next day
laurel watched uncle don load the rafts with supplies the rafts sank lower into the water as he piled the cooking gear
water uncle don answered in summer people need lots of water each day
laurel was surprised uncle don had measured everything carefully before the trip she was glad that uhm they had been so careful with the fruit each person h uhm put on a life jacket laurel's mass
uhm was thirty one kilograms
laurel rode in uncle don's raft she climbs on top of the duffle bag and watched uncle don pull his oars through the water
then she looked into the river how deep is the rio grande grande she asked
let's find out by estimating said uncle don he pushed an oar into the water until it hit the bottom then he pulled it out
compare the wet part of the oar to with the ice chest the ice chest is about eight centimeters long
wow the wet pair is about twice as long
that's one and a half meters uncle don looked worried the river is low it is going to be a rough trip through the rock slide
what is the r what's a rock slide laurel was puzzled
uncle don smiled just wait you'll find out soon
that night they came on the river bank under the stairs in the morning the river looked even lower
eat up l laughed uncle don
don the more you eat the lighter the r rafts will be when we get to rock slide
what rock slide could be as they paddled small rapids rippled in the distance why do rapids look different in the then the
then the re rest of the r
uh river
uhm asked laurel
look at the water uncle don explained what's what is a different about the water in the rapids
laurel stared at the ripples it's shallow she said
i can see little rocks at the bottom
right
we can now we can watch the leaf flow through the ra rapids a said uncle don the water is faster too laurel added you're right again
are we going to ride any big rapids asked laurel not until rock slide done uncle don smiled
early in the afternoon uncle don decided to stop and camp why are we stopping now laurel asked
listen whispered uncle don above the splashing laurel could hear a faint roar
that's rock slide uncle don said mysteriously we'll need plenty of daylight when we reach i'll i'll also have to repack the rafts very carefully
laurel listened to the roar she wondered how a rock slide could make such a sound it took long time for her to fall asleep that night
the next morning everyone got on the rafts laurel you ride with your mother today said uncle don laurel looked at the rafts the food and chests and water jugs were almost empty
the rafts seemed much higher in the water
uncle don is making his raft higher
uh lighter she's thought
i bet it's shallow it's a shallow rock slide
as they turned to the next bend on the river laurel saw the other r rafts resting on the bank
the river had disappeared into a mountain of rocks
uh she had one sinking thought
rock slide uncle don climbed in uh climbed the rocks overlook rock slide everyone followed
laurel looked down into the canyon there ws a lazy rio grande turned into fast
fierce rapids uncle don told everyone how to travel through the rapids stay close to the sides of the cliffs he said
laurel looked at the water it was darker near the cliffs it must be deeper there she thought
as soon as uhm laurel huddled in the middle of the speeding raft all around the water uhm
all around her water roared as it crashed over the rocks
paddles pulled their wa their water pulled through the water rafts bounced uhm off the canyon walls
uh when laurel's boat leaned against the rocks she laughed as the raft turned and tossed at last the r
the raft reached the canyon floor
a tried happy group
they had survived rock slide but laurel had learning something learned something too
she learned that a safe trip has nothing to do with luck you must carefully plan and measure your load if you want to master the rio grande at rock slide
uhm so
there were can i take my headphones off
uhm
so there were uhm
what's her name
there was laurel and her mom they were going on a rock slide
thi place it was a uhm
well it was she didn't know what it was so she was really excited
and they had to pack
uhm lots of stuff and they had to know exactly how much it weighed
because they didn't want it to be to heavy
uhm and then they would go camping and
they always
uhm
they all uhm laurel always wanted to know what it was and she'd ask lots of questions
uhm and
then at last they go on it and laurel found out that it wasn't any luck to go on the rock slide it was just having fun
you had to measure
a long low sound awakened
newt from his dreams honk honk the sound stopped all newt could hear was the waves slapping on the beach then the lonely sound returned honk honk
newt ran n to the window he ope he couldn't see the lights in town he couldn't see the moon
the night air felt cold and damp
from the next room aunt ellen spoke it's only the fog horn next we're fogged in he crawled back to bed and soon dreamed again
newt awoke
to a hazy world he watched water drip from the porch roof as he ate blueberry muffins the fog was beginning to clear
the fog horn honked again why do they need a horn to tell us it's foggy he asked we can see the fog
aunt ellen laughed
the foghorn doesn't sound to tell us it's foggy it sound
s to warn sailors about rocks and land it's like a lighthouse for
the ears
neat newt said newt arrived yesterday
newt had arrived yesterday
to spend a week of his summer vacation with aunt ellen
she had promised to take him sailing on her boat
this fog won't last long she said the temperature drops dropped last night the water vapor
in the air
constructed no water droplets that make up the fog
soon sunlight will warm up the air
that will turn the fog on
into vapor again
then we can go sailing
by ten thirty the fog horn had
newt and aunt
ellen put on life jackets they carried
their picnic lunch and
oars down the sandy path to the dock
a rowboat drifted from the rope tied to the dock they climbed in and aunt helen rowed
will
r rolled to the sailboat
as they planned to sail to an island and spend
the day exploring
aunt
ellen owned a small sailboat it had tin it had a tiny cabin
did you ever want a motor boat newt asked
aunt ellen smiled
no she said why not asked newt
if the wind stops then you can't go anywhere motors are noisy replied aunt helen i like the peace and quiet of sailing sometimes
there's no wind but i know that soon the wind will the blow again
newt
helped raise the sail on the mast
a pole rising from the center of the boat the sail reminded newt of a hang
hanging on a clothesline
but the sail was tied
at its corners instead of letting the breeze slip under it the way the sheet did
the sail caught the breeze cast off mooring line aunt ellen said newt untied the rope that held the boat he could feel the boat begin to move
i'm going to teach you to steer aunt helen said this
is the tiller you use it to steer the boat
she pushed the tiller and left the side of the boat
the front of the boat moved to the right then when newt moved the tiller toward the right the boat turned left
aunt ellen moved the sail to catch more wind you sail by knowing the direction of the wind she said
right now the wind is coming from the ocean
how do you know
how do you know newt asked one way is to look
at that flag on the town dock aunt helen explained what if you're far from land and you can't see a flag wind asked i tie a piece of red yarn to the top of the mast
aunt helen pointed up see it
it's called a
telltale this i this is the morning breeze blowing
in from the beach
in the evening the wind blows out from land why doesn't the wind always go the same way
in the daytime the ocean is cooler
than the land so the air above the water is cooler than the air above the land
do you know that
what cool air does to warm air asked aunt ella it pushes it out of the way
said newt
right when the cool
ocean air pushes the warm land air out of the way
the breeze blows from the ocean to the land
in the evening the opposite happens because the land cools off more quickly than the ocean does
when the cooler air
pushes the warm
ocean air out of the way we get a breeze from the land to the ocean two hours later the
boat neared the island and
entered a cove newt steered a boat
the boat
t toward a sandy beach then aunt helen dropped the anchor
and they waded
and they
waded ashore
after newt and aunt helen ate they explored the island they returned to the beach
late in the afternoon newt noticed that the air was still
there
no wind at all what happened to the wind he ask it is just the afternoon
do
doldrums aunt el
aunt ellen
the land and the sea are just
about the same temperatures
so there's no wind
but
how will we get home again newt asked don't worry there's going to be a good wind after six o'clock
aunt helen replied why don't we
collect some shells while we wait at six thirty the wind picked up aunt helen decided to get back on the boat
as they raised the sail
newt watched it snap in
the suddenly st strong breeze
is that magic or what know what asked it's changing temperatures that we talked about
the mainland is beginning to cool it cools faster than the ocean
the cool air pushes the warmer ocean out of the way so now the wind is coming from the land newt and said i want to learn how to sail can we go again tomorrow aunt ellen smiled
will tomorrow be a good day for sailing let's ask the sunset
what will that tell us asked
he asked she said red sky in the morning sailors take warnings red sky at night sailors' delight the red sun settled down
on the western horizon the es the rosy glow of clouds stretched across the sky
and turned the white sail pink
newt decided that tomorrow would be a fine day for sailing
on the wind
uhm
he uhm
m
it uhm he heard the foghorn when he got up
and
uhm
he wasn't sure what it was and then his aunt
told him that it was uhm
for sailors to know that
they were coming closer
and
so they wouldn't bump into things
and then
uhm they went sailing and newt learned about
how
uhm the wind works and when it's good time for sailing
and then they uhm went on to they waited to the beach and they
uhm
got
they collected shells
and
uhm his aunt told him
to tell her if it was a good day for sailing tommorrow and he said and he asked her why and she said that
red sky at night sailor's delight red sky in the morning sailor's take warning
and it was red night at night so it would be a good day

there was a dog in the park near where he lived
he didn't enjoyed playing at the dog park because he didn't have to be on his leash when he was
sil
there so he could run as much as he liked
there was one dog at the park named fang
he would always come up to racer and bite his back legs and run away saying bark bark bark bark
which in dog talk means you are too slow to catch me with that limp of yours so i'm going to pick you on you racer
sil
would always chase fang but he could never catch him
one day racer went to the vet
racer liked the vet because the people in w in white costumes gave him treats
racer didn't know it but he was at the vet to have surgery to fix his legs
when he woke up from the surgery he didn't he didn't even remember where he was but soon his owners came and drove him home
on the drive home racer realized that his legs itched very badly
he thought oh boy i'm going to lick my leg so hard that the itching is going to go away
so he turned to his head around to lick his legs but there was a big white thing in his way
<br> he was wearing a collar that made it impossible to lick his legs
a few days later he went with his owners to the dog park
racer had
sil
had to
sil
<br> had to be on
<unk>
a leash <unk> since he still needed
sil
to heal from his surgery
<unk> but it was nice to see all his friends
mean old fang said bark bark bark bark
<unk> which meant why do you have to wear that stupid looking collar
sure does look silly
<unk> even eventually racer didn't have to wear the collar but by then his legs didn't itch
so he didn't want to lick them
for six week weeks racer would
sil
take walks and go to the dog park but he still had to be on a leash
one day he took a a walk through the dog park and h his friends were there as usual
then his owners reached out <unk> around his neck and took off his leash
just then fang bit him on the back leg and ran away racer's own owners said go run
<br> so racer started running and chasing fang
fang was las laughing because he knew racer could never catch him but suddenly he noticed that racer was catching up to him
racer was running faster than he could ever remember and before he knew it it ha
sil
it he had caught up
sil
to fang and knocked him down
racer said bark bark which in dog talk means don't pick on me any more fang
and from that day on fang never bit racer's legs
racer was so happy that he could run fast and
sil
that he
sil
and ran in circles
finally he ran back to his owners and gave h them a big kisses for fixing his legs
ok um that racer was a dog that loved to run and that's why he was named racer
and um fang when he back leg so that he said ha ha you'll never catch me and so
sil
racer would try to catch him but he never could because his legs were so <br> um
hurt and they had and he had to limp when he ran and so one day he went to the vet
and
sil
um <br> he after the thing he couldn't remember anything and so when he got in the car his legs were itchy and so he tried to go and itch them
but um there was this big white collar really a cast that was on his legs and so r
racer wanted to itch them but his leg couldn't be itched and then
um his owners drove him home and then racer went to the park
a and um fang said hey why are you wearing that big white collar sure does look funny
and then after that um
sil
he had to be on a leash um racer and all the time every single time
and then one day um he didn't have to wear it but he was on a leash and fang bit his back leg
and um then his owners let go of his leash and said go and get him boy and then racer just ran and ran and ran and then he was finally catching up and then he caught up to him

justin and his hat
one day justin and his mother went shopping for hats and found the perfect one
but justin would never wear the hat and that made his mom roll her eyes
it wasn't that he didn't like the hat in fact he loved it
he thought it was great
it totally fit his head he loved the way it was a little tight at first but then stretched to the perfect size
he loved the color the size the shape and the new hat smell
he even liked the way his hair looked when he took the hat off
unfortunately justin was too smart for his own good
he figured out that the hat would get dirty or lost if he wore it too much so he made a promise to himself that he would never wear it except on special days
he wanted the hat to be clean and perfect forever
if it gets dirty i'll wash it silly said his mother
but it'll shrink if you wash it and then it'll be too small he said
sil
his father said you should really wear the hat if you like it or else you will be sorry
but justin didn't listen and everyday the hat sat in a clear plastic box so it wouldn't get dirty
sometimes justin would imagine himself walking around school with the hat on his head
once he even imagined himself as a grown up wearing the hat and speaking
sil
in front of many people
he imagined the people whispering to themselves what a fine speaker he is and such a handsome hat too
on his next birthday he decided to wear the hat
there were many presents but the only thing that made justin was
sil
excited was getting to wear his hat
he went to his room opened the plastic box and took the hat out very carefully
then slowly slid it on
it was a little tight at first like it was supposed to be
it was just like he remembered
he was so happy that he couldn't help but smile
i know it's just a hat he thought to himself but i sure do love it
sil
but then he noticed that it wasn't stretching
sil
something was wrong it was a little tight
justin could tell it wasn't perfect anymore
he knew crying wouldn't help make the hat perfect again but he cried anyway
he told his parents i don't want any of those gifts i want to return them all and try
sil
to find a new perfect hat instead
his parents looked at each other and knew that justin had learned a good lesson
son we
sil
we would be happy to buy you a new hat but only if you promise to wear it the father said
justin replied i promise that if we find the perfect hat i'll wear it everyday
so the next day justin and his mother went shopping for hats and found the perfect one
from then on justin would never take it off and that made his mom roll her eyes
well he got a hat and then he just thought it would get too dirty so he never wore it
cause it so por perfect and then on his next birthday um he put on the hat and it was too tight and so
he couldn't buy another one and he h had to go um get a new one
and he just <br> was really sad because he never wore the hat
and
sil
uh

one day justin and his mother went shopping for hats and his
sil
perfect perfect one
but justin
sil
would never wear the hat and that made his mom
sil
<br> roll
sil
roll her eyes
sil
it wasn't that he didn't like the hat
in fact he loved it
he thought it was great
sil
it totally fit his head
and
sil
h
sil
and it he loved the way it was a little tight at first but then stretched to the perfect size
he loved the color and the color the size the shape
sil
and the
sil
new hat s
sil
smell he even liked the way his hair looked when he took it off
he took the hat off
sil
of unfortunately
sil
justin was too smart
sil
of his own good
he
sil
forgot at that he that the hat would get dry or lost if he wore it too much
sil
so he made a
sil
promise promise to himself that he would never wear it
sil
especially
sil
on special days
sil
he wanted the hat to be clean and
sil
perfect forever
sil
if it gets dry i'll wash it s
sil
silly
sil
said his mother
but i but it'll s shrink if you wash it
sil
and then it'll be too small he said
<br> his father said to h his father said you should really wear the hat if you like
sil
it your size to be
sil
sorry
sil
but justin didn't listen
sil
and everyday the hat s sat on in a
sil
clear
sil
plastic box so
sil
that it wouldn't get dry
sometimes justin would imagine himself walking around around school with the hat on his head
sil
once
sil
he even imagined himself as a grown up
wearing the hat and
sil
speaking in
sil
front of many people
he imagined the people
sil
whispering to themselves
sil
what a fine s
sil
what a fine speaker he is and such a
sil
handsome hat too
sil
on h his next birthday he decided to wear the hat
sil
he wore many pr he
sil
there were many presents but the only thing that made justin excited
sil
he was
sil
going to wear his hat
sil
he wanted to he went into his room
he went to he room o opened the plastic box
sil
and looked and took the h hat out very carefully
then he softly
sil
slid it on
sil
it was a little t tight at first like it was supposed t to be
it was just like he remembered
sil
he was so happy that he couldn't help help but smiling
sil
now i know it's just a hat he thought to himself
but i sure do love it
but then he noticed that it wasn't s stretching
sil
something was wrong
sil
it was a little tight justin could
tell it just wasn't perfect anymore
he knew
sil
caring wouldn't help
sil
wouldn't help make the hat
sil
perfect again
he couldn't anyway
sil
i want to return them all and try to find a new perfect hat instead
his
sil
parents looked
sil
at each other
and
sil
knew that justin had
sil
learned a good lesson
sil
son we would be happy to buy you a new hat but only if you promise to wear it
the father said
justin replied i promise that
sil
if we find the perfect hat i'll wear it everyday
so the next day justin and his mother went shopping for hats
sil
and found the perfect one
from then on justin wore
would wear never take off
take it off
and that made his mom
sil
roll her eyes
um
sil
it was about a boy and a hat and the boy wouldn't wear the hat
sil
um until his birthday and at his birthday he
sil
just
sil
found out that it didn't fit anymore and so his mom and him went back and got him a new hat that was just perfect
sil
and the boy um
sil
learned a good lesson
sil
that you should
sil
even if you um don't want anything to be ruined you have to

racer the dog
when his owners got got him a puppy all he wanted to do was run and run so his owners named him racer
then when he got older he developed problems with his back legs
every time he ran he would limp but
but that didn't stop him from running because like most dogs racer loved to run
there was a dog park near where he lived
he enjoyed playing at the dog park because it didn't have to be on a le leash when he was there so he could run as much as he liked
there was a dog at the dog park named fang
he would always come up to racer and bite his back legs and run away saying bark bark bark bark
which is which in dog talk means you are too slow to catch me with that limp of yours
so i'm going to pick on you
racer would a would ch always chase fang but th he could never catch him
one day racer went to the vet
racer liked the vet because the people in the white coats gave him treats
racer didn't know it but he was at the vet to
sil
have surgery to fix his legs
when he woke up from the surgery surgery he didn't even remember where he was but soon his owners came and drove him home
on a on the drive home racer realized that his legs itched very badly
he thought oh boy i'm going to lick my leg so hard that the itch is itching is going to go away
so he turned his head around to lick his leg but there was a big white thing in his way
he was wearing a collar that made i it impossible to lick his legs
a few days later he he went with his owners to the dog park
racer had to to be on the leash since he still needed to heal from his surgery
but it was nice to see all his friends
mean old fang said bark bark bark bark
which meant why don't you have to
do you have to wear that stupid looking c collar it sure does look silly
eventually racer didn't h have to wear the collar but then his legs itch so he didn't want to lick them
for six weeks rac racer would take walks and go to the dog park but still had to be on a leash
sil
one day he took a walk to the dog park and all his friends were there as usual
then his owners reached around his neck and took off his leash
just then fang fang bit him on the back leg and ran away
racer's owners said go run
so racer started running and chasing fang
fang was laughing because he knew racer could never catch him
but suddenly he noticed that racer was catching up to him
racer was running faster than he could ever remember before he knew he knew it he had caught up to fang and knocked him down
racer said bark bark which which in dog talk means don't pick on me any more fang
and from that day on fang never bit racer's le
sil
racer's legs
um <br>
sil
he loved to run like all dogs did and
sil
<br> um soon he had a pr problem with his legs and a dog named fang kept on coming and biting him and saying bark bark bark bark which meant um
sil
y you are limping so i can pick on you and
sil
and then he went to the vet and he liked the vet and he didn't know he was getting surgery and when he woke up he didn't knew w where he was
<br>
and then
sil
um
sil
and then <br> he his owners came and drive drove him home and <br> his legs were itchy so he tried to lick them but he had a um white collar on that stopped him from itching and
when he went to the park <br> i fang bit him in the leg and <br> he said bark bark which meant um
sil
that's a wierd collar and you still have a limp and <br> i can still pick on you and then um
the a few days later they brought him back and <br> fang came up and bit him and
sil
and he ran away and then they said that he could run and he caught up with fang and then he came back to his owners <br> and gave them kisses

when the drive to mesa verde was eight hours long we went to see ruins like eagles nest balcony house and spruce tree house we had to go to bed at eight and wake up at six <unk> i liked the walk to balcony house and the and it was fun going up the ladder
sil
dear mom and dad
since you have grounded me and told me to write down why i am <unk> sorry before i was allowed out of my room i am mad at you
i would like to start by saying that i think that you are very mean
sil
<unk> to make me do this because i wa it wasn't even my fault
i couldn't help it anyways it was an accident and i didn't even do it on purpose
i really didn't mean to sh shave the cat really i swear i swear
ok
<br>
heres what happened as i remember it
i saw that the cat was trying t to get the gerbils and you told us we couldn't hit animals so what <unk> so i didn't know what else to do
so i grabbed dad's nose hair clippers and shaved it
i should have
sil
you should be proud of me
sil
for thinking so fast on my toes
sil
<unk> oh sure it's easy to say that i should have just picked up the cat but those stupid gerbils didn't even thank me
they just ran on that stupid wheel
sil
and did stupid things that's the last time i shave the cat to protect any stupid gerbils
besides the real reason i shaved the cat was to keep it nice and cool
i just didn't want to see the cat getting all hot and uncomfortable and stuff
you guys will just probably say it's winter danny cats don't overheat in winter
but so what if it's winter i mean it'll be summer soon enough and i just wanted the cat to get used to the idea before it got really hot
plus <unk> oscar my turtle told me to shave the cat
<unk> fine oscar can't really talk but if he could he would have said please shave the cat
if it keeps hitting me on the shell and trying to roll me over when i leave the room you guys you guys never liked oscar as much as the cat anyway
you wouldn't always take the cat's side if you knew the stuff he did to my poor turtle
cats aren't aren't always nice just like my sister jenny isn't always nice
sil
but the realest reason i shaved my shaved the cat was to make a wig for
<unk>
those poor hair less cats that we saw on tv on the animal channel
i knew our cat would grow her fur back but some cats don't have hair
<unk> they are call called hairless cats
they need f fur in the winter because i th think i swear that's the reason
also i was going to sell the cat fur to buy my sister's jenny braces for her big stupid face
<br> plus i forgot to tell you that you should be blaming ms casper my science teacher
she made us shave some something for science ask her
she said that when we shave a cat a lot of a bunch of times her hair would grow back harder each time and soon
sil
you could take her on tv shows and get lots of money so that you can send jenny to college even if she is dumb li is a dumb little tattle tale
she's so good at school and you bought her a cat cause she's so responsible and stuff
just cause she's a good student didn't mean she's doesn't
sil
didn't mean she's really responsible
last night i saw that she didn't brush her teeth oh yeah i forgot to tell you you that
dear mom and dad jenny didn't brush her teeth last night
<unk> i think sh she should brush h t brush her teeth twice tonight thats just my opinion though
i bet you didn't know something else did you know i wanted to be a barber
i was afraid to tell you the r really re the really reason i shaved the cat was that i want to be a barber i need practice
<br> i was afraid you wouldn't let me practice on my own head can i can practice by shaving jenny's head
i promise i'll do a better job then i did on the cat cause now i have what dad calls life experience
not that i shaved the cat though
<unk> actually the truth is that i i by accident turned on the nose hair clipper
and the cat was being chased by the turtle that ran right by the clippers and shaved herself
i kept saying no kitty no don't shave yourself
but my stupid sister never taught her cat how to listen so she just ignored me
she she's not so responsible after all
if she <unk> if i had a cat i would teach her how to not i would to not shave itself that's for sure
i don't have a good get i don't have to get good grades to know <unk> that you should teach a cat to shave itself
sil
<unk> plus if it weren't anyways cuddling with my sister so much maybe <unk> maybe she would have been enough
sil
the cat liked being shaved anyway so it didn't it do i don't see the big
sil
i don't see the big deal
i think
sil
i think it really liked it's haircut
the only reason it hasn't <unk> come out for two weeks is because you guys made such a big deal about it
poor kitty this and poor kitty that
it's your fault really dad please don't read the next part
<br> dear mom want dad know that the real reason i shaved the cat was that he's really sneeze sneezing around
i know how much you hate him any always sneezing and stuff
so i thought i'd get rid of his fur he wouldn't sneeze and that you would have a better marriage
so it was really my father's day gift to him
i couldn't buy him anything nice since it took away my allowance for when i shaved the neighbor's dog
sil
<unk> how come jenny gets a cat and i get a stupid turtle anyway
turtles don't do anything except poke their heads out and be not cuddly
sil
can i get a dog
sil
get a dog please
so in conclusion i'm getting hungry and sorry for shaving the cat
ps if you would have brought her a a turtle i could've shaved it
sil
shaved it
sincerely danny
well it's it's about a kid who shaves his sister's cat so he gets grounded and sent to his room
and he's writing a letter to his mom and dad <br> to tell them it was an accident
and he has like all these different reasons that <br> he why he did it and
sil
<br> and he wa and he in the end he's asking them for a dog
sil
and so that's
sil
<br> a sh mm
sil
and <br> h in one part he he writes his mom and dad about uh uhm that says his big his big or little sister i don't know which one <br> didn't brush her teeth
the last night so uhm he thinks she should brush her teeth twice that night <br> uhm
sil
uhm and that's really all
sil
one was his turtle was chasing the cat and he k and he turned on the nose razor which <br> and the cat kept running by and shaving itself that was one of it's exc <br> his excuses
sil
and the second one was that they were trying to get h he was they were trying to get the gerbil he was trying to get the gerbil <br> another one um was that it was gonna it was a father's day present to his dad because the cat was always sneezing so he thought he'd shave off off all the fur
<br> and then tho those are really all the <br> ones i remember

justin and his hat
one day justin and his mother went shopping for hats and found the perfect one but justin would never wear the hat and made his mother roll her eyes
sil
it wasn't that he didn't like the hat in fact he loved it he thought it was great
it totally fit his head he loved the way it was a little tight at first but then stretched to the perfect size
<unk> he loved the color and size and shape the shape and
sil
the new
sil
hat smell he even liked the way his hair looked when he took the hat off
unfortunately justin was too smart for his own good
he figured out that the hat would get dirty or lost if he wore it too much
sil
so he made a promise to himself that he would never wear it except on special days
he wanted the hat to be clean and perfect forever
if it gets dirty i'll wash it silly said his mother
but it'll shrink if you wash it and then it'll be too small he said
his father said you should really wear the hat if you like it or else you'll be sorry
but justin didn't listen and everyday the hat stayed in a clear plastic box so that it wouldn't get dirty
sometimes justin would imagine himself walking around school with the hat on his head
once <unk> he even imagined himself as a grown up wearing the hat and speaking in front of many people
he imagined the people whispering to themselves what a fine speaker he said he is
sil
and such a handsome hat too
sil
on his next birthday he decided to wear the hat
sil
there were many presents but the only thing that made justin excited was getting to wear his hat
he went to his room opened the plastic box and took the hat out very carefully then he slowly slid it on
sil
it was a little tight at first
sil
like it was supposed to be it was just like he remembered he was so happy that he couldn't help but smile
i know it's just a hat he thought to himself but i sure do love it but then he noticed that it wasn't stretching
something was wrong it was a little tight justin could tell it wasn't perfect anymore
sil
he knew crying wouldn't make the hat perfect again but he cried away
he told his parents i don't want any of those gifts i want to return them all and try to find a new perfect hat instead
his parents looked at each other <unk> and knew that justin had learned a good lesson
son we would be happy to buy you a new hat but only if you promise to wear it the father said
justin replied <unk> i promise that if <unk> we find the perfect hat i'll wear it everyday
so the next day justin and his mother went shopping for hats and found the perfect one
<unk> from then on justin would never take it off and that made his mom roll her eyes
sil
i think this story is about a kid named justin and he has this hat that
sil
he would never wear except for on special occasions and days and stuff
so
sil
on his birthday
sil
he wore the hat and it was a little tight at first but then after a little while he found out that the hat was too small
sil
and he went down to his parents and told him that the hat was too small
sil
and
sil
then
sil
uhm
sil
h he wanted to returned the presents that his friends got him and
sil
uhm get a new prefect hat
sil
so the day after his birthday him and his mom went shopping and they got another perfect hat
well this story well i think the story is about
sil
uhm this kid named danny who got grounded for shaving his cat
sil
and he was telling tons of different things about why he shaved the cat that weren't really true in the story
sil
and
sil
he was saying that his sister was like really
sil
unresponsible and she didn't brush her teeth
sil
and she didn't play with her cat and stuff
so and we wanted to be a barber so
sil
he shaved the cat

justin and his hat sil
one day justin and his mother went shopping for hats and found the perfect one but justin would never wear that hat sil the hat and that made his mom roll her eyes
it <unk> wasn't that he didn't like the hat in fact he loved it he thought it was great it was t totally fit his head
he loved the way it was a little tight at first but he stretched it to the perfect size
he loved the color sil the size the shape and the new hat smell
he even liked the way his hair looked when
sil he figured out that the hat would get dirty or lost if he wore it too much so he made his promise to himself that he would never wear it except on special days
he wanted the hat to be clean and perfect forever
if it gets dirty i'll wash it silly said his mother
but it'll shrink if you wash it and then it'll it'll be too too small he said <unk> sil
his father said you should really wear that hat if you like it or else you'll be sorry
but justin didn't listen and everyday the hat sat in a clear p plastic box so that it wouldn't get dirty
sometimes justin would imagine himself walking around school with the hat on his head
once he even imagined himself as a grown up wearing the hat and speaking in front of many people
he imagined the people whispering to themselves what what a fine speaker he is and such a handsome hat too
on his birthday he decided to wear the hat
there were many presents but the only thing that made justin excited was getting to wear the hat
he went to his room opened the plastic box and took the hat out carefully then he showed he slowly slid it on
it was a little tight at first like it it was supposed to be
it was just like he remembered he was so happy and he couldn't help but smile
i know it's just a hat he thought to himself but i i sure love it sil but he then he noticed that it wasn't stretching sil
something was wrong it was a little tight justin could tell it it just wasn't perfect anymore
he knew he knew crying wouldn't help the hat perfect hat again but he
he cried anyways he told his parents i don't want any of those gifts i i want to return them all and try to find a new perfect hat instead
his parents looked at each other and knew that justin had learned a good lesson
son we would be happy to buy you a new hat but only if you promise to wear it said father
justin replied i po i promise that if we find the perfect hat i'll wear it everyday
<br> so the next day justin and his mother went shopping for hats
he found the perfect one from then on justin would never take it off and that that made his mother roll her eyes <unk>
um the story was about a boy who who got a hat and he
he thought it was the best hat
and he wanted he um <br> and it was the best hat it it fit him perfectly and everything <br> then he didn't want to get it dirty so <br> he put it in a little plastic box and kept it there <br>
only for he would alone wear it on special occasions
he didn't want to get it dirty or anything
<br> and um so sil <unk> he wa um one one day it was his birthday and he wanted he wanted to wear the hat
<br> he was so exicted and then he put it on <br> and it was small it didn't stretch it didn't fit anymore
<br> and then so then <br> he didn't want the presents anymore and <br> and sil and s and then he went to buy a hat with his mother
and then that's and then he must have learned the lesson to wear the hat like
the um like if you got one <br> instead of putting and keep it there and you're not using it if you just put it in a plastic box

one day justin and his mother went shopping for hats
and found a the perfect one but justin would never wear the hat and that made his mother his mom roll her eyes
it wasn't that he didn't like the hat in fact he loved it he thought it was great
it totally fit his head he loved the way it was a little tight at first
but then stretched to perfect size
he loved the color the size the shape sil
the new hat smell sil he even liked the way his hair looked when he took off the hat
unfortunately justin was too smart for his own good
he figured out that the hat would get dirty or lost if he wore it too much
he had made a promise to himself that he would never wear it except on special days
he wanted the hat to be clean and perfect forever
if it gets dirty i'll wash it silly said his mother
but it'll shrink if you wash it sil and then it'll be too small he said
his father said you should really wear that hat if you like it or else you'll be sorry
but justin didn't listen and everyday the hat sat in a clear plastic box so that it wouldn't get dirty
sometimes justin would imagine himself walking around the school with the hat on his head
once he even imagined himself as a grown up wearing the hat
and speaking in front of many people
he imagined that people whispering to themselves
what a fine speaker he is and such a handsome hat too
on his next birthday he decided to wear the hat
there were many presents but the only thing that made justin excited was getting to wear his hat
he went to his room opened the plastic box and took the hat out very carefully then he slowly slid it on
it was a little tight at first like it was supposed to be
it was just like he had remembered
it was so happy that he couldn't help but smile
i know it's just a hat he thought to himself but i sure do love it
but then he noticed that it wasn't stretching
something was wrong it was a little tight
justin couldn't tell sil tell it just wasn't perfect anymore
he knew crying wouldn't help make the hat perfect again but he cried anyway
he told his parents i don't want any of those gifts i want to return them and try to find a new perfect hat instead
his parents looked at each other and knew that justin had learned a good lesson
son we would be happy to buy you a new hat if sil if you promise to wear it the father said
justin replied i promise that if we find the perfect hat i'll wear it everyday
so the next day justin and his mother went shopping for hats and found the perfect one
from then on justin would never take it off and that made his mom sil roll her eyes
well sil it was about a kid who got a new hat with um
<br> and it was an elastic hat and um he really really liked it and he said to his mom it's perfect and he said to himself it's perfect um but he never wore it cause thought it would get dirty
sil and just because a hat's going to get dirty doesn't mean you can't wear it
<br> and so one day when he was going to put it on for his birthday he noticed that it didn't stretch and he didn't know what was causing it but it was probably because he grew
and the hat didn't fit him any more

he figured out that the hat would get dirty or lost if he wore it too much so he made a promise to himself that he would never wear it exc except on special days
he wanted the hat to be clean and perfect forever
if it gets dirty i'll wash it silly said his mother
but it'll shrink if you wash it and then it'll be too small he said
his father said you should really wear the hat if you like it or else you will be sorry
but justin didn't lis listen and everyday the hat sat in a clear plastic box so that it wouldn't get dirty
<br> sometimes justin would j imagine himself walking around school with his hat on his head
<br> once he even imagined himself himself as a grown up wearing the hat and speaking in front of many people
he imagined the people whispering to themselves
<br> what a fine speaker he is and such a handsome hat too
<br> on his next birthday he decided to wear the hat
there were many presents but the only thing that made justin exc excited was getting to wear his hat
he went to his room opened the plastic box and took the hat out very carefully then he slowly slid it on on
it was a little tight at first like it was supposed to be
it was just like he remembered he was so happy that he couldn't help but smile
i know it's just a hat he thought to himself but i sure do love it
but then he noticed that it wasn't stretching
something was wrong it was a little tight
justin could tell it was just wasn't perfect anymore
he knew crying wouldn't help make that hat hat perfect again but he cried anyway
he told his parents i don't want any of those gifts
i want to return them all and try to find a new perfect hat instead
his parents looked at each other and knew that justin had learned a good lesson

racer the dog
when his owners got him as a puppy all he wanted to do was run and run so his owners named him racer
then when he got older he developed problems with his back legs
every time he ran he would limp but that didn't stop him f from running because like most dogs racer loved to run
there was a dog park near where he lived
he enjoyed playing at the dog park because he didn't have to be on his leash
when he was there so he could run as much as he liked
<br> there was one dog at the park
sil
dog park named fang he would always come up to racer and bite his back legs and run away saying bark bark bark bark
with his dog talk means
you are too slow to c catch me with that limp of yours so i'm going to pick on you
racer would always chase fang but he could never catch him
one day racer went to the vet
racer liked the vet because the people in the white coats gave him treats
racer didn't know it but he was at the vet to have surgery to fix his legs
sil
when he woke up from the surgery he didn't even remember where he was but soon his owners came and drove him home
on the drive home racer realized that his legs itched very badly
he thought oh boy i'm going to lick my leg so hard that the itching is going to go away
sil
so he turned his head around to lick his legs but there was a big white thing in his way
he was wearing a collar that made it impossible to lick his legs
a few days later he went into
sil
he went with his owners to the dog park
racer had to be on the leash since the s he still needed to heal from his surgery but it was nice to see all his friends
sil
mean old fang said bark bark bark bark which meant
sil
why do you have to wear that stupid looking collar it sure does look silly
eventually racer didn't have to wear the collar but by then his legs didn't itch so he didn't want to lick them
for six weeks racer would take walks and go to the dog park but he still had to be on his leash
sil
one day he took a walk to the dog park and all his friends were there as usual
then his owners reached around his neck and took off his leash
just then fang bit him on the back leg and ran away racer's owners said go run so racer started running and chasing fang
fang was laughing because he knew racer could never catch him
but suddenly he noticed that racer was catching up to him
racer was running faster than he could ever remember and before he knew it he had caught up to fang and knocked him down
racer said bark bark which in dog talk means
don't pick on me any more fang
and from that day on fang never bit racer's legs
racer was so happy that he could run fast that he ran and ran in circles
finally he ran back to his owners and gave them big kisses for fixing his legs
um it was about a dog named racer and he liked to run a lot and his back legs had problems and
but he still liked to run and then he went to the vet and got his legs fi fixed
and um fang was another dog and he liked to pick on racer because um he knew that racer couldn't run very fast
and at the end of the story after racer got his legs fixed um he caught fang and
sil
um told fang never to pick on him again and fang then didn't

fang was laughing because he knew racer would never catch him
but suddenly he noticed racer was catching up with him
racer was running faster than he could ever remember and before he knew it he had caught up with fang and knocked him down
racer said bark bark which meant dumb
which in dog talk meant don't pick on me any more fang and from that day fang never bit racer's legs
finally he
sil
ran back to his owners and gave them a big kiss for fixing his legs
the end
well it was about this dog that had a problem with his hindlegs
<br> and one day he went to the vet
<br> and he had his legs fixed fixed by having surgery
<br>
and then he the dog r called racer really liked
<br>
um being able to run fast in the end
sil
ts that's more or less what happened
sil
fang um was really mean to racer because he couldn't run fast and he a always would limp when he ran
sil
fang was mean to him probably because he was um <br> he wasn't um racer wasn't like fang
sil
and fang he used to um
<br>
bite his legs but then he stopped when racer caught up with him in a running in a race sort of

racer the dog
when his owners got him as a puppy all
sil
all he wanted to do was run and run so his owner named him racer
when then when he got older he developed problems wi with his back legs
every time he ran he would limp but that didn't stop him from running because like most dogs racer loved to run
there was a dog park near where he lived
he enjoyed playing at the dog park because he didn't have to be on a leash when he was there so could he be much as like
sil
there were there was one dog at the dog park named fang
he would always come up to racer and bite his back legs
and run away saying bark bark bark bark
sil
which in dog talk means you are too slow to catch me with
sil
that limp of yours
sil
i'm going to pick you pick on you
racer would always chase fangs but he would never catch him
<br> one day racer went to the vet
racer liked the vet because the people in the white coats gave him treats
racer didn't know h know it but he was the vet
he was at the vet to have surgery to fix his legs
sil
when he woke up the surgery didn't even rem
sil
the surgery he didn't even remember when he was
sil
but soon he w owner came and drove him home
w on the drive racer realized that his legs
sil
itched very badly
sil
he thought oh boy i'm going to lick my leg so hard
sil
that the itching is going to go away
so he turned his head around licked his legs but there was a big white thing in his way
he was wearing a co wearing a collar made it impossible to lick his legs
sil
a few days later he went with his owner to the dog park
racer had to be on the leash since he was still needed to heal his from his surgery
but it was
sil
nice to see all his friends
sil
mean old
sil
mean old fa fang said bark bark bark which meant
why do you have to wear that stupid looking collar
it sure does look silly
eventually racer didn't have to wear the collar but the legs didn't itch so he didn't want to lick them
for six weeks racer would take walks on and go to the dog park but still had to be on a leash
sil
one day he he took a walk to the dog park and all his friends were there as
sil
sil
as usual
the his owner reached around his neck and took off his leash
just then fang bit him in the back of leg and ran away racer
sil
racer's owner said go run so racer started running chasing fang
fang was laughing because he knew racer would never catch him
but suddenly he noticed that racer was catching up to him
racer was running faster than he could ever remember that
sil
remember that before he knew it he had caught up to fang and knocked him down
racer said bark bark which in dog talk means don't pick on me any more fang
and from that day on fang never bit racer's leg
racer was so happy that he could run fast that he ran and ran in circles
finally he ran back to his owner and gave him big kisses for fixing his legs
the end
um racer used to be a really fast dog and then he started to limp
and i think he started to limp by because fang kept on biting him in the leg and it <br> might have broke up his muscles or something <br> and um
sil
i thought the story was <br> um a good story because
sil
it just was pretty good

the airplane ride
the first time i ever took an airplane by myself it was fun and scary
i didn't know anyone at all and had to go all the way from new york to texas without my parents
i was going there to see my grandfather we were going to go fishing
i've always thought flying was fun
you go higher than any mountain and you go faster than any car
but to tell you the truth without my parents there i was pretty nervous
i guess it was because the plane was so loud and i didn't know anyone
i was starting
sil
thinking we might crash
sil
oh i started thinking we might crash
sil
<br> i didn't like to think about that but i couldn't help it that's when i missed my parents the most
once the plane was in the air i was pretty good
my mom gave me a coloring book of cool looking dragons to keep me busy i colored the dragon pictures all green so it didn't take very long
i only used the green crayon because
sil
it was
sil
because it was the tallest and i wanted it to catch up to the red brown blue yellow purple and black ones
sil
one thing about being by yourself on an airplane
is that the flight attendants are very nice to you
i had seven cola's and four ginger ale's by the time
sil
wait
sil
which made me have to go to the bathroom eight times
i was glad that there wasn't anyone next to me
the person next to me would have been very annoyed
sil
even the flight attendant seemed a little annoyed that i had to go to the bathroom so much but it was her fault
for some reason she kept trying to give me peanuts
but i told her that i would like a banana split instead
she said they don't have any banana banana splits on the plane but sometimes people like to eat peanuts on their banana splits
i told her that it was the peanuts that were making me so thirsty in the first place
and that if she would
get me a banana split i wouldn't have to go the bathroom so much
she told me to be quiet and watch the movie
i tried to watch the movie
but i had already seen that one so it was boring
the flight attendant gave me a deck of cards but she wouldn't play go fish with me
she said that she had to help other passengers
sil
i had a game boy in my backpack my backpack was in the overhead thingy
sil
i tried to push the button that lights up so the flight attendant would come but guess what i was too short to reach the button
so i started yelling hey peanut lady hey peanut lady
she didn't like being called peanut lady
but she did get me my game boy
she told me to call her jennifer instead
i played on my game boy until i got my new high score
then jennifer came up to me and said she had a surprise i thought great more peanuts
but it wasn't peanuts it was something really cool
she said the captain was inviting me to see the cockpit i thought awesome
i also brought my deck of cards in case the pilot was bored and wanted to play go fish
jennifer took me into the cockpit pit and there
sil
and there were like a million buttons and levers and knobs and stuff
suddenly i thought wow look at all of those buttons
then i thought there's no way that anyone can remember to push all those buttons at the right time
we are going to crash
sil
the way i figured it my game boy
only has five buttons and i can't get past level three
imagine how hard it would be to work all those millions of buttons and eat peanuts and go to the bathroom
the pilot told me that it wasn't really that hard once you practiced
then he told me that he once played a game
and i h
i had on my game boy and he couldn't even pass level one
i said if you can't get past level one
and you can be a pilot then i could be a pilot too since i'm much better at pushing buttons than you are
he laughed even though i wasn't joking
<br> he said he thought i would make a great pilot someday if i wanted to be
he was really nice but he wouldn't play go fish with me
finally we landed
that's always scary because it seems like even though you are
we were on the
we are on the ground
but the plane is going to
f
is going too fast to ever stop
sil
finally we landed
that's always scary because it seems like even though we were
on the ground
that the plane is going too fast to ever stop
but it did
when i got off the airplane there was grandpa waiting for me he said how was your flight
i said someday i'm going to be a pilot
and i'll only serve banana splits on my plane
<br> grandpa laughed then took me straight to the ice cream shop
it was worth the whole trip just to eat a banana split with grandpa
the story's about uhm this boy and he's going on the airplane for the first time alone <br>
and uhm <br> he talks about how the flight attendant keeps on trying to give him peanuts instead of what he wants a banana split
and uhm he's kind of bored he colors and
and tri and he plays his gameboy but he doesn't he isn't able to get to the highest level only level three <br>
and then uhm he gets to go into the cockpit and talk <br> to the pilot and uhm <br>
he wants the pilot to play with him go fish but <br> the pilot can't play <br>
and uhm and then when he finally lands he's really scared about the landing but then it's over and he meets his grandpa and tells him he wants to be a pilot when he's older and
then he goes to the ice cream shop and gets a banana split <br>
after the usual ceremonies the prince presented <unk> his proposal <unk>
rather would f i face three strong men than one young damsel
i would love dearly to hear these people describe their travels
sil
throughout these conversations sam hodge seldom spoke
now he has gone off again for the game is getting scarce
yes my lord said the man his sunburned face reddening
even if there has been some little mistake what could i do now to fix it
for several days this strangely assorted pair roamed the jungle together
the earl looked at it and the corners of his mouth twitched
for you and me there is nothing to hope for nothing beyond what we have
if god spares beth i never will complain again m whispered meg earnestly
these thoughts haunted him all day and he dreamt them all night
for nothing brings joy to the heart like the coming of spring
she could see nothing except the morning glories which covered the side of the porch
we never knew that such strange people existed anywhere in the world
she must begin with the chinese dynasty <unk> and the end it japan with japan
in the deep gloom she could not see the anger which darkened his face
diana searched faithfully but no axe was to be found in the whole woodshed
she wants to give that boy an extremely bad opinion of me
sil
i know the county stock law just as well as you do
how strange that a live animal should grow on a stalk like a flower
i guess i'll buy a few snakes since they look so funny coiling out
sil
see the wisdom of my choice he said holding up the large leaf of gold
but i am too old to endure your shame and misery much longer
sil
rooster john
before i tell you
how rooster john got his name
you should know a little bit about the town of franksville
<br> franksville was a town that seemed to have one problem after the other
<br> their problems started when they ran out of water
<br> thankfully when someone was digging a hole and found water
<br> but soon after that they started to get flies
they got tons and tons of flies
then the flies stopped
sil
but just then a man moved to town playing a flute so badly that the people would run away screaming
sil
why don't you
why did they
sil
ever invent ears
maybe a poorly played flute doesn't sound all that bad
but just try to imagine someone scratching a chalkboard
with a fork and then multiply that times a hundred
that's how the flute sounded when this guy played it
<br> i'm serious
still it's not as bad as a million flies i suppose
the flute the bad flute player was rooster john
it wa he wasn't called rooster john yet
that came later
he was the new town dentist
he was an exc excellent dentist
sil
but his real love was music
he played many musical instruments such as the guitar tuba and the piano and the clarinet
but for some reason
the way his mouth was shaped made the flute sound so bad that
his fish would jump out of their fish bowl
sil
we can't let you play the flute anymore john said the police chief sanders
the neighbors are complaining and the cats and dogs are trying to chew off their ears
but i have to play i was born to do it i don't know why
but i feel like i have to or else i'm
else something bad will happen
<br> look john i've heard you play the clarinet you're quite good
why don't you play that instead the police said the police sanders
oh that's a nice instrument but it's not the flute
i wrote you a song with the flute called
cops and robbers then he played the song for police sanders
the police hated the sound so much that he threw john in jail
<br> but they couldn't keep john in jail since
sil
the
sil
wasn't really breaking any
sil
laws so there was nothing
sil
<unk> so should i start here
sil
<br> since he wasn't really breaking any laws
so there is nothing that the police could do
besides everyone loved john
since he had become the town dentist everybody's teeth were much whiter and cleaner
and no one had any cavities
<br> so there is a problem
in the little town of franksville what should they do
they couldn't keep john in jail
they didn't want to kick him out of the town because they
all had such nice teeth
so they decided that john could play the flute and everybody else would have to wear earplugs
<br> well i'm sure you guessed that didn't work
no one could hear anything people were getting into car accidents and
sil
<unk> and <unk>
everybody looked really silly at dances
dancing to music that they couldn't really hear
<br> they just couldn't read lead a normal life
sil
then they decided to lower him down in a well and let him play where no one could hear him
john thought that was an ok idea but there is s
an echo in the well that made the flute sound louder
windows were breaking and all the cows in town started to make sour milk
<br> the local
especially shaped for john's mouth then perhaps he could play the flute normally
guess what it worked
doctor wrong wrong was
sil
the town hero
<br> the flute sounded normal and it turned out that john could play it quite well
<br> the people in the town decided to have a great big parade in franksville to celebrate the fact that
for once there was no water problem no fly problem and no flute problem
sil
doctor wrong and john were the stars of the parade
so they were on the main float
<br> a big band band played as they marched up and down main street everyone cheered
sil
then suddenly a fly landed on a little girl and then
uhm another on a lil on a big girl
sil
then one landed on everyone
sil
then two landed on everyone
soon t then soon tons of flies
sil
were landing on everyone
before they knew it the town was filled with flies again
oh no said the police sanders
just when things were going good for franksville
<br> john didn't know what to do so he kept playing his flute
the flies were so annoying so he would swat at them with his hand
sil
or even
sil
with his new flute
he started shaking the flute to get the flies off
and accidentally smashed it into pieces he was very upset at first then he said oh well good thing i brought my old flute as a back up
sil
no no please don't play your old flute begged doctor wrong
but it was too late john had started playing
when the townsfolks heard the noise they couldn't even swat at the flies anymore
<br> they had to cover their ears from the horrible sound
the flies would land all over the people and they couldn't swat them off
it was gross then suddenly the flies flew away fast as they could
it's the flute song the flies hate
john's flute playing as much as we do
sil
john was the dentist john the dentist is driving away the flies
sil
it was then the people of franksville realized that they had
would have to take the good with the bad
because as bad as the flute sounded it was a lot better than the thousands of flies crawling on them
from then on john would wake up at sunrise like a rooster and play to keep the flies away
uhm well in rooster john they uhm the guy played the flute really badly
and so the flies went away and then and everybody hated the flute so they had to plug their ears and then uhm
one day doctor wong found a way to make the flute sound better and then all the flies came back
and uhm rooster john
sil
broke his new flute and so he played and old one again and all the flies went away
so everybody was happy that flies went away but not exactly happy with the sound so then uhm he just uhm woke up every morning like a rooster to play his flute to make the flies go away
sil
uhm they wanted they decided that everyone should wear earplugs but that didn't really work because then they couldn't really hear the music they were dancing to <br>
and then they also put john in jail but that didn't work cause he couldn't really be in jail for playing a flute badly
and so uhm they didn't really work i don't know
<br> the red leaves were burner blown around in millions by the wind
behind lay the ship a picture not without its lighter side
and meanwhile by the f f further river bank came rosalind with mushrooms in in her skirt
sil
now go and answer your note and let me finish this s splendid story
more courage than my poor brother who stands here there like a c coward
she rushed frantic frantically across the ap apartment seized her hood and ran from the cottage
sil
they carry themselves a as if they had been drilled both men and women
lindy not being overburdened with perception did not see this
the day ethel brown was seven years old she had a tea party
i fear that we shall have another smart gale however it won't last long
sil
of course there's nothing very entertaining here for you
the youngster lingered for a moment or two watching myles at his work
sil
these words <unk> quite destroyed the hope of that of late had growing within her within her
its flavor when cook cooked is more exquisite f far than mutton or oysters or eggs
i'm in earnest huck just as earnest as ever i was in my life
seagrave melt knelt by his side took took his hand and burst into tears
nan said it wouldn't grow in our garden but i brought some home to try
his boots creaked too so loudly but still he was not at all afraid
sil
sh she will be glad to see you but she has been very badly frightened
he took his back he turned his back on the boy c c conferred aside with lawrence
i desired it so much that i will take no refusal <unk>
the prize cup grew clearer and nearer to he to her mental vision
the airplane ride
the first time i ever took an airplane by myself it was fun and scary
<br> i don't know i didn't know anyone at all an

sil
grandpa laughed and then took me straight to the ice cream shop it was worth the whole trip just to eat a banana split with grandpa
uhm i thought the story was like kind of funny in that he he wanted a banana split on the airplane
and that he uh called the lady a peanut lady and wanted to know if the pilot would have time to play go fish even though he was flying the plane to make sure it didn't crash which he was afraid of
sil
and uh
sil
<br> this kid gets on the plane
and he's kind of scared that it might crash and the flight attendant is kind of nice even though she gets annoyed that he has to go to the bathroom
he has to go to he bathroom a lot cause he's giving her a lot of peanuts peanuts and the peanuts are making him thirsty
<br> so he drank like four cokes and three ginger ales or something like that
and then the flight attendant gave gave him a deck of cards and he wanted her to play go fish with her but he wouldn't
and then he wanted to get his gameboy out of the overhead compartment so he called called the flight attendant the
sil
peanut lady but uh and she she came over and was like don't call me peanut lady my name is jennifer
then he got it down and he got a new hi score on whatever game it was he had in that gameboy
then uhm then little while later the the flight attendant er jennifer came in as told him that the pilot wanted him to come up into the uh cockpit and
so he did and he was like pretty amazed at all like the the buttons and the levers and the things and he thought they were going to crash because th he thought there was no way that the somebody could con control all those buttons at the right time
sil
so then finally they landed and his grandpa was there and they went and they w and they went to uh go get a banana split at the ice cream shop
the earl's next speech dashed that hope into a thousand fragments
sil
the next moment he changed the subject because it seemed the best thing to do
harrison chuckled a if he chuckled at all in private and and was all sympathy outward
sil
hearing tho hearing these words jim resolved to conquer his alarm by himself
<br> then he seemed to breathe more fiercely and recovered some of his jaunty imp impudence
sil
then the ropes were attached and everybody pulled vigorously
not even her wrath at the girl's insolence could wholly overcome her wonder
the mistress stood stock tall holding her hands level at level with her throat
the women replied only by vanishing as though suddenly mixed with a the air
she loosened the she had loosened the lid and then she lau laughingly sat on it
i should think you had an imagination sure enough she laughed
do you know why i asked her to send me the manuscript
bouncer had passed a sleepless night and quarreled again at breakfast
there jo was mistaken for next day she made a discovery which produced a tempest
dusky crimson rushed madly over the boy's face
sil
isn't he known as the most brilliant journalist in new york
why i'm hardly acquainted with you cried anne in indignantly
i swore to bring you the terrible head and see how i keep my oath
all night the blizzard raged and in the morning the plains were white with snow
now all the people rejoiced because the wicked king should rule them no longer
gracious ain't that awful an awful lot of money exclaimed davy crockett
sil
this little john did though without disturbing his master or rising from where he sat
sil
before i tell you how rooster john got his name
you should know a little bit about the town of franksville
franksville was a town that seemed to have one problem after the other
their problems started when they ran out of water
thankfully someone was digging a hole and found water
but soon after that they started to get flies
they got tons and tons of flies
then the flies stopped
but just then a man moved into town
who played the flute so badly that
people w would run away screaming
sil
why
oh th
th why did they ever invent ears
sil
maybe a poorly played flute doesn't sound all that bad
but just try to imagine someone scratching a chalkboard with a fork
and then multiply that times a hundred
that's how
sil
that's how the flute sounded when this guy played it
i'm serious
still it's not as bad as millions of flies i suppose
sil
the bad flute player was rooster john
sil
he wasn't called rooster john yet that came later
sil
he was the new town dentist
he was an excellent dentist but his real love was music
sil
he played many musical instruments
such as the guitar
the tuba the piano and the clarinet
but for some reason
the way his <unk> the way his mouth was shaped
sil
made a flute sound as so bad that his fish would jump out of their fish bowl
sil
why can't
sil
we can't let you play the flute anymore john said police chief sanders
sil
the neighbors are complaining and cats
the cats and dogs are trying to chew off their ears
sil
but i have to play
i was born to do it i don't know why
but i feel like i have to do <unk> have to or else bad things will happen
look john
i've heard you play the clarinet
you're quite good why don't you play that instead
said police chief sanders
oh that's a nice instrument but it's just not the flute
sil
i wrote you a song on the flute it's called cops and robbers
then he played the song for police chief sanders
the police chief hated the sound so much that he threw john in jail
sil
but they couldn't keep
sil
john in jail since he wasn't really breaking any laws so there was nothing the police could do
besides everybody loved john
since he
sil
be <unk>
since he had become the town dentist everybody's teeth were much whiter and cleaner and nobody <unk> an
no one had any cavities
sil
<unk> so there was a problem in the tow little town of franksville
what should they do
sil
they could keep <unk> they couldn't keep john in jail
and they didn't want to kick him out of town because they all had such nice teeth
so they decided that
sil
john could play the flute and everyone else would have <unk>
to wear earplugs
sil
well i'm sure
you guessed that didn't work
no one could hear anything people were getting in car accidents and
sil
<unk> everybody looked really silly at dances
dancing to music they couldn't hear <unk>
they just couldn't lead a normal life <unk>
sil
then they decided to lower him down a well and let him play
where down where no one could hear him john thought that was an okay idea
but there was an echo in the well that made the flute sound louder
sil
windows were breaking
sil
and all the
sil
cows in town started to make sour milk
sil
the local scientist
doctor wong came up with an idea
he thought that
sil
he thought if he made a new <unk> mouthpiece especially shaped for john's mouth perhaps he could play the flute normally
and guess what
it worked doctor wong was the town hero
the flute sounded normal and it turned out john could play it quite well
the people in the town decided to have a great parade in franksville and celebrate the fact that there was no water problem
no fly problem
and no flute problem
doctor wong and john were the s stars of the parade so they
were on the main float
sil
a a big band played as they marched up and down the street
everyone cheered
sil
suddenly a fly landed on a little girl
then another
then w <unk>
then other one landed <unk>
sil
then other one landed on
on a big girl
sil
then one landed on everything
then two landed on everyone
pretty soon tons of flies
sil
were landing on everyone
before they knew it the town was filled with flies again
oh no said police chief sanders just when things were going good for franksville
sil
john didn't know what
to do so he just kept on playing his flute
the flies were annoying
so he would swat at at them with his hand or even his new flute
he started shaking the flute to get the flies off and accidentally smashed it into pieces
sil
he was very upset at first <unk>
then he said
oh well good thing i brought my old flute as a back up
sil
no no don't play your old flute
begged to doctor wong
it was too late
john had started playing
when the townsfolk <unk> heard the noise they couldn't even swat at the f
sil
flies anymore
they had to cover their ears from the horrible sound
the flies would land all over the people and they couldn't swat them off it was gross
then suddenly
sil
the flies flew away as fast as they could
sil
doctor wong <unk> thought for a second then pronounced
it's the flute sound
the flies hate
joh <unk>
john's flute playing as much as we do
jo <unk> john the dentist is driving the flies away
sil
it was
then when the people of franksville realized that they
would have to take the good with the bad
sil
because <unk> as bad as the flute sounded
it was a lot better than <unk> thousands of flies crawling on them
from then on
john would wake up at sunrise like a rooster and play to keep the flies away
so that story was about a guy named rooster john he got his name from <unk> from his flute playing because he did it every morning
at first the people didn't like his flute playing since it sounded awful because of the odd shape of his mouth
but they finally decided to like it because it kept the flies away and that was a lot better then having lots of flies crawling on them
sil
i'm going to tell you about rooster john but i'll have to start first with the town of franksville
in franksville they just didn't seem to stop having problems the first problem was water
they ran out of water luckily someone found dug a hole in the ground and found water
then flies came millions of flies
sil
then but then when
sil
let's see john came he
sil
played his flute which sounded awful that was another problem but then the flies went away
sil
the people everyone tried to make john stop flutes stop playing the flute
police chief sanders even threw him in jail but he had to let him go since he wasn't since john wasn't actually breaking a law
sil
but then a scientist named doctor wong
discovered uh how to make a mouth mouth piece for john that would make his flute sound normal
so he played the flute rather well
but the flies came back
sil
then his n he smashed his new flute on the wall trying to swat a fly so he got his old one out and played it but it didn't have the special mouthpiece so
sil
so it sounded awful everyone had to cover their ears
and they thought that flies would crawl all over them except that the flies were flying away because they didn't like the sound of the flute either
it was deep dazzling lovely blue deeper than the deepest blue of the sky
what if he had brains and military skin skills skill and all the sort of all that sort of thing
sil
yes said anne kindly i've heard that you and he were engaged once
he had gent he had gently and refined features and his voice was soft and pleasant in tone
one would suppose that they knew nothing at all about school affairs but they do
sil
it never occurred to him that she might be char changed himself
sil
good friend said the other gently i have business otherwise elsewhere sorry
sil
thereupon i told the king without any reserve all that had happened
sil
hands hans went up and down the street of amsterdam that that day looking for work
the shelf was cow the shelf the slave the no the shelves were coward with dusty
sil
utensils <unk> utensils of all sorts
worst does <unk> i ever endure worst dose <unk> i worst dose <unk> ever endured and i'd i'd nothing to do but swelter in the heat
<br> he h has broken no word of the the law of jungle the law of the jungle
that's a good dog anyone can tell that
the king thought and thought forward frowned hard and rubbed his ear
what are those foolish bundles in the back of the silly cart
but i'm awfully hungry i wished i wish you'd get me something to eat
sil
men men rejoiced openly hopping hoping that it would spread and send them into camp
sil
marco only stood quite still and looked at him with understanding grave grave gravity
sil
i think i see pearls and diamonds come out of the girl's mouth
sil
the airplane ride
the first time i ever took a
sil
and ride by myself in
sil
it was very scary i didn't know anyone
at all and i had to
go all the way
from new york to texas
without my parents
<unk> i was going there
sil
to see my grandfather
we were going to
sil
go fishing
sil
i've
sil
always thought
sil
flying was fun
sil
you go higher than
any mountain and you
go faster than a car any car
sil
but to tell the truth
without my parents there
i was pretty nervous
i guess it was because the plane was so loud and i didn't
sil
know how anyone
sil
i started thinking
sil
we might crash i didn't
like to
sil
think about that but i di couldn't
sil
help it that's
when i missed my
sil
parents the most
once the plane
was in the air i was
pretty good
sil
but
sil
<unk> my moth
my mom gave me
sil
a coloring book of
cool looking dragons to keep me busy
i colored the dragon pictures all green
so it didn't take very long
sil
i only used
sil
the green crayon because
the tallest and
sil
cause it was the tallest
and i wanted
sil
it to catch up to the red blue
sil
yellow purple and black ones
sil
one thing
sil
about being by yourself on an airplane
is that
the flying
flight attendants
sil
are very nice to you
i had seven cola's and four ginger ale's which made me
sil
have to go to the bathroom eight times
i was glad that
sil
there wasn't
sil
anyone next to me the person next to
me would have been very annoyed
sil
even
sil
the flight attendant seemed
a little annoyed that i had
to go to the bathroom so much but it was
sil
her fault
so from
<unk>
from some
sil
re for some reason
she kept trying to give me
peanuts
but i
sil
told her that i
sil
would like a banana split
instead
sil
she s said
they don't have any banana splits on the plane
but sometimes people let
sil
like to eat peanuts on their banana splits
sil
i told her <unk>
that it was
sil
the peanuts that
sil
were making
me so thirsty
in the first place
and that
if <unk> she couldn't get me banana split i wouldn't have
to go the bathroom so much
sil
s
she told me to
sil
be quiet
sil
and watch a movie
sil
i tried to watch the movie but i <unk>
had already seen
th that one
so
it was boring
the flight attendant gave me a deck of cards
sil
an but she wouldn't play
go fish with me
sil
<unk> she said that she had
sil
to help other passengers
sil
i had a game boy in my backpack my backpack was
in the overhead head thingy
i <unk>
tried to push the button
sil
the button that let
sil
lights
sil
up so the flight attendant
sil
wouldn't
would come but
guess what
i was so short sh
to i was to short to reach the button
so i started to yell
hey peanut lady hey peanut lady
sil
she didn't like being called peanut lady but
she did
sil
get my game boy
she told me to call her jennifer instead
i played on my game boy until i
i got my new high score
sil
then jennifer came up to me and said
sil
said she had a s surprise i thought
sil
great more peanuts
but it was
it wasn't peanuts it was something really cool
she <unk>
said the captain was inviting me to
the cockpit i thought awesome
sil
i also
sil
<unk> brought my deck of cards
in case the pilot was bored
sil
and wanted to play go fish
jennifer took me into the cockpit
sil
and that w where
that there were like
sil
a million buttons and levers
sil
and knobs and stuff
and i thought wow look at all those buttons then i thought
there's no way that anyone
can remember to push all those buttons at the right time
sil
we are going to crash
sil
and <unk> the
way i figured it was
sil
my game boy
ha
only ha
sil
had five buttons
and i can
and i can't
sil
get past level three
imagine how <unk>
how
sil
hard it would be to work all those million
millions of buttons
and eat peanuts
sil
and go to the ba to the bathroom
the pilot told me
that it wasn't r
sil
wasn't really that hard once you practiced
sil
then he told me
me that
sil
he once played the game i had on my game boy and
couldn't even pass level one
sil
i said if you can't get past level one
sil
one
sil
and you can be a pilot then
i could
sil
be a pilot too
since i
i'm much better at pushing buttons than you sil are
he laughed <unk> every even though i was joking
sil
he said
he thought i was
would make a great pilot someday if i wanted to be
sil
he was really nice but he wouldn't play go fish with me
sil
finally we landed that's
sil
that's <unk> always scary because
it seems like everything
<unk> e even though we are on the ground
sil
that the plane is going
too fast
to
sil
ever stop
sil
<br> but it did
sil
when <unk> i got off the airplane there was grandpa waiting for me
he said how was your flight and i said someday
i'm going to be a pilot and i
sil
i'll
sil
only serve banana splits on my plane
sil
grandpa laughed and then took
me straight to the ice cream shop
sil
it was worth the whole trip
just to eat a banana split <unk> with grandpa
ok airplane ride was about a kid who went on an airplane alone without his parents to go see his grandpa
<br> and he was nervous and he it was his first time alone so he did
sil
he did some i mean
sil
he did l lots of things on the plane to keep him entertained and he even went to go see the pilot
he played cards he talked to the steward stewardess ah i can't say it uhm he uhm
sil
he talked to the pilot in the cockpit he played his gameboy and he colored dragons in with a green colored crayon
after the usual ceremonies the prince presented his pro proposal
sil
throughout these conversations sam hodge seldom spoke
now he has gone off again for the game is getting scarce
yes my lord sa said the man his sunburned face reddening
for se several days this strangely assorted pair roamed the jungle together
the earl looked at it and the corners of his mouth twitched a little
if god spares beth i never will complain again whispered meg meg earnestly
these thoughts had haunted him all day and he dreamt them all night
for you and me there is nothing to hope for nothing beyond what we have
sil
for nothing brings joy to the he heart like the coming of spring
she could see nothing except for the the morning glories which covered the side of the porch
we never knew that such strange people existed anywhere in the world
she must begin with the chinese dynasty and end with japan <unk>
in the deep gloom she could not see the anger which darkened his face
diana searched faithfully but no axe was to be found in the whole woodshed
she wants to give that boy an extremely bad opinion of me
i know the county stock law just as well as you do
how strange that a live animal should grow on a stalk like a flower
i guess you'll buy a f a few snakes since they look so funny coiling out
see the wisdom of my choice he said holding up the large leaf of gold
but i am too old to endure your sha shame and my misery as much longer
rather would i face three strong men than one young dam damsel
i would love you wa i would love dearly to hear these people describe their ta travels

grandpa laughed and then
took me straight to the
ice cream shop
it was worth the whole trip just to eat a banana split with grandpa
well uhm
sil
he went on the airplane and uhm he was going to see his grandpa and he uhm
sil
he didn't know what to expect expect because he uhm
wasn't with his parents on the plane and uhm the flight attendant kept giving him peanuts and uhm coke and so he had to go to the bathroom a lot
and uhm that annoyed the flight attendant and then uhm she took him up to see the pilot in the front
and uhm he was scared that they were going to crash because he didn't think the pilot could control all the buttons
sil
and uhm
then they landed and he
saw his grandpa and they went to get a banana spilt together
sil
well he uhm tried to play a game with cards
he play his game boy and uhm he went to the bathroom
the red leaves were blown around in millions by the wind
behind lay the ship a picture <unk> not a picture not without its lighter side
and meanwhile by the fur further river bank came rosalind with mushrooms in her skirt
now go and answer your notes and let me finish this splendid story
more courage than my poor brother who stands there like a coward
she rushed frantically across the apartment seized her hood and ran from the cottage
they carry themselves as if they had been drilled both men and women
i fear that we shall have another smart gale however it won't last long
of course there's nothing very inti entertaining here for you
the day ethel brown was seven years old she had a tea party
the youngster lingered for a moment or two watching myles at his work
these words cried destroyed the hope that of a late had been growing within her
its flavor when cooked is more exquisite far than mutton or oysters or eggs
i'm in i'm in earnest huck just as earnest as ever i was in my life
humor and pathos <unk> make it alive and you have found your style at last
the seagrave knelt by his side took his hand and burst into tears
nan said it wouldn't grow in our garden but i brought some home to try it
his boots creaked too so loudly but still he was not at all afraid
she will be glad to see you but she has been very badly frightened
he turned his back on the boy and conferred aside with lawrence
i desire it so much that i will take no refusal
and the prize cup grew clearer and nearer to her mental vision
sil
the slowest turtle
every four years turtle from all over the land would c would crawl to great pond
it would take some turtles from far away villages t two whole weeks just to get there
when all turtles arrived there
sil
turtles could catch up with friends they had not seen since the last festival
everything about the festival was fun but the main event was the great turtle race
the winner of the great turtle race was so important that the winner didn't have to move for four years until the next festival
sil
the less a turtle moves the bigger they get and the longer they live
so you can see the winning so you can see winning the great race is a great honor
the turtle cup was the trophy that the winner could take home to their village
the turtle cup was in a sludge was in sludge pond for over fifty years that's because no one could ever beat the turtle from there
sil
he was the slowest turtle of all time
imagine he hadn't he hadn't had to move for over fifty years
<br> he was the biggest most respected and one of the trickiest turtles in history
there was there were many legends about him it was rumored he was so slow his heart would only b would only beat once a day
his name was mud and he was the greatest champion in the history of the sh shell dwellers festival he was unbeatable
when mud was in his prime there was a new turtle born in blue pond
this turtle's was named swish
when swish was born everyone thought he was a little slow but as he got a older the turtles began to realize that swish was really really really slow
once his mother called him for dinner he didn't make it home until breakfast the next morning and he was only a foot away
blue pond was located about three days crawl from great pond
mostly nice turtles
sil
live in blue pond
but they all felt a little sad because they hadn't held the turtle cup in over seven hundred years
so with swish they thought maybe just maybe he could bring back the turtle cup
everyone treated swish differently
for example mister peeks the local shell cleaner would say hey there swish do you want a free shell waxing today
he we all want you to look good f when you bring home the cup
sil
mrs snapper would say hi swishy do you want some yummy pie to fill you up and slow you down for the big race a fat turtle is a slow turtle
mrs snapper was never nice to anyone but he was but he was being nice to swish
mister peeks would never do anything for free but he was giving swish a free shell waxing
and the extra attention made swish very uncomfortable
sure they are nice to me now because they think i can win the race but if i lose they'll be disappointed and mad at me
i never promised that i would win the race i can't beat mud anyway i heard once it took him three days just to yawn
so one day he told his parents i don't want to race
all the turtles in blue pond held a meeting to discuss the problem
the mayor doctor softshell said this is ridiculous swish has to race <unk> he's the slowest turtle i've every seen
sil
uhm except for mud of course but without him we don't have a chance
sil
but he doesn't want to be treated special he just wants to be normal and he doesn't want everybody to hate him if he can't beat mud
sil
you have to
sil
remember that even though he's gifted at being slow he's still very young said swish's father
we never thought of that they agreed
then the town promised to treat swish like a normal turtle and after a while swish decided that he would be proud to race for his village
when the time of the festival drew near all the turtles all over the land started their crawl toward great pond
swish had to be carried on his father's back since it would have taken him years to get to great pond by himself
finally after the long journey all the turtles arrived at great pond
this was swish's first ever shell dwellers festival he thought it was the most wonderful thing he ever saw
there were thousands of turtles of many different species all having a great time
look there's your cousin peek a boo from big puddle village said swish's mother you'll get to meet all sorts of new turtles
swish was suddenly very excited he told his mom
you know what i'm going to win this race i know it and all these turtles will know that blue pond rules im not afraid of mud
swish's mom smiled and said
i know that you can win swish but we'll be proud of you even if you don't win it's an honor just to get to race said swish's mom
swish saw a big rock in the middle of the festival and wondered about it
how come they don't move that big rock out of the middle of the field it seems to be in everyone's way said swish
that's not a rock sweetie said his mom <unk> that's mud
swish made a loud gulp sound
swishes father said son don't worry about it you know my grandfather raced mud once
he wasn't as slow as you but he did teach me a thing or two
<unk> then he told swish all of mud's dirty tricks so that swish would be ready for them
after seven days of playing and dancing and bug eating finally the day of the race came
the mayor of great pond mrs tort passed the rules of the race for everyone to see
the rules were nailed to the tree for all to see
they read rule number one the great race begins at sunrise and ends at sunset
rule number two all turtles must run as fast as they can and the turtle that is closest to the starting line wins
sil
rule number three no turtle may pretend to be going as fast as they can but go slow instead
all turtle must go as fast as they can at all times since turtles never cheat this is the most important rule
to break this rule would mean an end to the great turtle race forever
rule number four no turtle may fall asleep since if you are asleep you aren't running as fast as you can
swish already
sil
swish read the rules even though he knew them by heart
then he heard the mayor say runners please take your positions
the slowest turtles from each pond were carried to the starting line by members of their villages
there were about three hundred turtles racing
the turtles stretched and thought really slow thoughts as they as they did the sky turned from black to dark blue
they looked at the horizon and saw the sun was starting the rise
just then the mayor said ready set slow and off they went
<unk> all the turtles were very very slow
so it took some time before anyone could figure out which turtles were the slowest
but after a few hours most of the turtles had gone a few feet all except two
sil
swish and mud were both back at the starting line it looked as if neither of them had moved at all
they were both moving of course but they were so slow it was hard to tell
after six hours mud and swish were still tied and had only moved a few inches
by now all the turtles were way ahead of mud but this time swish was just as slow
mud knew that this would be his closest raced ever and he was actually getting a little bit scared of this swish kid
who is this young punk he thought to himself
sil
mud said to swish there's no way that a turtle as young as you can be so slow
<br> even i was faster than you when i was your age you're cheating you're going to ruin the great race forever
but swish wouldn't let mud scare him
you're just trying to make me quit i'm not going to fall for your tricks he said he said turtles never cheat and i'm a turtle with honor
then mud tried another trick he started singing in a soft beautiful lullaby swish started yawning
he was tired from racing and thought that it would be nice to just listen to mud's sweet voice and fall asleep
then he snapped out of it and remembered his father told him about this trick gave him earplugs
sil
he put the earplugs in his ears and couldn't hear mud's singing anymore
mud kept singing his lullaby for a few hours but he stopped right before sunset
the crowd thought he must have realized that it wasn't working
but then right at the end right before the sunset
sil
swish started to pull ahead of mud
oh no shouted the fans mud's winning it looks like mud is still the greatest turtle of them all
and then when the sun went down mud was the closest turtle to the starting line
swish was sad that he lost but all the turtles from blue pond
sil
cheered for swish
sil
they were very proud he gave mud such a close race
swish was just happy too was just happy too but deep down inside he knew he was just as slow as mud
the mayor of pondland went to present turtle cup to sludge pond again
<unk> she announced well mud it looks like you've done it sludge pond wins the turtle cup again
this time it was a bit closer than you would have liked i'll bet
what what would you like to say to all the turtles at the festival
the crowd started yelling speech speech
mud didn't answer
the mayor tapped mud on the shell and said hello hello mud
mud still didn't answer in fact mud was sound asleep
mud had actually sung himself to sleep
ladies and gentlemen said mrs trout tort
mud from sludge pond has been disqualified for sleeping during the race
this means that we have a new champion the real winner is swish softbelly at blue pond the crowd went wild
sil
ms tort went up to swish and gave him the turtle cup
she said swish you are the youngest winner of the great turtle race that was the most exciting finish we've ever had
i think that you will be a great champion for many years since only turtles only get slower with age
for the first time in six hundred years i would like to present the turtle cup to blue pond the crowd went wild again
swish took the cup that day for the first time
he would take it many more times after that it was because of swish that blue pond became the most respected pond in the land
he would never lose the turtle cup for the rest of his long life
but though he became the greatest and biggest turtle of all time
much greater or bigger than mud he always made sure that no one treated him special and that he treated everybody like he wanted to be treated
like a turtle with honor
another turtle showed him that cheating's not the most important thing and winning isn't the most important thing and it's good to be treated like everybody else
cause even though you're a winner you're still like everybody else
sil
and
sil
so there's this turtle named mud who wins every turtle championship for the last seven hundred years
and so then finally this other pond gets this new <br> slow turtle and they think he can win so when the next turtles race comes he races in it and he
swish is the turtle's name swish and mud race against each other and uhm they're tied for practically the whole time until the very end but during
the <br> the story during the race mud is trying to get
sil
uhm swish to fall asleep by singing him to sleep and then actually he f sings himself to sleep and you're not allowed to fall asleep during a race so
then swish wins a championship actually instead of mud and nobody's beaten mud for six seven hundred years
and
sil
so y yeah that's it ba
the earl's the earl's next speech dashed that hope into a thousand fragments
this little john did though this little john did though without disturbing his master of rising rising rising from where he sat

now all the people rejoiced because the because the wicked <unk> king should rule them no longer
sil
gracious ain't that an awful lot of money exclaimed david david crockett davy crockett
sil
<br> the airplane ride
the first time i ever took an airplane by myself it was fun and scary
i didn't know anyone at all all and had to go all the way from new york to texas without my parents
i was flying there to see my grandfather and and we were going to the go we were going to go fishing
i always thought flying was fun
you go higher and then any mountain higher than any mountain and you go faster than any car
but to tell your the but to tell you the truth without my parents there i was pretty nervous
i guess it was because the plane was s so loud and i didn't know anyone
i started thinking he might crash i didn't like to think about that but i couldn't help it
that's when i missed my parents the most
sil
but once the plane was in the car in the air i was pretty good
<unk> my mom gave me a coloring book and a cool looking dragons to keep me busy
a col i colored the dragon pictures all green so it didn't take very long
i only used to only used the green crayon because it was the tallest and i wanted it to catch up to the red brown blue yellow purple and black ones
sil
one thing about being by yourself on an airplane is that the flight attendants are very nice to you
i had seven coca col colas and four ginger ginger ales
which made me have to go to the bathroom eight times i was glad that there wasn't anyone next to me
the person next to me would be would have been very annoyed
sil
uhm
sil
in even
sil
eventually the flight flight attendant seemed to get a little annoyed that i had to go to the bathroom so much
but it was her fault
she was the one who kept trying to give me peanuts
sil
i told her that i wanted a banana split instead but she said they
sil
they don't have any banana splits on the plane
but sometimes people like to eat peanuts on their banana splits
i told her that it was the peanuts that were making me so thirsty in the first place in the first place and that
sil
and that if she would get me a banana split i wouldn't i wouldn't have to go the bathroom so much
she told me to be quiet and watch the movie
i tried to watch the movie but i had already seen that one so it was boring
the flight attendant gave me a deck of cards but she wouldn't play go fish with me
<unk> she said that she had to help other passengers
i had a game boy in my backpack
by my backpack was in the overhead thing thingy
i tried to push the button that lights up over my head so the flight attendant would come but guess what i was so short to reach the button
so i started yelling hey peanut lady hey peanut lady
she didn't like being called peanut lady but she didn't give me my game boy
she told me to call her jennifer instead
i played on my game boy until i got my new high score
then jennifer came up to me and said she had a surprise i thought great i thought great more peanuts
but it wasn't peanuts it was something really cool
she said the captain was inviting me to see the cockpit i thought awesome
i also brought my deck of cards in case the pilot was bored and wanted to play go fish
jennifer took me into the cockpit and there were a million buttons and levers and knobs and stuff
at first i thought wow look at all those buttons
then i thought there's no way that anyone can remember to push all those buttons at the right time
<br> we are going to crash
sil
the way i figured it my game boy my game boy only was five buttons and i
sil
can't get past level three
imagine how hard it would be to work all those millions of buttons and eat peanuts
the pilot told me that it wasn't really that hard once you practiced
<br> then he told me that he once played the game i had on my game boy and he couldn't even pass level one
i said if you can't even get past level one and you're a pilot
then i could be a pilot too s pilot too since i'm much better at pushing buttons that you are pushing buttons than you are
he laughed even though i was joking he said he thought i would make a great pilot someday if i wanted to be if i wanted to be
he was ready really nice but he wouldn't play go fish with me
finally he landed
sil
that's always scary
it seemed like the plane in the plane is going
sil
too fast
sil
to ever stop but it doesn't but it does
when i got off the airplane there were was grandpa waiting for me he said how was your flight
i said someday i'm going to be a pilot and i'll only serve banana splits on my plane
grandpa laughed and told and took me straight to the ice cream shop
it was worth the whole trip just to eat a banana split with grandpa
there was a boy who went on an air flight airplane and the
sil
and he went to the bathroom like eight times
and uhm <br> and the flight attendant gave him tons of peanuts that made him thirsty
and uhm <br>
sil
he wanted a banana split
sil
but he they didn't have banana splits so he wanted to play his game boy so
he called out peanut lady peanut lady she came back and didn't like being called peanut lady and told him to call him jennifer
and <br> then
sil
<br>
sil
uhm then h he she got the game boy down and he
sil
uhm got the high score <br> and then she said that he could go the pilot's invited him to come see the cockpit
and he got to see all the buttons and he thought that they were going to crash
so then <br> they landed and he always thought that it was hard to land since it was so since the plane was going so fast and then his grandpa was there and they took him to the ice cream shop <br>
uhm it was a deep dazzling lovely blue deeper than the deepest blue of the sky
he had gentle and refined features and his voice was soft and pleasant in tone
one would suppose that they knew nothing at all about school affairs but they do
at practically the same instant the third shot whistled from the east
a shadow that chilled his heart seemed gradually to fall upon him
it never occurred to him that he might be changed changed herself
good friends good friend said the other gently i have business elsewhere
thereupon i told the king without any re reserve all that had happened
hans went up and down the streets of amsterdam that day looking for work
sil
yes said ben immensely relieved to find that no offense had been taken
worst dose <unk> i ever endured and i'd nothing to do but swelter in that heat
the shelves were crowded with dusty utensils of all sorts
she gathered up the moss and the remains of the bees wax
he has broken no word of the law of the jungle
that's a good dog anyone can tell that
the king thought and thought frowned hard and rubbed his ear
what are those foolish bundles in the back of this silly cart
but i'm awfully hungry i wish you'd get me something to eat
men rejoiced openly hoping that it would spread and send them into camp
great was the indignation of that noble bird as he watched the scene below
i think i see pearls and diamonds come out of the girl's mouth
what if i what if he had brains and military skill and all that sort of thing
sil
yes said anne can candidly i've heard that you and he were engaged once
sil
the slowest turtle
every four years turtle from all over the land would crawl to great to great pond
it would t it would take some turtles from far away villages two whole weeks just to get there
when all the turtles arrived there was a seven day festival called the shell dwellers festival where there was lots of eating and laughing
turtles could catch up with friends they had not seen since the last festival
everything about the festival was fun but the main event was the great turtle race
the winner of the great turtles race was so important that he or she didn't have to move for four years until the next festival
the less a turtle moves the bigger they get and the longer they live so you can see
sil
you can see winning the great race is a great honor
the turtle cup was a trophy that the winner would take home to their village
the turtle cup was in sludge pond for over fifty years that's because no one could ever beat the turtle from there

mrs snapper was never nice to anyone but she was being nice to swish
mister peeks would never do anything for free but he was going to give swish a free shell waxing
<unk> all the all the extra attention made swish very uncomfortable
surely they are nice to me now because they think i can win the race but if i lose they'll be disappointed and mad at me
uh i never promised that i would win the race i can't beat mud anyway
i heard once it took him three days just to yawn
so one day he told his parents i don't want to race
all the turtles in big blue pond in blue pond held a meeting to discuss the problem

to remember that even though he's gifted he's still very young said swish's father
we never thought of that they agreed then the town agreed to treat swish like a normal turtle

finally after the long journey all the turtles arrived at th at great pond
this was swish's first ever shell dwellers festival
he thought it was the most wonderful thing he had ever saw
there were thousands of turtles many different species all having a great time
sil
look there's your cousin peek a boo from big puddle village said swish's mother you'll get to meet all sorts of new turtles
i swish was suddenly very excited
he told his mom you know what i'm going to win this race i know
sil
i know it
and all these turtles will know that blue pond rules i'm not afraid of stupid mud
swish's mom smiled and said i know that you can win swish but we'll be proud of you even if you don't win
it's an honor just to ra to get to race said swish's mom
swish saw a big rock in the middle of the big festival and wondered about it
how can how come they don't move that big rock out of the field it seems to be in everyone's way said swish
that's not a rock sweetie said his mom that's mud
swish made a loud gulp sound

you know my grandfather raced mud once <unk> he wasn't as slow as you but he did teach me a thing or two
then he told swish about all of the mud's dirty tricks so that swish would be ready for them

sil
the mayor of great pond <unk> mrs tort passed the rules of the race to everyone for to see
the rules were nailed to a tree to to a tree for all to see
they read rule number one the great race begins at sunrise and ends at sunset
rule number two all turtles must run as fast as they can and the turtle that is closest to the starting line wins
rule number three no turtle may pretend to be going as fast as they can but go slow instead
all turtle must go as fast as they can at all times
since turtles never cheat this is the most important rule to break this rule would mean an end to the great turtle race forever
rule number four <unk> no turtle may fall asleep since if you are asleep you aren't running as fast as you can
swish read the rules even though he knew them by heart
then he heard the mayor say runner's please take your positions
sil
the slowest turtles from each pond were carried to the starting line by members of their villages
there were about three hundred turtles racing
they were all the slowest of slow
the turtles all stretched and thought really slow thoughts
and as they did n did the sky turned from black to dark blue
they looked at the horizon and saw the sun was starting the rise just then the mayor said ready set slow and off they went
all the turtles were very very slow so it took some time before anyone could figure out which turtles were the slowest
but after a few hours most of the turtles had gone a few feet <unk> except two
swish and mud were both back at the starting line
it looked as if neither of them had moved at all
they were both moving of course oh of course but they were s so slow that it h was hard to tell
after six hours mud and swish were still tied and had only moved a few inches
by now all the turtles were way ahead of mud but this time swish was just as slow
mud knew that this would be his closest race ever and he was actually getting a bit scared of swish kid of this swish kid
who is this young punk
sil
he thought to himself
sil
mud said to swish there's there's no way that a turtle as young as you can be so slow
even i was faster than you when i was your age you're cheating you're going to ruin the great race forever
but swish wouldn't let mud scare him
you're just trying to make me quit i'm not going to fall for your tricks he said
turtles never cheat and i'm a turtle with honor
then mud tried another trick
he started singing a soft beautiful lullaby
swish started yawning
he was tired from racing but racing and thought that it would be ni be nice j to just listen to mud's sweet voice and fall asleep
then he snapped out of it and remembered his father told him about this trick ga trick gave him earplugs
sil
he put the earplugs in
sil
his ears and couldn't hear mud's singing anymore
mud kept singing his lullaby for a few hours but he stopped right before sunset
the crowd thought he must have realized that it wasn't working
but then right at the end right before the sunset swish started to pull ahead of mud
oh no shouted the fans mud mud's winning it looks like mud is still the greatest turtle of them all
and when the sun went down mud was the closest to the starting line
sil
swish was sad
sil
that he had that he lost but all the turtles from blue pond cheered for swish
they were very proud he gave mud such a close race
swish was happy t but but deep down inside he knew he was just as slow as mud
the mayor of pondland went to present the turtle cup to sludge pond again
she announced well mud it looks like you've done you've done it sludge pond wins the turtle cup again
this time it was a bit closer than you would have liked i'll bet
sil
what would you like to say to all the turtles at the festival the crowd started yelling speech speech
mud didn't answer the mayor tapped mud on the shell and said hello hello mud
mud still didn't answer in fact mud was sound asleep mud had actually sung himself to sleep
sil
ladies and gentlemen said ms tort
mud from sludge pond has been disqualified for sleeping during the race
this means that we have a new champion the real winner is swish softbelly of blue pond the crowd went wild
sil
ms tort went up to swish and gave him the turtle cup
she said swish you are the youngest winner of the great turtle race that was the most exciting finish we've ever had
i think that you'll be a great champion for many years since turtles only get slower with age
for the first time in six hundred years i would like to present the turtle cup to blue pond the crowd went wild again
swish took the cup that day for the first time
he would take it many more times after that
sil
it was because of swish that blue pond became the most respected pond in the land
he would never lose the turtle cup for the rest of his long life
but though he became the greatest and biggest turtle of all time much greater or bigger than mud
he always made sure that no one treated him special and that he treated everybody like he wanted to be treated like a turtle with honor
so there's a turtle who is really young and he's a really slow turtle
and there's this one really big slow turtle who's the slowest turtle
and so there's this race uhm for all the different ponds
and they try to find the slowest turtle from the pond and they all race and they see which is the slowest turtle
and the slowest turtle their pond is honored with a cup and so swish is really young and he uhm races against mud the slowest turtle for a long long time
and people start treating swish with uhm like a lot of respect and they keep on treating him specially
and so uhm he askes them not to treat him specially because he won't want to race then
and so then they stop treating him specially and he races the race and he doesn't win but
when the l lady who makes the race uhm when she's giving mud the uhm cup uhm
sil
he falls asleep and so the miss tort who runs the race uhm she says mud has been disqualified for sleeping the real champion is swish and swish wins and in the end he makes and he wins and his pond is really respected
and he makes sure that nobody treats him specially and that everybody's treated how he he is treated
after the usual ceremonies the prince presented his proposal
now he has gone off again for this game is getting scarce <unk> scarce s scarce
yes my lord s said the man he s his sunburned face reddening
even if there has been some little mistake what could i do now to fix it
for several day days this strangely assorted pair roamed the jungle together
the earl looked at it and the corners of his mouth twitched a little
if god spares beth i'll i never will complain again whispered meg earnestly
for you and me there is nothing to hope for nothing beyond what we have
she could see nothing except the morning glories which covered the side of the porch
we never knew that such strange people existed anywhere in the world
she must begin with the chinese dynasty <unk> and end with japan
in the deep gloom she could hear er she could not see the anger which darkened his face
diana searched faithfully but no axe was to be found in the whole woodshed
she wants to give that boy an extremely bad opinion of me
i know the country stock law just as well as you do
how strange that a live live animal should grow on a stalk like a flower
i guess i'll buy a few snacks since they look so funny coiling out
see the wisdom of my choice he said holding up the large leaf of gold
but i am too old to endure your shame and my misery much longer
rather would i face three strong men than one young damsel
i would love dearly to hear these people describe their travels
sil
rooster john
before i tell you how rooster john got its name got his name you should know a little bit about the town of franksville
franksville was a town that seemed to have one p one problem after the other
their problems started when they ran out of water
thankfully someone was digging a hole and found water
but soon after they got after that they started to get f flies
they got tons and tons of flies they then the flies stopped
but just then a man moved into town who played the flute so badly that people would run away screaming
maybe a poorly played flute doesn't sound all that bad
but just try to imagine someone scratching a chalkboard with a f fork and then multiply that times a hundred
that's how the flute sounded when h when this guy played it
i'm serious what still it's still uh still it's not as bad as millions of flies i suppose
the bad flute player was rooster john
he wasn't called rooster john yet that came later
he was the new town dentist he was an excellent dentist but his real love was music
he played many musics musical instruments such as the guitar the tuba the piano and the clarinet
however for the same r reason the way his mouth was shaped made his flute sound awful
sil
we can't let you play the flute anymore john said police chief s sanders
the neighbors are complaining and the cats and dogs are trying to chew off their ears
but i have to play i was born to do it
i don't know why but i feel like i have to do i have to or else bad things will happen
look john i've heard you play the clarinet you're quite good why don't you play that instead said the chief sanders
oh that's a nice instrument but that's just not the flute
i i even wrote you a song chief sanders it's called cops and robbers
<unk> then he played the song the police chief hated the sound so much that he threw john in jail
but they couldn't keep john in jail since he wasn't really breaking any laws so there w there was nothing that nothing the police could do
besides everybody loved john since he had become the town dentist
everybody's teeth were so much teeth were much whiter and cleaner and no one had any cavities
so there was a problem in the little town of franksville
sil
what should they do they couldn't keep john in jail and they didn't want to ki kick him out of town because they all h had such nice teeth
so they decided that john could play the flute and everybody else would have to wear earplugs
well i'm sure you guessed that didn't work
no one could hear anything
people were getting into car accidents and everybody looked really silly at dances dancing to music they couldn't hear
they just couldn't lead the lead a normal life <unk>
th <unk> then they decided to lower him down a well and let him play down where no one could hear him
john thought that that wasn't an
sil
ok idea
but there was an an echo in the well that made the flute sound louder
window were breaking and all cows in town started to make sour milk
he thought that if he made a new mouthpiece that especially shaped for john's mouth that then perhaps he could play the flute normally
and guess what it worked
doctor wong was the town hero
the flute sounded normal and it turned out john could play it quite well
<br> the people in the town decided to have a great big parade in franksville
to celebrate the fact that for once there was no water problem no fly problem and no flute problem
doctor wong and john were s the stars of the parade
they were up t they were up on the main float
a big band played as they marched up and down main street everyone cheered
sil
<unk> then suddenly a fly landed on a little girl
then the fly landed on someone else then the then some landed on a bunch of people
then pretty soon tons of flies were landing on everyone before they knew it the towns town was filled with flies again
oh no said said chief sanders just when things were go going good in franksville
john didn't know what to do so he just kept on playing his flute
the flies were annoying so he would s swat at them with his hand or even his new flute
sil
he started shaking the flute s to get the flies off and accidentally smashed it into pieces
he was very upset at first then he said oh well good thing i brought my old flute back as back up
no no please don't p don't play your old flute begged doctor wong
but it was too late john had started playing
when the townsfolk heard the noise they couldn't even swat at the flies anymore
they had to cover their ears from horrible sound
the flies would land all over the people and they couldn't swat swat them off
it was gross then suddenly the flies flew away fast as they could
doctor wong thought for a second then p pronounced
it's the flute sound the
sil
the flies hate john's flute playing as much as we do
john the dentist is driving the f flies away
it was then that the people of franksville realized that they would have to take the good with the bad
because as bad the flute sounded it was a lot better than thousand thousands of flies crawling on them
from now on john would wake up at sunrise like a rooster and p and play to keep the flies away
ok uhm k john w john came to this town franskville and uhm he was a dentist and he played flute but he played flute really really bad
and when john came here and played the flute he uhm i mean the flies just went away and since everybody didn't like that sound uhm doctor wong
sil
doctor wong made a flute just for him
and he could play flute normally
and but but then flies came back
and then uhm and then he
he he wait like he attacked the flies with the flute and he broke it so he
sil
so he uhm got the old one and played the flute and everybody hated the hated that sound and flies hated it too
so the flies went away again and
sil
and see
sil
and every morning
<br>
every morning john
sil
played the flute to keep the flies away so uhm he became the rooster john
and still she sat and still she reeled and still she wished for company
sil
now then that if you tell the reason i shall instantly die
aye i know said the dame gently fearing to interrupt the story
you certainly are an able minded youngster hiram he observed
after dinner jordan crept up by way of the back stairs to see her
then the journey oh onwards till they almost reached the mountains <unk>
the sword cannot stand against an oaken staff such as mine
for you never knew exactly what this man might do or say
don't make any of your abrupt remarks or do anything odd will you
nan received a sewing machine to remind her of the fresh air work
he tilted his hat brim to shade his face and looked for his chicken
diana shook her head gleefully her black eyes dancing with merriment
sil
then she pulled the hood of his cloak over his ears and over his brow
which of you boys placed this stone signal asked the young explorer
they shook the flour off her and set her down on the kitchen floor
i beg your pardon said the learned man is this it it is an old habit with me
she saw that on the grass was in w the broken wheel beside her
sil
the slowest turtle
every four years turtles from all over the land would crawl to great pond
it would take some turtles far away from the villages two whole weeks just to get there
when all the turtles arrived there was a seven day festival called the shell dwellers festival
there were lots of eating and laughing
turtles could catch up with friends they had not seen since last since the last festival
<unk> everything about the festival was fun but the main event was the great turtle race
<unk> every winner of the great turtle race was so important that he or she didn't have to move for years
sil
but until the next festival
the lesson
sil
the less a turtle moves the bigger they got and the longer they live so you can see winning the great race is a great honor
<unk> the turtle cup was a trophy
sil
<br> that the winner would take home to their village
that's because no one could ever beat the turtle
sil
from there
he was the slowest turtle of all time imagine he hadn't
sil
had to move for fifty years
<unk> he was the biggest most respected
sil
and no one of the trickiest turtles in history
there were many l legends about him
sil
it was a it was rumored
sil
he was so slow his heart would only beat once a day his name was mud
when mud
sil
was in his prime
sil
there was a new turtle born in blue pond
this turtle was named swish
when swish was born everyone thought he was a little slow but he got but
sil
the turtles but he got a little older the turtles began to realize
sil
that swish was really really really slow
once his mother called him for dinner and he didn't
sil
make it home until breakfast the next day morning
sil
and he was only one foot away
blue pond was a located about three days crawl from the great pond
mostly nice turtles lived in blue pond
but they all felt a little sad because they hadn't held the turtle cup in over seven hundred years
so with swish they thought maybe <unk> just maybe he could bring the back the turtle cup
everyone treated swish differently for example mister peeks the local shell cleaner would say hey
sil
there swish do you want a free shell waxing today
we all want you to look good
sil
when you bring home the cup
sil
ms snapper would say hi swishy do you want some yummy pie to fill you up and slow you down for the big race a fat turtle is a slow turtle
ms snapper was never nice to anyone but she was being nice to swish
sil
mister peeks would never do anything for free
sil
but she was
sil
he was giving swish a free shell waxing
extra attention made swish very uncomfortable
they sure sure they are nice to me now because i think i can win the race
but if i lose they'll be disappointed and mad at me
i never promised
sil
that i would win the race
i can't beat mud anyway i heard once it took him three days just to yawn
<unk> so one day he told his parents i don't want to race
all the turtles in blue pond held a meeting to discuss this problem
the mayor o doctor softshell said this is ridiculous
swish swish has to race he's the slowest turtle i've every seen except for mud of course
but without him we don't have a chance
sil
but he doesn't want to be treated special he just wants to be normal and he doesn't want everybody to hate him if he can't beat mud
you have to remember that even though he's gifted he's still very young
sil
and s said swish's swish's father <unk>
we'll we never thought that they agreed thought of that they agreed
then the town promised to sweet to treat swish like a normal turtle after a while they decided that he would be proud for
sil
to race for his village
sil
when the time of the festival drew near all the turtles
sil
all over the land started to crawl there
sil
crawl
sil
started their crawl toward
sil
great pond
swish had to be carried on his father's back since it would have taken him
sil
years to get to great pond by himself
sil
finally after the long journey all the turtles have arrived at great pond
this was swish's first ever shell shell uh shell dwellers festival
he thought it was the most wonderful thing he ever saw
there were thousands of turtles many different species all having a great time
look there's your cousin peek a boo from big puddle village said swish's mother you'll get to meet all sorts of new turtles
swish s was suddenly very excited
he told his mom you know what i'm going to win this race i know it
all these turtles will know that blue pond rules i'm not afraid of mud
swish's mom smiled
sil
i know that you can win swish but we'll be proud of you even if you don't win it's just an honor to get to the race said swish's mom
swish saw a rock in the middle of the big festival and wondered about it
how come they don't move that big rock out of the middle of the field it seems to everyone's way
sil
that's not a rock sweetie said mom that's mud
sil
swish made a loud gulp sound
swishes father said son don't worry about it
you know my grandfathers raced mud once he was as slow as you but he did teach me a thing or two
then he told swish about all the muddy all of mud's dirty tricks so that swish would be ready for them
after seven days of playing and dancing and bug eating finally the day of the race came
sil
mayor of the great pond
sil
ms tort posted the rules of the race for everyone to see
the rules were nailed to a tree for all to see
they read rule number one the great race begins at sunrise and ends at sunset
rule number two all turtles must run as fast as they can and the turtle that is closest to starting the line wins
ruling
sil
okay
sil
all the turtles must run as fast as they can and the turtle that is the closest to the starting line wins
rule number three no turtle may pretend to go be going as fast as they can but go slow instead
all turtles must go as fast as they can at all times
since turtles n never cheat this is the most important rule to break this rule would mean an end to the great turtle race forever
rule number four no turtle may fall asleep since if you are asleep you aren't running as fast as you can
swish read the rules even though he knew them in his heart
sil
the by them
then he heard the mayor say runners please take your positions
<unk> the slowest turtle from each pond were carried to the starting line by members of their village
sil
there
sil
were about three hundred turtles racing
there were all the slowest of slow
the turtles stretched the really slow thoughts
sil
as the sky did turned from black to dark blue they looked at the horizon the sun was starting the rise
just then the mayor
sil
said ready set slow and off they went
the turtles were very very slow
so it took some time before anyone could figure out which of the turtles were the slowest
after a few hours most of the turtles
sil
had gone a few feet except for two
swish and mud were both in the back at the starting line
it looked as if neither of them had moved at all
they were both moving of course but they were so slow it was hard to tell
after six hours mud and swish were still tied and had only moved a few inches
by now all the turtles were way ahead of mud but this time swish was just as slow
mud knew that this would be the closest race he had ever
sil
ever and he would actually getting a little bit scared of this swish kid
who is this young punk he thought to himself
mud said to swish there's no way that
sil
a turtle as young as you can be so slow even when
sil
i was faster than you were young i was your age
you're cheating you're going to ruin the great race forever
but swish wouldn't let mud scare him
you're just trying to make me quit i'm not going to fall for your tricks
he said turtles never cheat i'm a turtle with honor
then mud tried another trick he started singing a soft beautiful lullaby
swish started yawning
but he was so tired from racing he thought that it be nice to just listen to mud's sweet voice and fall
but then he snapped out of it and remembered his father telling him about this trick and he
sil
and gave him earplugs
but he he put the earplugs in his ears and couldn't hear mud's singing anymore
but mud kept singing his lullaby for a few hours but he stopped right before sunset
the crowd thought he must have realized that it wasn't working
but then right at the end right before the sunset swish started to pull ahead of mud
oh no the sh the sh shouted the fans
mud's winning it looks that like mud is still the greatest turtle of all of them
and the sun went down mud was the closest uhm turtle to the starting line
swish s was sad that he lost the lost but all the turtles from the blue pond cheered for swish
they were very proud he gave mud such a close race swish was happy too
but down deep inside he knew he was just as slow as mud
the mayor of pondland went to present turtle cup to sludge pond again
he announced
sil
well
sil
well mud it looks like you've done it again sludge pond wins the turtle cup again
this time it was a bit closer than you would have liked it i bet i'll bet
but what you like to say to all the turtles at the festival
the crowd started yelling speech speech
mud didn't answer
the mayor tapped on
sil
uhm hello hello mud mud still didn't answer in fact mud was sound asleep mud had actually sung himself to sleep
ladies and gentlemen men ms ms tort mud from sludge pond has been disqualified for sleeping during the race
this means that we have a new champion
the real winner is swish softbelly of blue pond the crowd went wild
sil
ms tort
sil
went up to swish and gave him the turtle cup she said swish you are the youngest winner of the great race great turtle race
that was the most exciting finish we've ever had
i think you'll be a great champion for many years since turtles have only gotten slower with the age
for the first time in seven hundred years i would like to present the turtle cup to blue pond
the crowd went wild again
swish took the cup
sil
that day for the first time he would take it many more times after that
it was because of swish that blue pond became the most respected pond in the land
he would never lose
sil
the turtle cup for the rest of his long life
but though he became the greatest the biggest turtle of all time much greater or bigger than mud
he always made sure that no one treated him special that he liked to be treated by everybody and he wanted to be treated like a turtle with honor
well uhm it's kind of about uhm a turtle who uhm was just he was really young and there was another turtle named mud who was really old and he lives in a different pond
cause they both live in ponds and there's this uhm festival with this race great the great turtle race <br> and mud's been the uhm winner for a long time i don't really know how long though
he uhm and nobody can ever beat him and then this little turtle is really really slow cause the person cause the turtle's who's the slowest wins and uhm
who's the start who's the closest to the finish line and uhm uhm mud plays lots of dirty tricks on during the race to try to get himself to win
but uhm this time he uhm his father swish's father tells him about all the dirty tricks he plays
and so swish was ready for him to tell the tricks and he tried one of them but it didn't work then he tried another one which was a lullaby
but uhm swish was starting to fall asleep but then he remembered that his father gave him some earplugs but then he started to pull ahead of uhm mud which wasn't good
but then uhm but again then uhm <br> god uhm <br>
mud kinda of uhm sung himself to sleep so he was disqualified and in seven hundred years this was the first time in seven hundred years that blue pond that was where swish lived had won the cup
the red leaves were blown around in millions by the wind
and meanwhile by the further river bank came rosalind with mushrooms in her skirt
now go and answer your note and let me finish this splendid story
more courage than my poor brother who stands there like a coward
sh she refuse frantically across the apartment seized her hood and ran from the cottage
they carry themselves as if they had been drilled both men and women
<unk> lindy not being overburdened with perception did not see this
i fear that we shall have another smart gale gale <unk> however it won't last long
of course there's nothing very entertaining here for you
the youngest sister lingered for a moment or two watching myles at his work
the day ethel brown was seven years old he had a tea party
these words quite destroyed the hope that of late had been wandering glowing with her
sil
its flavor when cooked is more exquisite far than mutton or oysters or eggs
i'm in earnest huck just as earnest as ever i was in my life
humor and pathos make it alive and you have found your style at last
seagrave knelt by his side took his hand and burst into tears
nan said it would grow in our garden but i th brought some home to try
his boots creaked too so loudly but still he was not at all afraid
she will be glad to see you but she has been very badly frightened
he turned his back on the boy and con conferred <unk> aside with lawrence
i d i desired it so much that i will take no refusal
and the prize cup grew clearer and clearer to her and mental vision
behind the lay the ship a picture not without its lighter side

the slowest turtles from each pond were carried to the starting line by members of their village
sil
there were about three hundred turtles racing

all the turtles were very very slow so it took some

time before anyone could figure out which turtles were the slowest
but after a few hours the most of the turtles had gone a few feet

except all except two
<unk> swish and mud were both back at the starting line it looked as if neither of them had moved at all
they were both moving of course but they were so slow that it was hard to tell
after six hours mud and swish were still tied and

swish was sad that he lost but all the turtles from blue pond cheered for swish
they were very proud and gave mud such a
sil
close race
swish was happy too but he didn't
sil
he deep down inside he knew he was just as slow as mud
<unk> the mayor of great pond went to present the turtle cup to sludge pond again
she announced well mud it looks like you've done it sludge pond wins the turtle cup again
this time it was a bit closer than you would have liked i'll bet
sil
what you think like to say
sil
all the other turtles at
sil
the festival
the crowd started yelling speech speech
mud didn't answer the mayor tapping mud on the shell and said hello hello mud
mud still didn't answer in fact mud was sound asleep mud had actually sung himself to sleep
ladies and gentlemen said ms tort
mud from sludge pond has been disqualified for sleeping during the race
this means that we have a new champion but the real winner is swish softbelly of blue pond the crowd went wild
ms tort went up to swish and gave him <unk> the turtle cup
she said swish you are the youngest winner of the great race
sil
that was the most exciting finish we we've ever had
i think that you'll be a great champion for many years since turtles only get slower with age
for the first time in seven hundred years
sil
i would like to present the turtle cup to blue pond
sil
<unk> the crowd went wild again
<unk> swish took the cup that day
sil
for the first time he would take it many more times after that
it was because of swish that blue pond became the most respected pond in the land
he went he would never lose the turtle cup for the rest of his long life
but though he
sil
became the greatest turtle or and biggest turtle of all time
sil
much greater or bigger than mud
he always made sure that no one treated him special and that he treated everybody like he wanted to be treated like a turtle with honor
ok so once upon a time there was a turtle named mud who lived in swamp pond and every some years uhm they had a great turtle race which who the slowest turtle would win the race
mud was so big and slow that he always won the race ever if you won the race then you wouldn't have to move for four years and that would mean you'd get bigger and slower
but one day a turtle named swish was born in blue pond he uhm was very slow and he decided to enter the race for his pond
uhm everybody was giving him special attention but he didn't want to be specially treated he wanted to have honor
so one day he uhm his father carried him to the race and he and mud were the only two
who were winning the race they were tied
for a long time when mud started to uhm say you're cheating
you're not supposed to you're not going as fast as you can
and but swish knew that he was just up to his tricks but then uhm mud started singing
sil
uh swish heard from his father about this trick <br> he thought it would be nice to fall asleep but he knew he tr should have won the race
uhm soon
sil
mud started to slow down and and he won the race but then they found out that mud fell asleep
and so uhm
sil
swish won the race and for the rest of his life he kept winning
sil
the end
sil
uhm the airplane ride
the first time i ever took an airplane ride by myself it was fun and scary
i didn't know anyone at all and had to go all the way from new york to texas without my parents
i was flying there to see my grandfather and we were going fi to go fishing
i've always thought flying was fun
you go higher than any mountain and go faster than any car
but to tell you the truth without my parents there i was pretty nervous
i started thinking he mi we might crash
i didn't like to think about that but i couldn't help it
that's when i missed my parents the most but once the plane was in the air i was pretty good
my mom gave me a coloring book
sil
of cool looking dragons to keep me busy
i colored the dragon pictures all green so it didn't take me very long
i only used the green crayon because it was the tallest and i wanted it to catch up with the red brown blue yellow purple and black ones
sil
one thing about being
sil
by yourself on an airplane is that the flight attendants are very nice to you
i had seven cola's and four ginger ale's which made me have to go to the bathroom eight times
sil
i was glad that there wasn't anyone next to me the person next to m to me would have been very annoyed
eventually the flight attendant seemed to get a little annoyed that i had to go to the bathroom so much but it was
sil
but it was her fault
she was the one who kept trying to give me pea peanuts
i told her that i wanted a banana split instead but she said they don't have banana splits on the plane
sil
but sometimes people like to eat peanuts on their banana splits so i told her that
sil
it was the peanuts that were making me so thirsty in the first place
and that if
sil
she would get me a banana split i wouldn't have to go the bathroom so much
she told me to be quiet and watch the movie
i tried to watch the movie but i had already seen the one so it was boring
the flight attendant gave me a deck of cards but she wouldn't play go fish with me
she said she had to
sil
uhm she had to help other passengers
i had a game boy in my backpack
my pack my backpack was in
sil
was in the overhead thingy
i tried to push the button that lights up over the h over my head so the flight attendant would come
but guess what i was too short to reach the button so i started yelling hey peanut lady hey peanut lady
sil
she liked being called peanut lady
sh
oh she didn't like being called peanut lady
sil
but she did get me
sil
my game boy
sil
she told me to call her jennifer instead
i played on my game boy until i got my new high score
then jennifer came up to me and said she had a surprise i thought great more peanuts
but it wasn't peanuts it was something really cool
she said the captain was inviting me to s see the cockpit
i thought awesome
sil
i also brought my deck of cards in case the pilot was bored and wanted to play go fish
sil
jennifer took
sil
me into the cockpit and there was there were a million buttons and levers and knobs and stuff
sil
at first i thought wow look at all these buttons then i thought
sil
there's no way that anyone can remember to push th all these buttons at the right time we are going to crash
sil
the way i figured it my game boy only was five
sil
five buttons and i
sil
can't get past three levels
imagine how hard it would be to work with millions of buttons and get and eat peanuts
the pilots told me that
sil
it wasn't really hard once you practiced
then he told me that
sil
he once played the game i had on my game boy and he couldn't even pass level one
i said if you can't even get past level one and you're a pilot then couldn't
sil
be then i could be a pilot too since i'm much better at pushing buttons than you are
he laughed even though i wasn't joking
sil
he said he thought
sil
i would make a great pilot someday if i wanted to be
he was really nice but he wouldn't play go fish with me
finally we landed
that's always scary it seemed like the plane
sil
is going too fast to ever stop but it does
sil
when i got off the airplane
<unk>
there was grandpa waiting for me he said how was your flight
i said someday i'm going to be a pilot and i'll only serve banana splits on the plane
grandpa laughed and took me straight to the ice cream shop
it was worth the whole trip just to eat a banana split with grandpa
uhm there was a kid and it was his first time riding an airplane
sil
uhm
sil
so at first he was really scared
sil
and his mom gave him a coloring book so to keep him busy and he was on this plane by himself so
sil
he got really scared after awhile and uhm
sil
<unk>
but the good thing he said about being alone uhm
sil
the
sil
like the
sil
car the
sil
uhm
sil
can't remember it's like sort of the waitress on the plane and uhm
sil
she like really took care of him and gave him lots of drinks and peanuts and all sorts of stuff and he had to keep going to the bathroom cause he drank so much
and towards the end uhm the pilot let him see the cockpit
sil
and
sil
he
sil
he said he wanted to be a pilot someday and then after he got off the plane his grandpa took him to get a banana split
it was a deep dazzling lovely blue deeper than the deepest blue of the sky
yes said anne candidly <unk> i've heard that you and he were engaged once
he had gentle and refined features and his voice was soft and pleasant in tone
one would suppose that they knew nothing at all about school affairs but they do
at practically the same instant the third shot whistled from the east
a shadow that chilled his heart seemed gradually to fall upon him
it never occurred to him that she might be changed herself
good friend said the other gently i have business elsewhere
thereupon i told the king without any reserve all that happened
hans went up and looked at the streets of amsterdam that day looking for work
yes said ben immensely relieved to find that no offense had been taken
worst dose i ever endured and i i'd nothing to do but swelter in that heat
the shelves were crowded with dusty utensils of all sorts
she gathered up the moss and the remains of the bees wax
he had broken no word of the law o of the jungle
that's a good dog anyone can tell that
the king thought and thought frowned hard and rubbed his ear
what are those foolish bundles in the back of that silly cart
but i'm awfully hungry i wish you'd get me something to eat
men rejoiced openly hoping that it would spread and send them into camp
marco only stood quite still and looked at him with understanding and gravity
sil
great was the indignation <unk> of the noble bird as he watched the scene below
i think i see pearls and diamonds come out of the girl's mouth
what if he had brains and military school and all that sort of thing
sil
<br>
rooster john
before i tell you how rooster john got his name you should know a little bit about the t town of franksville
franksville was a town that seemed to have one problem after the other
their problems started when they ran out of water
thankfully someone was digging a hole and found water but soon after that they started to get flies
they got tons and tons of flies then the flies stopped
but just then a man moved into town who played the flute so badly that people would run away screaming
maybe a poorly played flute doesn't sound all that bad
but just try to imagine someone scratching on a chalkboard with a fork and then multiply that times a hundred
that's how the flute sounded when this guy played it i'm serious
still it's not as bad as millions of flies i suppose
the bad flute player was rooster john
he wasn't called rooster john yet that came later
he played many musical instruments such as the guitar the tuba the piano and the clarinet
however for some reason the way his mouth was shaped made his flute sound awful
sil
we can't let you play that flute anymore john said police chief sanders
the neighbors are complaining and the cats and dogs are trying to chew off their ears
but
sil
i have to play i was born to do it
i don't know why but i feel like i have to do to or else bad things will happen
look john i've heard you play the clarinet you're quite good why don't you play that instead said chief sanders
oh why that's a nice instrument but it's just not the flute
i even even wrote you a song chief sanders it's called cops and robbers
then he played the song
the police chief hated the sound so much that he threw john in jail
but they couldn't keep john in jail since he wasn't really breaking any laws so there was nothing the police could do
besides everybody loved john since he had become the town dentist everybody's teeth were much whiter and cleaner and no one had any cavities
so there was a problem in the little town of franksville
what should they do they shouldn't keep john in jail and they didn't want to kick him out of town because they all had such nice teeth
so they decided that john could play the flute and everybody else would have to wear earplugs
well i'm sure you guessed that didn't work
no one could hear anything people were getting into car accidents and everybody looked really silly at dances dancing to music they couldn't hear
they just couldn't lead a normal life
then they decided to lower him down into a well and let him play down where no one could hear him
john thought that was an ok idea but there was an echo in the well that made his flute sound louder
windows were breaking and all the cows in town started to make sour milk
the local d scientist doctor wong came up with an idea
he thought that if he made a new mouthpiece especially shaped for john's mouth
then the town decided to have a great big parade in franksville
to celebrate the fact that for once there was no water problem no fly problem and no fruit flute problem
doctor wong and john were all the stars of the parade
they were up in on the main float
a big band band played as they marched up and down main street everyone cheered
then suddenly a fly landed on a little girl
then a fly landed on someone else then some landed on a bunch of people then pretty soon tons of flies were landing on everyone
before they knew it the town was filled with flies again
oh no said chief sanders just when things were going good for franksville
john didn't know what to do so he just kept on playing his flute
the flies were annoying so he would swat at them with his hand or even his new flute
he started shaking the flute to get the flies off and accidentally smashed it into pieces
he was very upset at first then he said oh well good thing i bought brought my old flute as as back up
no no please don't play your old flute begged doctor wong
but it was too late john had started playing
when the townsfolk heard the noise they couldn't even swat at the flies anymore
they had to cover their ears from the horrible sound
the flies would land all over the people and they couldn't swat at them it was gross then suddenly the flies flew away fast as they could
doctor wong thought for a second then pronounced it's the flute sound the flies hate john's flute playing as much as we do
john the dentist is driving the flies away
it was then that the people of franksville realized that they would have to take the good with the bad
because as bad as the flute sounded it was a lot better than thousands of flies crawling on them
<unk> from then on john would wake up at sunrise like a rooster and play to keep the flies away
ok well uhm this story was about rooster john and he played the flute and the clairinet and another instrument
and uhm well the flute sounded really bad when he played it and he didn't want to play the other instruments even though they sounded good
and they didn't want to kick him out of the town because he was a really good dentist and he kept their teeth clean
and uhm he then at the parade they got him a new flute and doctor wong made it the scientist of the town to fit his lips
and so uhm it sounded really good but then all these flies started coming
so so he tried to swat at them with his flute but it broke to pieces
so he started playing his old flute and all the flies left so now uhm they can
sil
he just plays his flute and flies go away
sil
they uhm plugged their ears and they threw him in the well and they threw him in jail
sil
she saw that she was on the grass and the broken wheel beside her
sil
know now then that that if i tell you the reason i shall instantly die
ah i know said the damn the dame gently fearing to interrupt the story
you certainly are an able minded youngster herman hiram <unk> he observed
after dinner jordan crept up by way of the back stairs to see her
then they journeyed onwards till they almost reached the mountains

he titled his hat brim to shade his face and look for his chickens
the poor persecuted <unk> country people believed that the new forest was enchanted
tom's costume was a splendid imitation of a cowboy

it was that day when you got your toe pounded added dave davie looking at joel
sil
nan received a sewing machine to remind her of the fresh air work
we all looked at each other trying to glean something each from the other
diana shook her head gleefully her black eyes dancing with merriment <unk>
then he pulled the hood of his cloak over his ears and over his brow
which of you boys placed this stone single asked the young explorer
they shook the floor off they shook the flour off her and set her down on the kitchen floor
i beg your pardon said the learned man it is an old habit of me
<br>
the panda
it it was fred's idea so let's begin with fred
fred fed the panda bears the tigers and turtles
the turtles were so bad but
sil
weren't so bad but as for the tigers he he wasn't so sure
<br> he didn't mind handling the raw meat he had to feed to the tigers his main object was to be was to being eaten
no one could blame fred really since no one really wants to be eaten
some people do like to bite their finger nails but fred wasn't a nail biter so being eaten was definitely not something he looked forward to each afternoon at three o'clock when it was time to feed the tigers
but the point is that he was very fond of feeding the pandas
<br> there were three pandas and they were known as the pan family
there were they were in order of cuteness yin yin the young daughter poo poo the mother and moo man the gentle and always
sil
sleepy father
many people know know that pandas eat bamboo a lot of it
a lot of bamboo can get quite heavy so because of the pandas fred became very strong and was in terrific shape
the onl the other reason was that anyone who gets within three feet of a panda automatic automatically falls in love with them
it's a law of nature af at future at further distance pandas have a strange almost magical effect on human beings which makes us want to hug and squeeze things
fred was not allowed to actually hug the panda bears since that could be dangerous so all the other people at the zoo would know that the pandas had just been fed when they saw fred hugging the rather un cuddly palm tree outside of the panda's home <unk>
sil
it is interesting to point out at this time that more stuffed panda bears are sold
sil
sold at zoo gift shops then all of the other stuff animals combined
this can almost certainly be accounted for by the strange almost magical effect that the pandas possess
but everything was not all bamboo and hugs at the zoo
one morning fred was feeding yin yin and said oh yin yin i wish that more people would come to visit the zoo
i know i shouldn't be telling you this but we might have to sell you and your family to the big zoo in san angeles
sil
if we don't get more money it's not that you aren't s selling enough stuffed stuffed panda bears
it's just that there haven't been enough people coming to see you in the first place
i think what the zoo needs is a great advertising campaign
fred was standing to starting to feel the uncomfortable urge to hug the panda
so before he ran off to hug the palm tree quickly qui tri tree quickly said its costs so much to feed y you panda bears i would hate it if y if you had to leave us
<unk> after all it's the only home you know besides if you leave i'll get terribly out of shape
now if you excuse me i need to squeeze something before i scream scream
sil
but yin yin the young panda was not listening to fred she was talking to her best friend maggie the magpie about going to the moon
yes the big one in the sky that is most likely not made of cheese and most certainly not made of bamboo
yin yin said h and her best friend maggie the magpie who looked a lot like a panda would look if panda
sil
panda would look if pandas were birds
her mother and h and father knew what they were talking about since they had thought or talked of such else since yin yin said i want to go there and p and pointed to the moon
enough of the nonsense uh nonsense said yin yin's mother poo poo
what sort of nonsense is this for a young papa for a young panda bear going to the moon indeed nonsense
your job is to be cut is to be cute so people want to run to the gift shop and buy panda bear dolls
it's simple economics like it or not we are spokespeople for the panda stuffed animals
sil
animal industry w which young lady helps pay for the bamboo that you eat
such nonsense going to the moon said her mother poo poo
<br> but i just learned now how to make myself into a ball and roll two days ago and i'm becoming very good at it
i don't think it will take that long to roll there said yin yin
yin yin's father moo man didn't think it was a very p proper or wise for a young panda bear to go rolling off to places where there wasn't any bamboo
but <unk> he was supportive of his young daughter and showed his support by taking a nap
but before he fell asleep he did manage to say i believe rolling is a decideable
sil
decideally round about way to go
if you must go it
sil
it would be best to fly
nonsense said the mother
i'm so mad i'm going to look at at a lady over there and make her want to squeeze her son cheeks
<unk> she was spit spiteful
sil
spitefully
an instant later a young boy was heard saying ouch mom cut that out
<unk> yin yin was always one to take good advice from her father and less than a week later yin yin and maggie had built a rocket ship out of bamboo
bamboo is very workable sub substance and pandas tend to handle bamboo a lot a lot so this is itself was not that astonishing at least to yin yins parents
fred was impressed though
the the main obstacle it turns out was getting the rocket ship off the ground
maggie figured that if her and three of the strongest magpie friends were to each grab hold of the corner of the rocket ship they could all fly to the moon
<unk> so they tried
one two three to the moon they said together pulling
sil
pulling with all their might
i see your wings flapping but we don't seem to be going anywhere said yin yin
hmm heavier than i thought i think we will need more magpies said maggie
yes but how many more yin yin said
i'm not exactly qui i'm not sure exactly replied maggie
the father watching this i this is all through one eye for he always had at least one eye asleep at all times
said it te would be best to ask the owl then closed his eyes his eye
so maggie flew to the old owl and asked for his advice
oh wise owl i have a question that i fear only you can answer she said
how to turn
sil
turn your head all the way around without getting a terrible pain in your neck said the owl
no how many magpies would be needed to fly a four hundred pound panda bear and one hundred pound bamboo rocket ship to the moon said maggie
the owl inti instantly replied two hundred thousand and six and seventy six give it or take two
sil
a week later maggie managed to round up two hundred thousand and seventy eight magpie
sil
she could be a very persuasive little bird when she wanted
sil
<br> a week later despite much flapping there were sti they they were still trying and to get the rocket in the air
it turns out that the owl didn't take into consideration that once you get over one thousand magpie together they tend to fight and can't agree o on a single thing
now while all this was going on what do you suppose fred was doing
why he was feeding the pandas like he was supposed to
so one day after fred fred had fed the pandas and was hugging the palm tree the zoo manager came up to him and said
what is going on with your pandas fred i've never seen anything like it
oh well that makes sense then said the manager
do you know that since the little panda built that bamboo rocketship and those magpie's started fluttering about that
sil
that the zoo's profits have gone up four thou four thousand percent
this is just the type of exposure we need those pandas will be with us for a long time
fred thought about it you know i think we should rename yin yin columbus
the zoo keeper said good heavens man that is a great idea
now no wait a second i don't understand
well sir when columbus set
sil
out on his ship he was really trying to find a quick quicker way to get around europe in order to improve trade
he wanted to be a business man but instead became became a great explorer
yes but what does that have to do with the pandas na pandas pandas man said the zoo manager
well it seems to me sir that yin yin wanted to be a great explorer and instead became a business woman
i see fred one morning one more thing sir
sil
about those magpies flying above the pandas do you think that the zoo could purchase me a large size umbrella
the zoo manager laughed and walked away but did purchase a fashionable yellow umbrella for fred the next day
back in the panda's home the mother panda poo poo was very proud of her daughter after all
sil
if it weren't for yin yin they would have had to move from their wonderful home
<br> but later when fred walked into the panda's home under his new
sil
yellow umbrella all she could think of was nonsense
as for yin yin she was very proud to be renamed after a famous explorer <unk> and she and magpie never stopped trying to get to the moon
the panda is about this <unk>
sil
ok uhm the panda the story of the panda is about a panda named yin yin and her friend uhm magpie and they want to go to the moon
and so they made this rocketship out of bamboo and magpie had to collect uhm <br> i think it was two thousand uhm seventy five magpies to carry the bamboo rocket and the panda to go to the moon
and they found out that that many magpies keep fighting and they never agree so that didn't work
and the zookeeper <br> uhm <br> his name was fred
when he went into the cage to feed the panda's he would get all warm inside and he wasn't allowed to hug the panda's so he'd run outside and hug a palm tree
outside the cage and since uh the panda and her friend the magpie built the rocketship the <br> uhm per
the zoo kept getting more money and so the fred uhm <br> let's see so and fred decided well maybe we can get even more people if we rename the panda's name colombus
uhm f rename it columbus and so they named yin yin the panda columbus because they thought that columbus would be a good name from columbus the explorer
because they were trying to make a rocketship and go to the moon and trying to explore
sil
but and she didn't want her to be an explorer
up in and she didn't want her to go to the moon
and the dad was sort of supportive of his daughters ideas but he was always sleeping and so
the red leaves were blown around in millions by the wind
behind lay the ship a picture no not without his lighter side
and meanwhile by the further river bank came rosalind with mushrooms in her skirt
now go and answer your note and let me finish this splendid <unk> story
more courage than my poor brother who stands like a coward
she rushed frantically across the apartment seized her hood and ran from the cottage

they carry themselves as fast as they had been drilled both men and women

sil
rooster john
before i tell you how the rooster john got his name you should know a little bit about the town franksville
franksville was a town that seemed to have one problem after another
the problem started when they ran out of water thankfully someone was digging a hole and found
sil
they got tons and tons of flies
then the flies stopped but just then a man moved into
sil
town who played the flute so badly that people would run away screaming
<br>
maybe a poorly p played flute doesn't sound all that bad but just trying to image someone screaching an a chalkboard with a fork and then multiply that a hundred t times a hundred
that's how the flute sounded when it when this guy played it
i'm serious still it's not a bad as bad as millions of flies i suppose
<br> the bad flute player was rooster john he wasn't called rooster john yet
<br>
that came later he just new
sil
new town dentist
he was ex an excellent dentist but real love was music
he played musical instruments such as the guitar the tuba the piano and the clarinet
however for some reason the way his mouth was shaped made his flute sound awful
sil
we can't let you play with the flute anymore john said the police chief sanders
the neighbors are complaining and the cats and dogs are trying to chew off their ears
but i have to play i was born to do it i know why but i feel like i have to or else bad things will happen
look john i've heard you play the clarinet you qui you're quite good why don't you play the that instead the chief s said chief sanders
oh that's nice instrument but that's not the flute
i even wrote a song
sil
chief sanders i called it cops and robbers
then he played the song the police chief hated the sound so much that he threw john in jail but he couldn't keep john in jail since he was already breaking any laws
so there was nothing the police could do besides everybody loved john since he had become the town dentist everybody's teeth were much whiter and cleaner and no one had any cavities
<br> so there was a problem in the t little town of franksville
what would they do they couldn't keep john in jail and they couldn't want to kick him out of the town because they all had such nice teeth
so they decided that john could play the flute and everybody else would have to wear earplugs
well i'm sure you guessed that it didn't work so no one could hear anything
people were getting into cars car accidents and everybody looked really silly at dances dancing to music they couldn't hear they just couldn't
sil
lead a normal li life
<br> then they decided to lower him down a well <unk> let him play where there were no one could hear him
john thought he was ask an ok idea but the louder the echo that well made the flute sounded louder
windows were breaking and all the cows in the town started to make sour milk
though local dentist doctor wrong came up with an idea he taught he thought that if he made a new mouthpiece especially shaped for john's mouth then perhaps he could play the flute normally
and guess what it worked doctor wong in the town hero
the flute sounded normal and it turned out john could play it quite well
the people in franktown decided to have a great big parade in frankville so celebrated in fact for once there was no water problem no no fly problem and no flute problem
doctor wong and john were stars of the parade
they were up in the main float as big band played as they marched up and down main street
everyone cheered
<br>
then suddenly a fly landed on a little girl then a fly landed on someone else then some landed on a bunch of people
it was pretty soon there were tons of flies landing on everyone for they knew it
sil
but the town was filled with flies again
sil
oh no said the chief sanders just when things were going good for franksville
sil
john didn't know what to do so he kept playing his flute
the flies were annoying so he would swat them with his hand or even a f his new flute
he started shaking the flute to get the flies off and accidentally smashed into pieces
he was very upset at first then he said oh well got good thing i brought my old flute back up
no no please don't play the old flute begged doctor wong
they had to cover their ears from the horrible sound
the flies would land all over the people they couldn't swat them off it was gross
then suddenly the flies flew away as fast as they could
doctor wong thought for a second then pronounced it's the flute sound the flies hate john's flute playing has much as we do
john the dentist was trying to driving the flies away
it was then <unk> that people of franksville realized that they wouldn't have to take god good with them the bad
because as bad as the flute sounded it was a lot better than thousands of flies crawling on them from
sil
then on john would wake up at sunrise like a rooster and play to keep the flies away
sil
ok so the story was mainly about th this guy named john and his flute
but when he played it it sounded really bad so but there was all these problems like there was no water flies were were was tons of flies everywhere
and so then he
sil
played his flute and it'd drive them away and then he got a new flute so it didn't sound as bad and the flies liked it so they came back
but then he his flute broke trying to swat flies in the parade
so he uhm was lucky that he brought his other flute and he played it and drives all those flies away
that's pretty much what it's about
sil
they tried to get earplugs so they couldn't hear it but then there's car accidents and people were getting hurt and so doctor wong tried to he made a new flute
for him and it didn't sound bad
sil
and the police chief didn't like it so he threw him in jail but he had to take him out cause he wasn't disobeying any laws so he took him out
ok the earl's next speech dashed that hope into a thousand fragments
sil
gracious ain't that a lot of aw an awful lot of money exclaimed davy crockett
sil
this little john did though without disturbing his master or rising from where he sat
sil
the next moment he changed the subject because it seemed the best thing to do
harrison chuckled if he chuckled at all in private it was all sympathy outwardly
sil
hearing these words jim resolved to conquer his alarm by himself
sil
the women replied only by vanishing as though suddenly mixed with the air
then he seemed to breathe more freely and recovered from hi recovered some of his jaunty impudence <unk>
sil

isn't he known as the most brilliant journalist in new york
why i'm hardly acquainted with you cried anne indignantly
sil
sil
sil
now all the people rejoiced because the wicked king should rule them no longer
sil
the panda
sil
why did a panda with the beautiful girl name yin yin have her name changed to the very un beautiful girl name columbus
<br> it was fred's idea so let's begin with fred
fred fed the panda bears the tigers and the turtles
the turtles weren't so bad but as for the tigers he wasn't so sure
he didn't mind handling the raw meat he had to feed th to the tigers
his main objection was be to being eaten
sil
no one could blame fred really since no one really wants to be eaten
some people do like to bite their finger nails but fred wasn't a nail biter so being eaten was definitely not something he looked forward to
sil
fred wait each afternoon at three o'clock when it was time to feed the tigers
<unk> for fred when it came to the pandas he had a warm spot in his heart
actually it was eighty five point five degree spot on his left kidney but the point was that he was very fond of feeding the pandas
there were three pandas and they were known as the pan family
there were they were in order of cuteness yin yin the younger daughter poo poo the mother and moo man the gentle and always sleepy father
sil
many people know the that pandas eat bamboo a lot of it and a lot of bamboo can get quite heavy
so because of the pandas fred became very strong and was in terrific shape
<unk> but physical fitness was not only the only reason that fred loved the pandas
the other reason was that anyone who gets within three feet of a panda automatically falls in love with them it's a law of nature
as at futher distances pandas have a strange almost magical effect on human beings which makes us want to hug and squeeze things
fred was not allowed to actually hug the panda bears since that could be dangerous
so all the other people in the zoo would know that the pandas had just been fed when they saw fred hugging the rather uncuddly palm tree outside the pandas home
<br> it's interesting to point out at this time that more stuffed panda bears are sold at zoo gift shops than all of the other stuffed animals combined
this can almost certainly be accounted for by the strange almost magical effect that the pandas possess
but everything was not all bamboo and hugs at the zoo
one morning fred was feeding yin yin and said oh yin yin i wish that more people would come and visit the zoo
i know i shouldn't be telling you this but we might have to sell you and your family to the big zoo in san san angeles if we don't get more money
it's not that you aren't selling enough stuffed panda bears it's just that you haven't been there haven't been enough people coming to see you in the first place
i think that the zoo needs a great advertising campaign
sil
fred was starting to feel the uncontrollable urge to hug the panda so before he ran off to hug the palm tree he quickly said
it costs so much to feed you panda bears i would ha i w i would hate if you had to leave us
sil
after all it's only home you know it's the only home you know
besides if you leave i'll get terribly out of shape now if you excuse me i need to squeeze something before i scream
but yin yin the young panda was not listening to fred she was talking to her best friend maggie the magpie about going to the moon
yes the big one in the sky that is most likely not made of cheese and most certainly not made of bamboo
yin yin and her best friend maggie the magpie who looked a lot like a panda would look would look if pandas were birds were discussing about going to the moon
her mother and father knew what they were talking about since they hadn't thought or talked of much else since yin yin said i want to go there and pointed to the moon
enough of this nonsense said yin yin's mother poo poo what sort of nonsense is this for a young panda bear going to the moon indeed moon indeed
nonsense
sil
your job is to be cute so people want to run to the gift shop and buy panda bear dolls
it's simple econ economics
<unk>
like it or not we are spokespeople for the panda stuffed animal industry which young lady helps pay for the bamboo that you eat
such nonsense going to the moon said her mother poo poo
<unk> but i just learned how to make myself into a ball and roll two days ago and i've become very and i'm becoming very good at it
i don't think it will take that long to roll there said yin yin
yin yin's father moo man didn't think it was very proper or wise for a young panda bear to go rolling off to places where there wasn't any bamboo
but he was supportive of his young daughter and showed support by taking a nap
but before he fell asleep he did manage to say i believe rolling is decidedly round about way to go if you must go t'would be nice to be it t'would be best to fly
nonsense said the mother i'm so mad i'm going to look at the lady over there and make her want to squeeze her son cheeks she said spitefully
an instant later a young boy heard was heard saying ouch mom cut that out
i'm sorry to say but many a boy little boy's cheeks have been made raw when mother poo poo panda was upset
<br> yin yin has was always one to take good advice from her father
sil
and less than a week later yin yin and maggie had built a rocket ship out of bamboo
bamboo is very workable substance and pandas tend to handle bamboo a lot so this in itself was not that astonishing <unk> at least to yin yins parents fred sure was impressed though
the main obstacle it turns out was getting the rocket ship off the ground
maggie figured if she and the three of her strongest magpie friends were to each grab hold of a corner of the rocket ship they could all fly to the moon so they tried
one two three to the moon they said together pulling with all their might
i see your wings flapping but we don't seem to be going anywhere said yin yin
hmm heavier than i thought i think we'll need more magpies said maggie
yes but how many more yin yin said
sil
i'm not sure exactly replied maggie
the father watching this all through one eye for he always had at least one eye uhm one eye asleep at all times said t'would be best to ask the owl then closed his eye
so maggie flew to the owl asked for his advice
oh wise owl i have a question that i fear only you can answer she said
no how many magpie's would be needed to fly a four hundred pound panda bear to and a one hundred pound bamboo rocket ship to the moon said maggie
the owl instantly replied two hundred thousand and seventy six give or take two
a week later maggie managed to round up two hundred thousand seventy eight magpie she could be very persuasive little bird if she wanted
sil
a week later despite much flapping they were still trying to get the rocket in the air
it turns out that the owl didn't take into consideration that once you get over a thousand magpie together they tend to fight and can't agree on a single thing
now while all this was going on what do you suppose fred was doing why he was feeding the pandas like he was supposed to
so one day after fred had fed the pandas and was hugging the palm tree the zoo manager came up to him and said what is going on with your panda fred i've never seen anything like it
it's taken me a couple of weeks to figure it out but i think yin yin wants to go to the moon and the magpies want to take her there said fred
oh well that makes sense then said the manager did you know that since the little panda built that bamboo rocket ship those magpie's started fluttering about and the zoo's profits have gone up four thousand percent
this is just the type of exposure we needed those pandas will be with us for a long time
sil
fred thought about it and said you know i think we should rename yin yin columbus
the zoo keeper said good heavens th that is a great idea no wait a second i don't understand
well sir when columbus set out on his ship he was really trying to find a quicker way to get around europe in order to improve trade he wanted to be a business man but instead became a great explorer
yes but what does that have to do with the pandas man said the zoo keep manager
well it seems to me sir that yin yin wanted to be a great explorer instead of a business woman
i see fred one more thing sir about those magpies flying above the pandas do you think that the zoo could purchase me a large sized umbrella
back at the panda's home the mother panda poo poo was very proud of her daughter after all if it weren't for yin yin they would have had to move from their wonderful home
but later when fred walked into the panda's home under a his new yellow umbrella all she could think was to say was nonsense
<br> as for yin yin she was very proud to be renamed after a famous explorer and she and maggie never stopped trying to get to the moon
ok well uhm there's three panda's a family of panda there's the dad and the mom and the little girl named yin yin and she wants to go to the moon
sil
and her best friend is a magpie and they try to go to the moon and they build a rocketship out of bamboo but they can't really get to the moon and then they have to get a whole bunch more of the magpies and they still can't get to the moon
but the problem was the panda's were trying they were they the people were t not coming to the zoo sort of and so they wanted to they might have to get rid of the panda's and send them to a bigger zoo
because they weren't making enough of a profit
and the keeper for the panda's was fred and he didn't want that to happen and so he he he kind of liked that they were doing that and so yin yin decided to do that and
she's still trying but she can't really get to the moon
but it did increase the popularity
so lots more people coming now and so they could keep the panda bears
sil
and that's about it
sil
okay fred he was the zoo keeper for them he also took care of the tigers and one other animal that i forgot
and he uhm liked the panda's the best though
but whenever he got close to them he wanted to hug them so he'd have to go away really quick
and hug the palm tree outside of their cages and so it must have looked kind of weird
and he really liked the panda's and
sil
he got really really strong from carrying their bamboo cause it weighed a lot
and they had to eat a lot of it so he got really strong carrying all their bamboo and so he's really fit
sil
i think i see pearls and diamonds come out of the girl's mouth
what if he had brains and military skills and all that sort of thing
sil
sil
yes said anne candidly <unk> i've heard that you and he were engaged once
sil
he had gentle and refined features and his voice was soft and pleasant in tone
sil
one would suppose that they knew nothing at all about school affairs but they do
it was a deep dazzling lovely blue deeper than the deepest blue of the s of the sky
sil
at practically
sil
the same instant the third shot whistled from the east
sil
a shadow that chilled his heart seemed gradually to fall upon him
sil
it never occurred to him that she might be ch she might be changed herself
sil
good friend said the other gently i have business elsewhere
sil
sil
thereupon i told the king without any reserve at all that had happened
sil
hans went up and down the streets of amsterdam that day looking for work
sil
yes said ben immensely revealed to find that no offense had been taken
the shovels were crowded with dust
sil
sil
worst dose <unk> i ever endured and i'd nothing to do but swelter in that heat
utensils of all sorts
she gathered up the moss and the remains of the beeswax
sil
he has broken no words of the law of the jungle
sil
that's a good dog anyone can tell that
sil
the king thought and thought frowned hard and rubbed his ears
sil
what are those foolish bundles in the back of that silly cart
sil
sil
but i'm awfully hungry i wish you'd get me something to eat
sil
marco only stood quite quiet still and looked at him with understanding and gravity
sil
the airplane ride
the first time i ever took an airplane by myself it was fun and scary
i didn't know anyone at all and i had to go all the way from new york to texas without my parents
i was flying there to see my grandfather and we were going to go fishing
<unk> i've always thought flying was fun you go higher than any mountain and you go faster than any car
<unk> but i tell you the truth without my parents there i was pretty nervous
i guess it was because the plane was so loud and i didn't know anybody or anyone
i started thinking we might crash i didn't like to think about that but i couldn't help it
that's when i missed my parents the most but once the plane was in the air i was pretty good
my mom gave me a coloring book of cool looking dragons to keep me busy i colored the dragon pictures all green so it didn't take very long
i only used the green crayon because it was the tallest and i wanted it to catch up to the red brown blue yellow purple and black ones
sil
one thing about being by yourself on your on an airplane is that the flight attendants are very nice to you
i had seven colas and four ginger ales which made me have to go to the bathroom eight times
i was glad that there wasn't any anyone next to me the person that sat next to me
sil
would have been very annoyed
sil
eventually the flight attendant seemed to get a little annoyed that i had to go the bathroom so much
but it was her fault <unk> she was the one that kept trying to give me peanuts
i told her that i wanted a banana split instead but she said they don't have any banana splits on the plane
but sometimes people like to eat peanuts on their banana splits i told her that i was that the peanuts that were making me so thirsty in the first place
and if she would get me a banana split i would i wouldn't have to go the bathroom as much so much
she told me to be quiet and watch the movie
i tried to watch the movie but i had already seen that one so it was boring
the flight attendant gave me a deck of cards but she wouldn't play go fish with me
sil
she said that she had to help other passengers
sil
i had a game boy in my backpack my backpack was o in the overhead thingy
i tried to push the button that lights up the over head so the flight attendant could would come
but i but guess what i was too short to reach the button so i stared started yelling hey peanut lady hey peanut lady
she didn't like being called peanut lady but she did get me the game or get me my game boy
sil
she told me to call her jennifer instead i played on my game boy until i got a new high s my new high score
then jennifer came up to me and said <unk> she had a surprise i thought great more peanuts but it wasn't peanuts it was something really cool
she said the captain was inviting me to see the cockpit i thought awesome <unk> i also brought my deck of cards in case the pilot was bored and wanted to play go fish
<br> jennifer took me to the cockpit and there were
sil
a million buttons and levers and knobs and stuff
at first i thought wow look at all those buttons then i thought there's no way that anyone can remember to push all those buttons at the right time are we going to crash
sil
the way i figured it my game boy or the way i figured it my game boy only has five buttons and i can get past level three
imagine how hard it would be to work all those millions of buttons and eat peanuts
the pilot told me that it wasn't really the hard one hard once you practice
and he told me that he w he once played a game i had on my game boy
sil
and he couldn't even pass level one i said
sil
if you can't even get past level one and you're a pilot then i could be a pilot s too since i'm much better at pushing buttons than you
he laughed even though i wasn't joking
he said he thought i would make a really great pilot someday if i wanted to be
sil
if i wanted to be a pilot
he was really nice but he wouldn't play go fish with me <unk>
finally we landed that's always scary it seems like the plane is going too fast to ever stop but it does
when i got off the airplane there was grandpa <unk> waiting for me he said how wa how was your flight
i said someday i'm going to be a pilot i'll only serve banana splits on my plane
grandpa laughed and i to and i took
sil
it and took me straight to the ice cream shop
it was worth the the whole trip to just eat a banana split with grandpa
ok well i think it's about a little boy maybe a little girl because he plays a gameboy or she plays a gameboy
and he goes to see his grandpa
sil
and he gets kind of nervous because he's taking a plane by himself and he gets kind of used to it and
sil
he lands and he's really happy to see is grandpa
sil
and that's about it
sil
well he played gameboy and
sil
i don't know if he played cards but it didn't seem like he played cards ti ate peanuts and talked with the flight attendant a little bit drank sodas
sil
well he colored all the pages green because he wanted his green crayon which was the tallest crayon to match his other crayons and so all the pages with dragons were green i guess
sil
well i would be annoyed if i was the flight atttendant
because i mean i couldn't eat that much peanuts i would not want to give out that much peanuts
and if that little boy or girl was annoying me that much i don't know what i'd do
so i'd probably say there's no banana splits on the plane either if there was still
<br> after the usual ceremonies the prince presented his proposal
rather i would face three strong men than one young damsel <unk>
i would love dearly to hear these people describe their travels
throughout these conversations sam hodge seldom spoke
now he has gone off again for the game is getting scarce
yes my lord said the man his sunburned face reddening
sil
if there has been some little mistake what c could i do now to fix it
<br> even if there has been some little mistake oops okay
for several days this strategy assorted the strangely assorted pair roamed the jungle together
the earl looked at it and the corners of his mouth twitched a little
<br> for you and me there is nothing to hope for nothing beyond what we have
if god spares beth i never will complain again whispered meg earnestly
these thoughts haunt him haunted him all day and he dreamt them all last night
for nothing brings joy to the heart like the coming of spring
sil
she could see nothing except the morning glories which covered the side of the porch
we never knew that strange people existed anywhere in the world
<br> she must begin with the chinese dynasty <unk> and end with japan
in the deep gloom she could not see the she could see the anger which darkened his face
she wants to give that boy an extremely bad opinion of me
diana searched faithfully but no axe was to be found in the whole woodshed
i know the county stock law just as well as you do
sil
how strange that a live animal should be should grow on a stalk like a flower
<br> i guess i'll buy a few snakes since they look so funny <unk> funny coiling out
sil
see the wisdom of my choice he said holding up the large leaf of gold
but i am old to endure your shame and my miseries much longer
sil
<br>
the panda
it was fred's idea so let's begin with fred

sil
but i just learned how to make myself into a ball and roll two days ago and i've become and i'm becoming coming very good at it

<br> yin yin always

hmm heavier than i thought i think we'll need some more magpies said maggie
yes but how do we get more yin yin said
i'm not sure exactly replied maggie
<br> the father watching all this through one eye for he always had at least one eye asleep at all times said
sil
t'would be the best to ask the old owl then closed his eye
oh wise owl i have a question that i fear only you can answer he said
how to turn your head all the way around without getting a terrible pain in your neck said the owl
no how many people how many magpie's would it would be needed to fly a four hundred panda bear to the
sil
and a one hundred pound ba bamboo rocket ship to the moon said maggie
the owl instantly replied two hundred s thousand seventy six give or take two
a week later maggie managed to round up two hundred thousand and seventy eight magpies
sil
she could be very she could be a very persuasive little bird when she wanted to be
a week later despite much flapping they were still trying to get the rocket into the air
it turns out that the owl did not take in consideration that once you are over a thousand magpie together they tend to fight and don't agree on a single thing
now while all this was going on what do you suppose fred was doing
why he was the feeding the pandas like he was supposed to

this is just the type of exposure we needed these those pandas will be with us for a long time
fred thought about it and said you know i think we should rename yin yin columbus
the zoo keeper said good heavens man that is a great idea now wait a second i don't understand
well sir columbus set out on a ship he was really to trying trying to find a quicker way to get to get around the w europe in order to improve improve trade
he wanted to be a business man but instead he became a great explorer
yes but does that have what does that have to do with the pandas man the zoo ke said the zoo manager
well it seems to me sir said yin yin <unk> that yin yin wanted to be a great explorer and instead became a business woman
i see fred
sil
one more thing sir those magpies flying about the pandas do you think the zoo could purchase me a large size umbrella
the zoo manager laughed and walked away but di but did purchase a fashionable yellow umbrella for fred the next day
back in the panda's home the mother panda poo poo was very proud of her daughter
after all if it weren't for yin yin they had to move from their wonderful home
but later f when fred walked into the panda's home under his new yellow umbrella all that she could think o to say was nonsense
as for yin yin she was proud to be very renamed after the famous explorer and she and magpie never stopped trying to get to the moon
and she did it because she wanted to go to the moon and so she and her friend maggie the magpie uhm built a rocketship and got a bunch of magpies to help fly it
but uh it didn't work but it brought a lot of people uhm to come watch them do it cause it was really interesting and so the zoo got lots of money
and they named her and they renamed yin yin columbus because columbus w when he tried to sail around europe he uhm <unk> he wanted
sil
he was exploring to find a way to uhm an easier way to go around europe so the trade would be easier
and uhm <br> so but he wanted to be a business man but he ended being an ex explorer
and yin yin wanted to be an explorer but she ended up being a businesswomen because
uhm she brought lots of business to the a zoo
sil
ok
sil
uhm fred is
sil
he feeds the pandas and he always cause when he's near the panda's it always makes him want to hug something
so and he's not allowed to hug the panda's so everyday after he feeds the panda's he goes and hugs a tree
sil

and in the end uhm cause of all the seagulls he got a yellow umbrella to use while he was feeding the panda's i mean not the seagulls the magpies

so all the other people at the zoo would know that the pandas had just been fed when they saw fred hugging a rather un cuddly palm tree outside the panda's home
sil
sil
this can almost certainly be accounted for by this strange almost magical effect that the panda possess
sil
<unk> but everything was not all bamboo and hugs at the zoo
one morning fred was feeding yin yin and said y oh yin yin i wish i w that more people would come visit the zoo
i know i shouldn't be telling you this we might be able to sell but we might have to sell you
sil
and your family to the big zoo in san angeles an that's san angeles okay uhm if we don't <unk> get enough money
sil
it's not that you aren't s coming
sil
selling enough stuffed panda bears it's just that we that there haven't been enough people coming to the zoo
i think the zoo need is a great advertising campaign campaign <unk>
so before he ran off to hug a palm tree he quickly said it costs more so much to feed you panda bears i would hate if you had to leave us
after all it's the only home you know besides if you leave i'll get terribly out of shape
now if you you'll excuse me i need to squeeze something before i scream
but yin yin the young panda was not listening to fred she was talking to her best friend maggie the magpie <unk> about going to the moon
yes the big one in the sky that is most likely to not be made of cheese and most certainly not made out of bamboo
yin yin's <unk> and her best friend maggie the magpie who looked <unk> a lot like a panda would <unk> look if
sil
her mother and father knew what <unk>
sil
knew what knew what
sil
they were talking about since they hadn't taught thought or talked much else since yin yin said i want to go there <unk> and pointed to the moon
<unk> enough of this nonsense said yin yin's mother poo poo
sil
what sort of nonsense is this for a young panda bear going to the moon indeed nonsense
<br> your job is to be cute so people want to run to the gift shop and buy panda bear dolls
it's simple economics like it or not we are spokespeople for pandas for panda stuffed animals industry which young lady helps pay for the bamboo you eat
such nonsense going to the moon s said her mother poo poo
sil
<unk>
sil
<unk> but i just learned how to make myself into a ball and roll two days ago
sil
i've becoming very good at it i don't think it will take that long to roll there said yin yin
sil
<unk>
sil
<unk> yin yin's father moo man didn't think it was very proper or wise for a young panda bear to go rolling off to places where she there wasn't any bamboo
but he was supportive of his daughter and showed his support by taking a nap
sil
t'wouldn't be best to fly
nonsense said the mother <unk> i'm so mad i'm gonna going to <unk>
sil
look at that young that lady over the there and make her want to squeeze her sons cheeks
sil
<unk> she said spitefully
an instant later
sil
a young boy was heard saying ow mom cut that out
i'm sorry to say but many little boy's cheeks have been made raw when mother poo poo panda was upset
<br> yin yin was always the one to take good advice from her father
sil
and less than a week later yin yin and maggie had built a rocket ship out of bamboo
bamboo is very uh very workable substance
sil
<unk> and pandas tend to handle bamboo a lot so <unk> this in itself was not so astonishing
at least to the yin yin's parents fred sure was impressed though
sil
the main obstacle it turns out was getting the rocket ship off the ground
maggie figured if she and three of the her strongest magpie friend were to each grab hold of one corner of the rocket ship <unk> they could fly to the moon so they tried
one two three to the moon they said together pulling with all their might
i see your wings flapping but i don't see them going anywhere said yin yin
hmm heavier than i thought i think we'll need more magpies
yes but how many more i'm not sure exactly replied maggie
the father watching this all through one eye for he always had at least one eye asleep at all times <unk> said
<unk> t'wouldn't it be best to ask owl then he closed an eye
so maggie flew to owl and asked for advice
oh wise owl i have a question that i fear y only you can answer
how to turn your head all the way around
sil
without getting a terrible pain in your neck o said owl
<br> no how many magpies would it
sil
would be needed to fly a four hundred pound panda bear and a one hundred pound bamboo rocket ship to the moon
the owl instantly replied two hundred thousand seventy six give or take two
sil
<unk> a week later m maggie managed to round up two hundred thousand and seventy eight magpies
she could be be very persuasive a very persuasive little bird when she wanted
<br>
a week later despite much flapping they were still trying to get the rocket into the air
it turns out that the owl didn't take into consideration that once you get over one thousand magpies together they tend to fight and can't agree on a single thing
sil
<unk> now while all this was going on <unk> what do you suppose fred was doing
sil
why he was feeding the pandas like he was supposed to
one day after fred had fed the pandas a
sil
is going on
sil
after fred fed the pandas <unk> h and he was hugging a palm tree the zoo manager came up to him and said what's going on with your panda fred
i've never seen anything like it
it's taken me a couple of weeks to figure it out but i think
sil
yin yin wants to go to the moon and the magpie wants to take her there
sil
oh well that makes sense then
did you know that since the little panda c built the bamboo rocket ship and those magpies started fluttering about that the zoo's profits have gone up four thousand percent
this is just the type of exposure we needed <unk> those pandas will be with us for a long time <unk>
fred thought about it <unk> and said you know i think we should rename yin yin columbus
the zoo keeper said good heavens man that is a great idea
no wait a second i don't understand
<br> well sir when columbus got out set out on his ship he was really trying to find a
sil
quicker way to get around europe in order to improve trade he wanted to be a business man but instead he became a great explorer
sil
<unk> yes but why does <unk> that have to do with yin with the panda's name a said the zoo manager
well it seems to me sir yin yin wanted to be a great ex explorer but instead became a business woman
i see fred
one morning one more thing sir about those magpies flying above the pandas do you think that the zoo could purchase a large si me a large sized umbrella
the zoo manager laughed and walked away but he but did purchase a fashionable yellow umbrella for fred the next day
<unk> back in the panda's f <unk> home the mother panda <unk> poo poo was very proud of her daughter
after all if it weren't for yin yin
sil
they would have to move from their wonderful home
but later when fred walked into the panda's home under his new yellow umbrella umbrella she could think only to say nonsense
as for yin yin she was very proud to be renamed after a famous explorer and she she and the magpie maggie never stopped trying to get to the moon
what do you mean like uhm
sil
how it was or what it was about
or what i think it was a good story but uhm i didn't understand how the people could talk to the animals and the animals could talk to different types of animals that i just didn't understand but uhm
sil
<br> i liked how he thought up this clever name columbus at the end
sil
because it was just the opposite but uhm <br>
sil
and i liked how the panda wanted to go to the moon because i know that's a dream of many kids and i really liked the narratives like uhm
sil
actually it was a eighty five point five degrees spot on his left kidney but the point is that he was very fond of feeding the panda's or something like that and <br> <unk> it was a good story
this was the story about a panda who wanted to go to the moon <unk> but she couldn't until she had some necessary things
meanwhile the humans were thinking of sending the panda's to a different zoo because they weren't getting enough money into <br> but once she built a rocketship and got
uhm two thousand eighty eight magpies to try and carry the ro oh rocketship made out of bamboo their profits tripled by
i mean quadrupled <unk> well they got higher <br> and yeah <unk> ok that's all i can think of
sil
and
sil
there was the human that really fed them was named fred he was impressed by how these panda's did it
and then there was maggie the magpie who was
yin yin or now colombus's uhm best friend
<unk> there was yin yin
sil
uhm alias colombus uhm <br> and she
sil
got named columbus because she did e exactly the opposite thing that columbus did
she wanted to explore but she became a businesswoman not like colombus who wanted to be a uhm uh businessman but became an explorer
sil
they shook the floor floor flour off her and set her down on the kitchen floor
<br> i beg your pardon said the learned man it is an old habit with me
she saw that she was on the grass and the broken wheel beside her
sil
knowing then that if i tell you the reason i shall instantly die
aye i know said the da dame gently fearing to interrupt the story
you certainly are an able minded youngster hiram he observed
after dinner jordan crept up by way of the black back stairs to see her
they then they then journeyed onwards till they almost reached the mountains
and still she sat and still she reeled and still she wished for company

he tilted his hat brim to shade his face and looked for his chickens

it was that day when you got your toes your toe pounded added davie look looking at joel l joel
nan received a sewing machine to remind her of the fresh air work
we all looked at each other trying to glean something from each other
sil
diana shook her head gleefully her black eyes danced with merriment
sil
then he pulled the hood of his cloak over his ears and over his brow
which of you boys placed this this stone sig signal asked the young explorer
sil
the slowest turtle
every four years turtles
sil
from all over the land would crawl to great pond
<br> it would take some turtles from far away villages two whole weeks just to get there
<br>
when all the
sil
turtles arrived there was a seven day festival called the shell dwellers festival where there was lots of eating and laughing
turtles could catch up with friends they had not seen since last festival
everything about the festival was fun but the main event was the great turtle race
<br> the winner of the great <unk> turtle race was so important that he or she didn't have to move for four years until the next festival
the less a turtle moves the bigger they get and the longer they live so <unk> you can see winning the great the great race is a great honor
<br> the turtle cup was the trophy that the winner would take home to the village
<br> it wo it had been in
sil
sludge pond for over fifty years because no one could ever beat their turtle
<br> this was the most famous turtle there was he was the slowest turtle of all time
sil
he hadn't
sil
he hadn't had to move for over fifty years
he was the biggest most respected and also one of the trickiest turtles there was
there were many legends about him it was the it was rumored he was so slow his heart would only beat once a day
his name was mud and he was the greatest champion in the history of shell dweller's festival he was unbeatable
when mud was in his prime there was a new turtle born in blue pond
this turtle was named swish <unk> when swish was born everyone thought he was a little slow
<br> but he got a li a little older and tur the turtles began to realize that swish was really really really slow
<unk> once his mother called him in for dinner and he didn't make it home until breakfast the next morning and he was only a foot away
sil
blue pond was a nice village located about three days crawl from great pond
they all felt a little sad because they hadn't held the turtle cup in over seven hundred years
<br> so with swish they thought maybe just maybe he could bring back the turtle cup to their little pond
<unk> everyone treated swish differently
for example mister peeks the local shell cleaner would say hey there swish you want a free shell waxing today
we all want you to look good when you bring home the cup
ms snapper would say hi swishy do you want some yummy pie to fill you up and slow you down for the big race
<br> a fat turtle in the slow turtle a fat turtle is a slow turtle
ms snapper was never nice to anyone but she was nice to s swish
<br> mister peeks would never do anything for free but he was going to give swish a free shell waxing
this was the kind of thing that swish would get all the time
<br> all the extra attention made swish very uncomfortable he thought
sure they're nice to me now <unk> because they think i can win the race but if i lose they'll be disappointed and mad at me
<unk> i never promised that i would win the race i can't beat mud anyway i heard once it took him three days just to yawn
so one day he told his parents i don't want to race
all the turtles in blue pond held a meeting to discuss the problem
<br> the mayor doctor softshell said this is ridiculous swish has to race he's the slowest turtle i've every s <unk> every seen
sil
except for mud of course without him we don't have a chance
but he doesn't want to be treated special he just wants to be normal and doesn't want everybody to hate him if he can't beat mud
you have to remember that even though he's gifted at being slow he's very very young said swish's father
we never thought of that they all said
the town agreed to treat swish like a normal person and after a while swish decided that he would be proud to to race for his village
when the time of the festival drew near all the turtles in the land started toward great pond
<br> swish had to be carried on his father's back since it would have taken him months to get to the great pond by himself
finally after the long journey all the turtles arrived at great f pond
this was swish's first ever shell dwellers festival and he thought it was the most wonderful thing he had ever seen
<unk> there were thousands of turtles all of different species all having a great time
look there's your cousin peek a boo from big puddle village <unk> said swish's mother you'll get uhm get to meet all sorts of new turtles
swish was suddenly very excited he told his mom you know what i'm going to win this race
sil
i know it and all these turtles will know that blue pond rules i'm not afraid of stupid mud
swish's mom smiled and said i know that you can win swish but it's an honor just to get to the race said swish's mom
sil
swish saw a rock in the middle of the field and wondered how come they didn't move that big rock out of the field it seems to be in everyone's way
sil
said swish
that's not a rock sweetie <unk> said his mom that's mud
swish made a loud gulping sound just do your best said his mom
<unk> swishes father said son i have something to tell you as you know your great great grand turtle raced mud once
he wasn't as slow as you but he did teach about mud's
sil
dirty tricks then he whispered in swish's ear all the tricks that his great great grand turtle taught him
after seven days of playing and dancing <unk> and bug eating finally the day of the race came
the mayor of great pond
sil
ms tort p
sil
posted the t rules of the race on the tree for everyone to see
they read rule number one the great race begins at sunrise and ends at sunset
rule number two turtles all turtles must run as fast as they can and the turtle that is closest to the starting line wins
rule number three no turtle may pretend to be going fast but going go slow instead all turtle must go as fast as they can at all times
since turtle never cheat this is the most important rule to break this rule would mean an end to the great turtle race forever
rule number four no turtle may fall asleep since if you are asleep you aren't running as fast as you can
sil
swish read the rules even though he knew them by heart
then he heard the mayor said runner's please take your positions
the slowest turtles from each pond were carried to the starting line by members of their village
there were about three hundred turtles racing there were all the slowest of the slow the turtles all stretched
sil
and thought really slow thoughts as they did the sky turned ba turned from black to dark blue
they looked at the horizon and saw the sun was starting the rise just then the mayor said ready set slow and off they went
<br> all the turtles were very very slow so it took t took some time before anyone figured out which turtles was the slowest
after a few hours most of the turtles had gone a few feet all except two
swish and mud were both back at the starting line it looked as if neither of them had moved at all
<br> they were both moving of course but they were so slow that it was hard to tell
after six hours mud and s swish were still tied and had only moved a few inches
by now all the turtles were just were usually way ahead of mud but this time swish had was just as slow
<br> mud knew that this would be his closest race ever and he was actually getting a little bit scared
who is this young punk he thought to himself
sil
mud said to swish there's no way that a turtle as young as you can be so slow even i was faster than your than you when you i was your age
you're cheating you're going to ruin the great race forever
but swish wouldn't let mud scare him you're just trying to make me quit i'm not going to fall to your tricks
sil
he said turtles never cheat and i'm a turtle with honor
then mud tried another trick he started singing a soft beautiful lullaby
swish started yawning he was tired from racing and thought that if
sil
it would be that it would be nice to just listen to mud's sweet voice and fall asleep
then he snapped out of it and remembered his father had warned him of his of this trick
he reached in his shell and and pulled out a couple of earplugs
then put the earplugs in his ears and couldn't hear mud's singing anymore
mud kept singing his lullaby for a few hours but he stopped right before sunset <unk>
the crowd thought he must have realized that his singing trick wasn't working but then
sil
but then right at the end right before the sunset swish started to pull ahead of mud
oh no shouted the fans mud's winning
it looked like mud is still the greatest turtle of them all and when the sun went down mud was the closest turtle to the starting line
swish was sad that he lost but all the turtles from blue pond w cheered for swish
they were very proud
sil
he gave mud such a close race
swish was happy too but deep down i inside he knew he was just as slow as mud
the mayor of pondland went to present the turtle cup to sludge pond again
she announced well mud it looks like you're you've done it sludge pond wins the turtle cup again
this time it was a bit closer than you would have liked it
sil
i'll bet
what would you like to say to all the turtles at the festival
the crowd started yelling speech speech
mud didn't answer the mayor tapped mud on the shell and said hello hello mud
mud still didn't answer in fact mud was sound asleep mud had actually sung himself to sleep
sil
ladies and gentlemen she said mud from sludge pond has been disqualified for sleeping during the race
this means that we have a new champion the real winner is swish softbelly of blue pond
the crowd went wild ms tort went up to swish and gave him the turtle cup
she said swish you were the youngest winner of the great turtle race that was the most exciting finish we've ever had
i think that you will be a great champion for many years since turtles only get slower with age
for the first time in six hundred years i would like to present the turtle cup to blue pond the crowd went wild again
<unk> swish took the cup that day for the first time he would take it many more times after that
<unk> it was because of swish that blue pond became the most respected pond in the land
he would never lose the turtle cup for the rest of his long life
but though he became the greatest and biggest turtle of all time
much greater or bigger than mud
he <unk> always made sure that no one treated him special and that he treated everybody like he wanted to be treated like a turtle with honor
well the story was about a race which in turtles minds the way to win the race was to be the slowest and if you won the race by being the slowest you wouldn't have to move for the next four years until the next race and
sil
uhm
sil
it was about one young turtle beating another turtle that had been the champion of the race for like fifty years
sil
should i just re tell it
sil
the story the slowest turtle is about a young turtle and a race the race is a grand turtle race that happens every four years
and the way to win win this race is to instead of being fastest be the slowest
sil
and the
sil
champion of this race has been the champion for fifty years and then later on a young turtle named swish was born i think that's his name <br> uhm
sil
and swish ends up beating mud who was the former champion for more than fifty years and that's their story
sil
the race in the story the slowest turtle
sil
was very it lasted from
sil
sun up til sun down and uhm
sil
mud the former champion of the race and swish the uhm young turtle
sil
were neck and neck both tied for the slowest
sil
and uhm
sil
then mud started to try and play tricks on swish <br>
the first trick that he tried to play on him was trying to intimidate swish but swish's father before the race had told him not to fall for this so he outwitted mud by not falling for it
next
sil
mud tried to
sil
have swish disobey the rules by falling asleep during the race and try to sing him to sleep
but his father had also warned him swish about mud's uh that <br> mud's trick
sil
but even though mud tried to sing
sil
swish to sleep swish got out earplugs and uhm
sil
put them on <br> while mud kept singing and didn't realized that swish had the earplugs in mud sung himself to sleep so he was disqualified and swish won the race
the red leaves were blown around in millions by the wind
his boots creaked too so loudly but still he was not at all afraid
sil
still she will be glad to see you but she has been very badly frightened
sil
he turned his back on the boy and conferred <unk> aside with lawrence
sil
i desire it so much that i will take no refusal
sil
and the pr prize cup grew clearer and nearer to her mental vision
sil
sil
behind lay the ship a picture not without its lighter side
sil
and meanwhile by the further river bank came rosalind with mushrooms in her skirt
sil

ethel brown was seven years old she had a tea party
sil
seagrave knelt by his side took his hand and burst into tears
sil
nan said it wouldn't grow in our garden but i bought some brought some home to try
sil
sil
rooster john
<unk> before i tell you how rooster john got his name you should know a little bit about the town of franksville
franksville was a town that seemed to have one problem after the other
<unk> their problems started when they ran out of water
thankfully someone was digging a hole and found water but soon after they started to get flies
sil
they got tons and tons of flies
sil
then the flies stopped but just then a man moved into town who played the flute so badly that people would run away screaming
<unk> maybe a poorly played flute doesn't sound at all that bad but just try to imagine someone scratching a chalkboard with a fork and then multiplying that times a hundred
that's how the flute sounded when this guy played it <unk> i'm serious
still it's not as bad as millions of flies i suppose
the bad flute player was rooster john he wasn't called rooster john yet <unk> that came later
he was the new town dentist he was an excellent dentist but his real love was music
<br> he played many musical instruments such as the guitar the tuba the piano and the clarinet <unk>
however for some reason the way his mouth was shaped made his flute sound awful
sil
we can't let you play the flute anymore john said police sheriff sanders
the neighbors are complaining and the cats and dogs are trying to chew off their ears
<br> but i have to play i was born to do it <unk> i don't know why but i feel like i have to or else bad things will happen
look john i've heard you play the clarinet you're quite good why don't you play that instead said chief sander sanders
oh that's a nice instrument but it just not the flute i even wrote you a song chief sanders it's called cops and robbers
then he played the song the police ch ch ch che uh
sil
uhm
sil
the police chief hated the sound so much that he threw john in jail
<br> but they couldn't keep john in jail since he wasn't really breaking any laws
so there was nothing the police could do <unk>
besides everybody loved john since he had become the town dentist everybody's teeth were much whiter and cleaner and no one had any cavities
so there was a problem in the little town of franksville <unk>
what should they do they couldn't keep john in jail and they didn't want to kick him out of the of town because they all had such nice teeth
so they decided that john could play the flute and everybody else would have to wear earplugs
<unk> well i'm sure you guessed that didn't work
no one could hear anything people were getting into car accidents and everybody looked really silly at dances dancing to music they couldn't hear
<br> they just couldn't
sil
lead a normal life
<unk> then they decided to lower him down a well and let him play down where no one could hear him
john thought that was that was an ok idea but there was an echo in the well that made the flute sound louder
<unk> windows were breaking all the cows in town started to make sour milk
the local dentist doctor wong came up with an idea
<unk> he thought that if he made a new mouthpiece especially shaped for john's mouth then perhaps he could play the flute normally
and guess what it worked doctor wong was the town hero the flute sounded normal and it turned out john could play it quite well
<br> the people in town decided to have a great big parade in franksville and celebrate the fact that for no
sil
for once there was no water problem no fly fly problem and no flute problem
doctor wong and john were the stars of the parade they were up in the main float
a big band played as they marched up and down main street everyone cheered
then suddenly a fly landed on the a little girl
then a fly landed on someone else
then some landed on a bunch of people and pretty soon tons of flies were landing on everyone but before they knew it the town was filled with flies again
<unk> oh no cried chief cherub
sil
uhm <unk> oh no said chief sanders just when things were go going good for franksville
john didn't know what to do so he just kept on playing his flute
<br> then flies were annoying the flies were annoying so he would swat them all with his hands or even his new flute
<br> he started shaking the flute to get the flies off and accidentally smashed it into pieces
he was very upset at first then he said oh well good thing i brought my old flute as back up
no no please don't play your old flute begged doctor wong but it was too late john had started playing
when the townsfolk heard the noise they couldn't even swat the flies anymore
<br>
they had to cover their ears from the horrible sound
the flies would land all over the people and they couldn't swat them off it was gross then suddenly the flies flew away fast as they could
doctor wong thought for a second then pronounced it's the flute sound the flies hate john's flute playing as much as we do
john's dentist was driving the flies away
<br> it was then that people of franksville realized that they would have to take a good with take the good with the bad
because as bad as the flute sounded it was a lot better than thousands of flies crawling on them
from then on john would wake up at sunrise like a rooster and play to keep h the flies away
ok <br> so rooster john was about uhm uh this town where everything went wrong and uhm there was flies a lot of flies and they would bug the people
and uhm then there there was rooster john and uhm he played instruments and he was a the dentist for the people in franksville and uhm
sil
uhm he would play like the clarinet and the tu tuba or something i like lots of different instruments
and then he would play the flute but he was really bad at playing the flute and uhm it sounded like like a fork on a chalkboard
sil
and uhm so
sil
uhm the den the nobody liked to hear it and
sil
so uhm the dentist uhm mister
sil
mong or something <br> uhm he made he was a dentist too and so he made the rooster john a a special mouthpiece for his flute
and uhm then it he sounded normal and he was pretty good and but and then so they had a parade
and uhm they were in the head of the
sil
parade they were like on a big float of something <br> and uhm
sil
he started playing the flute and all these the the flies starting landing on the people that were watching the parade and then
sil
so so something happened to his flute and so he got out his old one and uhm he started to play that one and it sounded so bad that the all the flies flew away
cause they didn't like the noise of the flute either
so every morning uhm rooster john gets up and plays the hi the flute that sounds bad in the morning and all the flies go away

i really didn't mean to shave the cat really i swear
ok here's what happened as i remember it
i saw the cat was trying to get the gerbils and you told us we couldn't hit animals so i didn't know what else to do
so i grabbed dad's nose hair clippers and shaved it
you should be proud of me for thinking so fast on my toes
oh sure it's easy to say that i should have just picked the cat up but sometimes we don't always think all that great under pressure
and you know what those stupid gerbils didn't even thank me they just ran on that stupid wheel and did stupid things
that's the last time i ever shave the cat to protect any stupid gerbils
besides the real reason i shaved the cat was to keep it nice and cool
i just didn't want to see the cat getting all hot and uncomfortable and stuff
you guys will probably say you guys will just probably say it's winter danny cats don't overheat in winter
but so what if it's winter
i mean it'll be summer soon enough and i just wanted the cat to get used to the idea before it gets got really hot
plus oscar my turtle told me to shave the cat
fine oscar can't really talk but if he could he would have said please shave the cat
it keeps hitting me on the shell and trying to roll me over when you leave the room
you guys never liked oscar as much as the cat anyway
you wouldn't always take the cat's side if you knew the stuff he did to my poor turtle
cats aren't always nice just like my sister jenny isn't always nice
but the real reason i shaved the cat was to make a wig for those poor hair less cats that we saw on tv on the animal channel
i knew our cat would grow her fur back but some cats don't have hair
they are all hairless cat they are called hair less cats and they need fur in the winter sometimes i think i swear that's the reason
also i was going to sell the cat fur and buy my sister jenny braces for her big stupid face
plus i forgot to tell you that you should be blaming ms casper my science teacher
she made us shave something for science ask her
sil
she said that when we shave hair it grows back harder and sometimes even darker
so i thought that if i could shave the cat a lot of of bun a bunch of times her hair would grow back harder each time and soon she would have an invincible coat of cat fur armor
then she would be a super cat and you could take her on tv shows and get lots of money so that you can send jenny to college even if she is a dumb little tattle tale
she's so good at school and you bought her a cat cause she's just so responsible and stuff
just cause she's a good student doesn't mean she's really responsible
last night i saw that she didn't brush her teeth oh yeah i forgot to tell you that
<unk> dear mom and dad jenny didn't brush her teeth last night
i think that she should brush her teeth twice tonight <unk> that's just my opinion though
i'll bet you didn't know something else did you know that i wanted to be a barber
i was afraid to tell you the real reason i shaved the cat was that i want to be a barber and i needed practice
i was afraid you wouldn't let me practice on my own head can i practice by shaving jenny's head
i promise that i'll do a better job then i did on the cat cause now i have what dad calls life experience not that i shaved the cat though
actually the truth is that i by accident turned on the nose hair clippers and the cat was being chased by the turtle and ran right by the clippers and shaved herself
i kept saying no kitty no don't shave yourself but my stupid sister never taught her cat how to listen
so she just ignored me see she's not so responsible after all
if i had a cat i know i would teach it not shave itself that's for sure
i don't have to get good grades to know that you should teach a cat to shave itself
sil
plus if you weren't always cuddling with my sister so much maybe she would have been with her cat
instead the cat came into my room because jenny never plays with it enough
the cat liked being shaved anyway so i don't see the big deal
i think it really liked its haircut
the only reason it hasn't come out for two weeks is because you guys keep making such a big deal about it
poor kitty this and poor kitty that it's your fault really
dad please don't read the next part
dear mom don't let dad know that the real reason i shaved the cat was that he's always sneezing around it
i know how much you hate him sneezing and stuff so i thought if i got rid of his fur he wouldn't sneeze and that you'd have a better marriage
so it was really my father's day gift to him
<unk> i couldn't buy him anything nice since you took away my allowance for when i shaved the neighbor's dog
how come jenny gets a cat and i get a stupid turtle anyway
turtles don't do anything except poke their heads out and not be not cuddly
can i get a dog please
so in conclusion i'm getting hungry and i'm sorry for shaving the cat
although you can see that it's really jenny's fault for not being as responsible as you always say and not brushing her teeth
ps if you would've bought her a turtle i couldn't have shaved it
sincerely danny
uhm it's about a boy who shaved his cat and he's writing to his parents to tell them why he did it
sil
uhm that his sister wasn't responsible enough and that his dad was sneezing and that he wanted to give the hair of to one of his furless cat and that uhm the cat was always well the cat was going after his gerbil and so he wanted to stop it without hitting it

rooster john
<unk> before i tell you how rooster john got his name you should know a little bit about the town of franksville
franksville was a town that seemed to have one problem after after the other
<br> their problems started when they ran out of water
thankfully someone was digging a hole and found water but soon after that they started to get flies
they got tons and tons of flies then the flies stopped
but just then a man moved into town who played the flute so badly that people would run away screaming
<unk> maybe a poorly played flute doesn't sound all that bad
but just try to imagine someone scratching a chalkboard with a fork and then multiplying that times a hundred
that's how the flute sounded when this guy played it i'm serious still it's not as bad as millions of flies i suppose
<unk> the bad flute player was rooster john
he wasn't called rooster john yet that came later
he was the new he was the new town dentist
he was an excellent dentist but his real love was music
he played many musical instruments such as the guitar the tuba the piano and the clarinet
<unk> however for some reason the way his mouth was shaped made his flute sound awful
sil
we can't let you play the flute anymore john police chief sanders said
<unk> the neighbor the neighbors are complaining and the cats and dogs are trying to chew off their ears
but i have to but i have to play i was born to do it i don't know why but i feel like i have to or else bad things will happen
look john i've heard you play the clarinet you're quite good why don't you play that instead said chief sanders
oh that's a nice instrument but it's just not the flute
i even wrote you a song chief sanders i called it cops and robbers
sil
then he played the song the police chief hated the sound so much that he threw john in jail
<unk> but they couldn't keep john in jail since he wasn't really breaking any laws so there was nothing the police could do
besides everyone loved john
since he had become the town dentist everybody's teeth were much whiter and cleaner and no one had any cavities
so so there was a problem in the little town of franksville
<unk> what would they do they couldn't keep john in jail they didn't want to kick him out of town because they had such nice teeth
sil
so they decided that john could play the flute and everybody else would have to wear earplugs
<unk> well i'm sure you guessed that didn't work
no one could hear anything
people were getting into car accidents and everyone everybody looked really silly at dances dancing to music they couldn't hear
<unk> they just couldn't lead a normal life
they decided to lower him down a well and let him play down there where no one could hear him
john thought that was an ok idea but there was an echo in the well that made the flute sound louder
windows were breaking and all the cows in town started to make sour milk <unk>
the local scientist doctor wong came up with an idea
<br> he thought that if he made a new mouthpiece especially shaped for john's mouth <unk> then perhaps he could play the flute normally
and guess what <unk> it worked
doctor wong was the town hero
the flute sounded normal and it turned out john could play it quite well
the people in
sil
the town decided to have a great big parade in franksville <unk> to celebrate the fact that for once there was no water problem no fly problem problem and no flute problem
doctor wong and john were the stars of the parade
<unk> they were up on the main float a big band played as they marched up the town main street everyone cheered
then suddenly a fly landed on a little girl then a fly landed on someone else and then some landed some landed on a bunch of people
then pretty soon tons of flies were landing on everyone
before they knew it the town was filled with flies again
oh no said chief sanders just when things were g going good for franksville
john didn't know what to do so he just kept on playing his flute
the flies were annoyed so h he would swat them swat at them with his hand or even his new flute
<br> he started shaking the flute to get the flies off and accidentally smashed it into pieces
<br> he was very upset at first then he said oh well good thing i brought my old flute as back up
no no please don't play your old flute begged doctor wong but it was too late john had started playing
<unk> when the townsfolk heard the noise they couldn't even swat at the flies anymore they had to cover their ears from the horrible sound
the flies would land all over the people and they couldn't swat them off
it was gross then suddenly the flies flew away fast as they could
doctor wong thought for a second then pronounced it's the flute sound the flies hate john's flute playing as much as we do
john the dentist is driving the flies away
it was then that the people of franksville realized that they would have to take the good
sil
with the bad because as bad as the flute sounded it was a lot better than thousands of flies crawling on them
<unk> from then on john would wake up at sunrise like a rooster and and play to keep the flies away
<unk> done
ok there was
sil
there's a town that always has something bad happen then right after the problem's fixed something else bad happens
uhm and so first they
didn't have any water then they got that then all these flies came and then they got rid of the flies somehow <br> uhm and then this guy came <unk> and
sil
he liked playing the flute a lot and all sorts of other musical instruments and uhm
but the way it si since because his mouth was shaped a little bit funny uh when he played the flute it sounded awful
<br>
and uhm <unk> so the townspeople didn't know what to do cause he was also their dentist and a really good one too
so they didn't know what to do because they liked him he was a good dentist but they hated his flute playing and he wouldn't stop
sil
so uhm and then eventually this so they started out wearing earplugs but that didn't work cause then they couldn't hear anything else either <br> and then they
sil
tried they lowered him into a well to play and the echo when it when the sound of the flute bounced off the walls of the well it was so loud that it made the windows break uhm and then uh some doctor doctor wong or something <br> uhm made a flute specially for john's mouth so he could play and it wouldn't sound horrible
uhm and it worked so they were having a parade because the problem was solved and then all these flies came up
and john started swatting at them with his new flute and he accidentally smashed his new flute
so he took out his old flute and said like oh well
a a good thing i brought a back up so he started playing his old flute and uhm the sound was very awful but the flies hated it too so they flew away
sil
and then john would play the flute every morning like a rooster and and drive the flies away that ever came
the red leaves were blown around m in millions by the wind
sil
behind lay the ship a picture not without its lighter s lighter side

as you always say and not brushing her teeth
ps if you want if you won't have bought her a turtle it what if you wouldn't have bought her
h uhm s her a if you if you m if ps
if you would have uhm have bought her a turtle i could i couldn't have shaved it sincerely dan
uhm he had like a lot excuses uhm it was pretty funny how he shaved the cat uhm he likes to blame things on his sister a lot and uhm complain about his turtle
sil
<br>
uhm
sil
he's really trying to like uhm get out of the trouble and
sil
and
sil
he makes up a st a lot of stuff
sil
the brother hates the sister cause the sister's more responsible
sil
<br>
sil
uhm
sil
well he makes up a lot of stuff
and he's not very good at it
the red leaves were blown around in millions by the wind
sil

<unk> okay he turned h he turned his back on the boy and i already read that one
i desire it so much that i would take no refusal <unk> refusal

and the prize cup grew clear and nearer to her mental vision
sil
behind lay a ship a picture not without its lighter side without it lighter side
and meanwhile by the f future river bank came rosalind rosalind with mushrooms in her skin in her skirt
the day
sil
now go and answer your note and let me finish this splendid story
more c courage than more poor brother who stands there like a crowd
they carry themselves as if they had been drilled both men and woman
i fear what we shall have an another smart gale however it would not last long
sil
of course there's nothing very entertaining here for you
sil
these words quite destroy the hope that of late had been growling within her
its flavor when cooked is more ex excuse exquisite far than mutter or oysters or eggs
humor and path pathos <unk> pathos <unk> make it ali alive and you have found your style at last
ethel brown was seventeen years old she had a t tea party
sil
seagrave seagrave knelt <unk> by his side took his hand and burst into tears
nan said it wouldn't grow in our garden but i brought some home to try
she will be glad to see you but she said but she has been very badly frightened
he turned his back on the boy and and
sil
why did a pa oh the panda
why did a panda with the beautiful girl name yin yin have her name changed to a very un beautiful girl name columbus
uhm it was fred's idea so let's begin with fred fred fed the panda bears the tiger and turtle the tigers and turtles the turtles weren't so bad but as for the tigers he wasn't so sure he didn't mind handling the raw meat
he had to feed the to that he had to feed to the tigers his main objection was to being eaten
but the point is what he was very fond of feeding the pandas
many people know that pandas eat bamboo a lot of it a lot of bamboo can get quite heavy so be so because of the pandas freddy became very strong and was in terrific shape but physically fitness was not the only reason that freddy loved the pandas
the other reason was that yo anyone who gets within three feet of a panda actually falls in love with them it's all of nature it's a law of nature a
sil
further distance pandas have a strange have a have a
sil
yeah strange almost almost a magic effect on humans being which makes us want to hug and squeeze things fred fred was not allowed to actually hug the panda bears
mmm wait since that co since that could be dangerous so all the other people at the zoo would know what the pandas had just been fed when they saw fred hu hugging an rather un cuddly palm tree wait
wait fred hugging an rather un hug cuddling cutting wait pan trees outside of the panda's home
it is interest interesting to point out at this time that more stuffed panda bears are sold at zoo gift shops then all of the other stuff animals combined
this can almost clear certainly be accounted for by this strange almost magic effect that the pandas mo that pandas
sil
effect the pandas
sil
okay <unk> uhm pandas
sil
the pandas possess
sil
possess but everything was not all bamboo the and hugs at the zoo more one mor f one mor one morning fred was feeding yin yin and said oh yin yin i wish that more people would come to visit the zoo
i know i should be telling you this i shouldn't be telling you this but we might have to sell you to another family in the big zoo <unk> in san san ange sa wait in san
sil
angeles if we don't get more money that is not it's not yeah if you don't get more it's not that you're you really aren't selling enough stuffed panda bears
it's just that we we haven't been enough people c we haven't
sil
been there haven't been h enough people coming to see you in the first place i think what the zoo needs is a great is a
sil
advertising companion <unk> fred was starting to feel the uncomfortable urge to hug a panda bear to hug the panda bear so before he ran off to hug the palm tree quickly he said it costs so much to feed panda bears i i would hate if you had to leave us after all it's the only home you know besides if you're leaving i get i'll get terribly out of shape now if you excuse me i need to squeeze some more before i scream
but yin yin the younger panda bear was not listening to fred
she was talking to her best friend maggie the magpie magpie about going to the moon yes <unk> said one yes said the big one in the sky that that it's most like not made of cheese it's most likely not made of cheese and most certainly not made of bamboo
yin yin and her best friend mag mag friend maggie the magpie who looked a lot like a panda would look if panda would look if pandas were birds were
sil
discussing about going to the moon her mother and father knew that they were talking about talking they were talking about since they had since they h since they hadn't thought of or talked of much else since yin yin said i want to go there and pointed to the moon
enough is of the noise nonsense said yin yin's said said enough of the nonsense said yin yin's mother poo poo
what sort of nonsense is this for a young panda bear going to the moon <unk> indeed
nonsense your job is to be cute and so people want to run and g to the gift shop and buy panda bear dolls
sil
it's sis it's simple
sil
sil
spokespeople for the panda stuffed animals stuffed animal
sil
industry
which young lady helps pay for the bamboo that you eat such nonsense going to the moon said her mother poo poo
but i just learned how to i just learned how to make myself into a ball and roll into
sil
into a ball and roll two days ago if <unk> i've becoming very good at it i don't think i will it would make a long time to roll there said yin yin
yin yin's father moo man didn't think it was very
sil
very proper or wise for a young panda bear to go rolling off places where there wasn't any bamboo
he was supportive of his younger daughter and showed his support by taking a nap before he fell asleep he didn't manage to say i believe rolling is a
sil
wait
decidedly around roll roundabout way to go you must go go it t wait t'wouldn't be be best to fly wouldn't it be best to fly nonsense said mother i'm so mad i'm going to look after that lady over there and make
sil
and make her want to squeeze her son cheeks
she said spitefully an instant an an instant later a young boy was hear saying ouch momma cut that out i'm sorry said i'm sorry to say but many other little boy's cheeks have been made raw then mother poo poo was upset
<unk> yin yin <unk> was yin yin always wanted to take good advice from from her father
sil
and and less than a week uhm later yin yin and maggie had built a rocket ship out of bamboo bamboo is very workable substance said panda and pandas tend to handle bamboo a lot so i if in itself that not what astonishing at least to yin yin yin yin yin's parents fred fred sure was impressed though <unk>
the man
sil
wait the main obstacle it it runs out was getting out of wait the main
sil
obstacle it runs out was getting
sil
it turns out it was getting to the rocket ship off the ground
sil
<unk> maggie futured that if she and three of her strongest magpie friends were to each grab hold of the corner of the rocket ship they could all fly to the moon so she tried <unk>
one two three the moon they said together pulling with the mighty i see your wings flapping that we don't seem to go anywhere said yin yin hmm heavier than i thought
i think we'll need more magpies said maggie yes but how many more yin yin said i'm not sure exactly replied maggie the father wa
the father watching this all through one eye for he was always had the least one eye asleep <unk> at all times s said
sil
wait said wouldn't would be best to ask the owl then closed his eye so maggie flew to the owl and asked f a for advice oh wise owl i have a question that i fear you can answer she said how to
how how to turn your head all the way around without getting terribly pain in your neck said the owl
no how many magpie's would it take to fly around f to fly
sil
to fly four hundred pound panda bear and a one hundred pound bamboo rocket ship to the moon said maggie
the owl instantly replied two hundred thousand and seventy six or give a or give give or take two
sil
a week later maggie managed to round up two hundred thousand seventy eight magpie
sil
she could be very persuasive little bird and when she wanted
<unk> a week later despite much flapping and they're still trying to get the rocketship in the air it turns out that the owl didn't take into consideration that once you get over to the <unk> over one thousand magpie together they tend to fly and can't agree on a single thing <unk>
sil
now while all this was going on do you supposed fred was doing he was fe he was feeding the pandas like he was supposed to
sil
so one day after fred had fed the pandas and was hugging the panda tree palm tree the zoo manager came up to him and said what is going on with yo with your pandas fred i've never seen anything like it
oh well that makes sense then said the manager did you know that since the little panda built the bamboo rocket ship those magpie's started fluttering about the zoo's
sil
wait magpie's started fluttering around that the zoo's profits had gone up to four thousand percent
<br>
this is just the type of experience <unk> wait ex this is just the type of
sil
experience we need those pandas will be with us for a long time fred thought about it and said you know i think we should rename yin yin col
columbus the zoo keeper said good heavens that name is a great idea no wait a second i don't understand well sir when columbus set out on his ship
he was re he was really try trying to find a quicker way to get to get to a a quicker way to get to get around
<br>
europe to get around europe europe in order to improve trade
improve trade
<br>
he wanted to be a qui he wanted to find a quicker way wait he wanted to be a business man by but instead became a great explorer
yes but what does that have to do with the panda's name said the zoo manager well it seems to me sir that yin yin wanted to be a great explorer instead became a business woman
i see fred th one more thing sir about those magpies flying the pandas do you think the zoo could purchase a me a large sized umbrella
the f wait umbrella the zoo manager laughed he walked away but didn't purchase a flash a fashionable but did purchase a fashion fashionable yellow umbrella for fred the next day
back back in the panda's home the mother pan mother panda poo poo <unk> was very proud of her daughter after all if if it weren't for yi for yin yin they wouldn't have wouldn't have to move from their wonderful home
but later fred walked into the panda panda's home under under his new ye yellow umbrella he could could think to say nonsense wait he couldn't
as for yin yin he was very proud of her an to be renamed for a famous explorer and she and maggie never stopped trying to get to the moon
uhm well i learned about the panda and
sil
sil
uhm <br> <unk>
sil
that bamboo that pandas are good with uhm bamboo and they can make stuff out of it and
sil
uhm
sil
that's about all well it's about a panda and a zookeeper named him named her columbus because she wanted to go to the moon so she built a rocketship and wanted to have magpies fly her all the way up there and colombus was an explorer
<br> and sh that was like her and she became like a business woman and colombus became a business man and the panda's were going to get s uhm taken to another zoo if they didn't get more people and more people came and the panda built and that's about all
sil
well because like she got so many people to come and look a
uhm well there's a f father and mother and a daughter <br> the daughter's name is uhm yin yin
the mom's name is poo po and the dad's name is
sil
uhm
sil
well i'm not i forgot what his is and <br> well they might they might get sold to another zoo
their family or yin yin might and
and they think what yin yin's doing's nonsense and they don't think it's good for her to do that and for her to be like going going places where there's no bamboo and
<br>
but i am too old to endure your shame and misery much longer

sil
the first time i ever took an airplane by myself it was fun and scary
i didn't know anyone at all and i had to go all the way from new york to texas without my parents
i was flying there to see my grandfather and we were going to go fishing
i've always thought flying was fun you go higher th than any mountain and go faster than any car
but to tell you the t but to tell the truth without my parents there i was pretty nervous
i guess it was because the plane was so loud and i didn't know anyone
i started thinking we might crash i didn't like to think about that but i couldn't help it
<unk> that's when that's when i missed the p my parents the most
but once the plane was in the air i was pretty good
<unk> my mom gave me a coloring book a of cool looking dragon to keep me busy
i colored the dragon pictures all green so it didn't take very long
i col the o i only used the green crayon because it was the tallest and i wanted it to catch up t to the red blue yellow and purple and black ones
<unk> one thing about being by yourself on an airplane is that the flight attendants are very nice to you
i had seven colas and four ginger ales which made me had to go to the bathroom eight times <unk>
i was glad that there wasn't anybody next to me
<unk> the person next to me would have been very annoyed <unk>
<unk> eventually the flight attendant seemed to go get a little annoyed that i had to go to the bathroom so much
but it was her fault she was the one who kept trying to give me peanuts
i told her that i wanted a banana split instead she instead but she said we don't have banana splits on a plane
it was the peanuts that were making me so thirsty in the first place
so that if she would get me a ba so if she wouldn't banana split i wouldn't have to go the bathroom so much
or if she would get me a banana split i wouldn't have to go the bathroom so much
she told me to be quiet and watch the movie
<unk> i i tried to watch the movie but i had already seen
sil
that one was so b i had already seen that one so it was boring
the flight attendant gave me a deck of cards but she wouldn't play go fish with me
she said that she had to help other passengers <unk>
i had a game boy in my backpack my backpack was the o was in the overhead thingy
i tried to push the button that lights up i tried to push the button that lights over up over my head so the flight attendant would come
but guess what i was too short to s uhm reach the button
so i started yelling hey peanut lady hey peanut lady
she didn't like called be she didn't like being called peanut lady but she did get my game boy
<br> she told me to call her jennifer instead
i played on my game boy until i got to new until i got a new high score then jennifer came then j jennifer came up to me and said she was she had a surprise
i thought great more peanuts
but it wasn't peanuts it was something really cool
she said the captain was inviting me to the cockpit
<unk> i thought awesome he also i also brought my deck of cards in case the pilot was bored and wanted to play go fish
<br> jennifer took me to the cockpit and there was where there was a million buttons and levers and knobs and stuff
at first i thought wow look at all those buttons then i thought
there's no way i a there's no way anyone can remember to push all those buttons at the rights time we are going to crash
<unk> the w that way i figured it out
<unk> that's the way i figured it my my game my game boy only has five buttons and i can't g b get past level three
imagine how hard it would to be work those millions of buttons and eat peanuts
<unk> the pilot told me there that he wasn't really that it wasn't really that hard once you practiced
then he told me that he once played a game boy
sil
that he once played the game i had on my game boy but he couldn't even pass level one
i said if you can't get even past level one then and you're a pilot then i could be a pilot too since i'm much better at pushing buttons than you are
he laughed even though it wasn't joking joking
he said that i would make a uhm very good pilot someday if i wanted to be
he was really nice but he but he wouldn't play go fish with me
finally we landed <unk> that was scary
it seems like the plane was going so fast to ever stop but it seems like the planes going too fast to ever stop but it does
<br> when i get off the airplane there was grandpa waiting for me he said
how was your flight i said someday i'm going to be a pilot and i'm only serve banana splits on my plane
grandpa laughed and took me straight to the ice cream shop
it was worth the whole trip just to eat a banana split with grandpa
a little kid is on this airplane and without his parents <br> and he's he's the first time he it's the first time he it's the first time he's done it he has done it <unk> uhm and he
sil
really short he's really short
so <br>
sil
and then he doesn't understand how to fly a plane so he thinks that he can fly a plane because he can play game boy and stuff
and he meets uh jennifer the stewardess
sil
not really <br> oh yeah jennifer's obsessed with giving him peanuts
<br>
how should i know
sil
<br>
<br>
i don't know
sil
<br>
sil
peoples think i am
sil
<br>
sil
uhm
sil
uhm he meets a lady named jennifer who g who is obsessed with giving him peanuts and then she gives him a deck of cards
sil
and but she won't play with go fish with him <br> but then later she invites him to the cockpit
and
<br>
he thinks that uhm he can drive the plane because he's good at pushing buttons on his game boy
and he thinks he'd be a much better pilot then the pilot that's actually piloting the plane
and but the pilot also won't play go fish with him
sil
he turned his back on the boy and conferred <unk> conferred aside with lawrence
sil
i desire it so much that i would take no refusal
sil
and the prize cup grew cl clearer and nearer to her mental vision
sil
behind lay the ship a picture not without its lighter side
sil
and meanwhile by the further river bank came rosalind with mushrooms in her skirt

she will be glad to see you but she has b been very b badly frightened
sil
dear mom and dad
since you have grounded me and told me to write down why i am sorry before i was allowed out of my room i am mad at you
i would like to start by saying that i think that you are very mean to make me do this because it wasn't even my fault
i couldn't help it anyway it was an accident and i didn't even do it on purpose
i really didn't mean to s shave that the cat really i swear
ok here's what happened as i remember it
i saw the cat was trying to get to get the gerbils and you told us we couldn't hit animals so i didn't
i didn't know what else to do so i grabbed dad's nose hair c clippers and shaved it
you should be proud of me for thinking so fast on my toes
oh sure it's easy to say that i should have just picked up the cat but sometimes we don't always think all that great under pressure
and you know what <unk> those stupid gerbils didn't even thank me
they just ra ran on in the stupid wheel and did stupid things
that's the last time i shave the cat to protect any stupid gerbils
i just didn't want to see the cat getting all hot and uncomfortable and stuff
you guys will just probably say it's winter danny <unk> cats don't overheat in winter
but so what if it's winter
i mean it's be su it'll be summer soon enough and i just wanted the cat to get s get used to the idea before it really got hot
plus oscar plus oscar my turtle told me to shave the cat
<unk> fi fine oscar can't really talk but if he could he would have said
please shave the cat it keeps hitting on my shell and trying to roll me over when when you leave the room
you guys never liked oscar as much as the cat anyway
you wouldn't always take the cat's si you would al you wouldn't always take the cat's side if you knew the stuff he did to poor turtle to my poor turtle
cat's aren't always nice just like my sister jenny isn't always nice
but the real reason i shaved the cat was to make a wig for those poor hair less cats
sil
that we see on tv on the animal ch channel
<unk> i knew our cat would grow her fur back but some cats don't have hair
they are called hairless cats and <unk> and they need fur in the winter sometimes i think i swear that's the reason
also i am going to sell the cat fur and buy my sister jenny braces for her big stupid face
plus i i forgot to tell you that
sil
that you should be blaming ms casper my science teacher she made made us shave something for science
ask her she said that sh that when we shave hair it grows back harder sometimes even darker
so i thought that if i could shave the cat a lot of a bunch of times
he her hair would grow back harder each time and soon she would have an invincible coat of cat fur armor
then she would be a super cat and you could take her on tv shows and get lots of money so that you can buy jenny's college
even if she is dumb little tattle'tale
she's s she's so good at school and you brought me she
sil
you bought mean she's really her cat it cause she's so responsible and stu and stuff
just cause she's a good student doesn't mean she's really responsible
last night i saw that she didn't brush her teeth oh yeah i forgot to tell you that
<unk> dear mom and dad jenny didn't brush her teeth last night i think that you should
sil
i think that she should brush her teeth twice tonight
that's just my opinion though
i'll bet you didn't know something else
did you know that i wanted to be a barber
i was afraid to tell you the real reason i shaved the cat was that because i want to be a barber and i needed practice
i was
sil
afraid that you wouldn't let me practice on my own head
i can practice by shaving jenny's head
i'll promise that i'll do better job then i did on the cat because now i have what dad calls life experience
not that i shaved the cat though
actually the truth is th that by a i i i by accident turned on the nose hair clip clip clippers
and the cat was being chased by the turtle and ran right by the clippers and shaved herself
i kept saying no kitty no don't shave yourself
but my stupid sister never taught her cat how to listen so she just ignored me
see she's not responsible after all
if i had a cat i know that you should teach a cat to shave itself
<unk> plus if you weren't always cuddling with my sister so much maybe you would have been with the with her cat
instead the the cat came into my room because jenny never plays with it li
sil
enough
the cat liked being shaved anyway so i didn't see the big deal
i think it really likes the its haircut
the only reason it it hasn't come out f for two weeks is because you guys made such a big deal out of it poor kitty and that a this and poor kitty that
it's your fault really
<unk>
dad please don't read the next part
dear mom don't let dad know the real reason i shaved the cat was because always sneezing around it
i i know how much you hate him always sneezing and so i thought if i got rid of the fur he wouldn't sneeze
and <unk> and that you would have a better marriage
sil
<unk> so it really was my father's day gift to him
i couldn't buy him any anything nice since you took away m my allowance for shaving the neighbor's dog
how come jenny gets a cat and i get a stupid turtle anyway
turtles don't have do anything except poke their heads out and not be cuddly
can i get a dog please
so in my conclusion
i'm getting hungry and i'm sorry for shaving the cat although you can see that it's really jenny's fault for not being the responsible as you always say and not brushing her teeth
ps if you would have brought brought her bought her a turtle i couldn't have shaved it
sincerely danny
sil
<unk> the story was about this guy named danny and he shaved hi his sisters cat
and he in the in the letter to his parents he was saying all these reasons but i don't think they were really true i think he just did it for fun
<unk> and it do and he just kept naming the reasons
and so that he would get in trouble
sil
and that's what i think
sil
uh some of the excuses were he <unk> wanted didn't want her mom to sneeze anymore because of the cat fur and that the cat always flipped over the turtles shell
and his sister wasn't responsible to have one so if she didn't have one she he wouldn't have shaved it and
<unk> that he was just trying to get out of it so that's some of it

now all the people rejoiced because the wicked king should rule them no longer
sil
<unk> rooster john
before i tell you about h how rooster john got his name you should know a little bit about the town of franksville
franksville is a town that seemed to have one problem after the other
their problems started when they ran out of water
thankfully someone was digging a hole and found water
but soon after they
sil
after that s they started to get flies
they got tons and tons of flies
sil
the flies stopped just a bit and then a man moved into town who played a f who played the flute so badly that people would run away screaming
<br> maybe <unk> a poorly <unk> maybe a poorly played flute doesn't sound all that bad
<br> but just try to imagine someone scratching a chalkboard with a fork and then multiply that times a hundred
that's how the flute sounded when the guy played it i'm serious
still that's not that's not as bad as million flies of flies millions of flies i suppose
the bad the bad flute player was rooster john
he wasn't called rooster john yet but that came later
he was the new town dentist
he was an excellent dentist but his real love was music
he played many musical instruments such as the guitar the tuba the piano and the clarinet
however for some reason the way his mouth was shaped the m made his flute sound awful
sil
<br> we can't let you play the flute anymore john said police chief sanders
the neighbors are complaining and the cats and dogs are trying to chew off their ears
<br> but i have to play i was born to do it i don't know why but i feel like i have to or else bad things will happen
look john i've heard you play the clarinet you're quite good why don't you play that instead said chief sanders
sil
oh that's a that's a nice instrument but it's not the flute i even wrote you a song chief sanders it's called cops and robbers
he played the song the police chief hated the sound so much that he threw john in jail
<unk> but they couldn't keep john in jail since he really since he wasn't really breaking any laws
there was nothing the police could do
besides everybody loved john
since he had become the town dentist everyone's teeth were much whiter and cleaner no one had any cavities
so there was no problem in a little in the little town of franksville
what should they do they couldn't keep john in jail and they didn't want to to kick him out of town because they all had such nice t nice teeth
so they decided that john could play the flute and everybody else would have to wear earplugs
since i'm sure you guessed that didn't work
sil
no one could hear anything people were getting into car accidents
sil
<unk> and everybody looked really silly at dances dancing to music they couldn't hear
they r they couldn't they couldn't they just couldn't lead a normal life
and they decided to lower him down a well and let him play there <unk> where no one down there where no one c down where no one could hear him
john thought that it was an ok idea but there was an echo in the well that made the flute sound louder
windows were breaking and all the cows in town started to make sour milk
the local dentist doctor scientist doctor wong came up with an idea
he thought that if uhm
<unk>
he thought that if he made a new mouthpiece especially shaped for john's mouth then perhaps he could play the flute normally
and guess what what it worked
doctor wong was the town hero the flute sounded normal and turned out john could play it quite well
<unk> the people in the town decided to have a great big parade in franksville to celebrate the fact for once that there was no water problem no fly problem and no flute problem
doctor wong and john were the stars of the parade
they even w were up on the main float
a big band played as they marched up and down main street everyone cheered
<unk> then suddenly a fly landed on the little girl then the fly landed on someone else then some landed on a bunch of people
pretty soon tons of flies were landing on everyone
but before they knew it <unk> the town was filled with flies again
oh no said chief sanders when things were just going good for franksville
john didn't know what what just kept to do so he just kept on playing his flute
the flies were annoying so he would swat at them with his hand or even his new flute
he started shaking the flute to get the flies off and accidentally s smashed it into pieces
he was very upset at first then he said oh well good thing i brought my old flute as a back up
no no please don't play your old flute begged doctor wong but it was too late
john had started playing
when the townsfolk heard the noise they couldn't even swat the flies anymore
they had to cover their ears from the horrible sound
the flies would land all over the people and they couldn't swat them off
it was gross then suddenly the flies flew away fast as they could
sil
doctor wong thought f thought for a second and then pronounced
it's the flute sound the flies hate john's flute playing and as much as we do
john the dentist is driving the flies away
then it was the then the people of franksville realized that they would have to take the good with the bad
<br> from then on john would wake up at sunrise just like a rooster to play to play to keep the flies away
sil
rooster john is a story about a town that gets into problem after problem and they get a big fly problem and john uh rooster john starts uhm he plays the flute and uhm all the flies go away
and s and if h he has his and then someone invents him another flute that doesn't make a horrible sound like his other flute did cause his other flute made a really horrible sound that the townspeople couldn't like stand
and so but the good sound of the flute like made the flies all come back and so he the town just had to live with like what rooster john played and so
he would like wake up every morning and like play his flute uhm like a rooster uhm would like crow at the beginning of the day

the airplane ride
the first time i ever took an airplane by myself was fun and scary
i didn't know anyone all the all that had to go the way from new york to texas without my parents i was flying there to see my grandfather and we were going to go fishing
i've always thought flying was fun you go h you you go higher than any mountain go faster than any car
sil
but to tell the truth without my parents there i was pretty nervous i guess it was because the plane was so loud and i didn't know anyone
i started thinking that we might crash i didn't like to think about that but i couldn't help it
that's when i missed my parents the most but once a plane was in the air i felt pretty good
it was pretty good my mom gave me a coloring book of cool looking dragons to keep me busy i colored the dragon pictures all green so it didn't take very long
sil
i only used the green crayon because it was the tallest and i wanted to catch up with the red brown blue yellow purple and black ones
sil
one night the paper clip fell off
sil
it's right here
sil
one thing about being by yourself on airplanes is that the flight attendants are very nice to you
i had seven cola's and four ginger ale's which made me had to go to the bathroom eight times
i i was glad that there wasn't anyone next to me the person next to me would have would have been been very annoyed
eventually the flight attendant seemed to get a little annoyed that i had to go to the bathroom so much
but it was her fault she was the one that kept trying to give me peanuts
sil
i told her that i wanted a banana split instead but she said there they have they don't have any banana splits on this plane
sil
in the first place and that if she would give me a banana split i wouldn't have to go the bathroom so much
she told me to be quiet and watch the movie i tried to watch the movie but i had already seen it seen that so it was boring the flight attendant gave me a deck of cards but she wouldn't play go fish with me she said
sil
she had to help other passengers
sil
i had my gameboy in my back i had a game boy in my backpack my backpack was o in the overhead thingy i tried to push the bottom lights over so the flight attendant would come would
<br>
lights over so my flight attendant would come but guess what she was she was too short to reach the bottom
so i started yelling hey peanut lady peanut lady she didn't like me calling her peanut lady but she did get m me my game boy
she told me to call her jennifer instead
sil
i played on my game boy until i got the new high score then jennifer came up to me and said
sil
had a surprise i thought th i great i thought more peanuts
but it wasn't the peanuts she was s she said something really cool she said that the captain was inviting me to see the cockpit
although i i thought awesome i also brought a d deck of cards in case the pilot was bored and wanted to play go fish
jennifer took me to the cockpit and there was one million buttons
sil
<unk>
the way i figured out my game my game boy was only five buttons and i can't get past the th the past the l i can't get past level three imagine how hard it'd be to work all those millions of buttons and eat peanuts
the pilot told me that there wasn't
sil
that it wasn't really that hard once you
sil
practiced then then he told me that the once the once that once he played game ga the game i had on my game boy and he couldn't even pass level one
i said if you can't even get past level one and you're a pilot then could then i could be a pilot too since i'm much better at pushing buttons than you are
he laughed even though i'm was wasn't joking he said he thought i would make a really great pilot someday if i wanted to be he was really nice but he wouldn't play go fish with me
finally we landed
sil
finally we landed landed
sil
that's always scary it seems like the plane is going too fast to ever stop but it does
sil
when i got off the airplane there was my
sil
there was grandpa waiting for me he said how was your flight i said someday i'm going to be a pilot and i'm only going to serve banana splits on my plane
grandpa laughed and took us straight and took me straight to ice cream shop
it was worth the whole trip just to eat b a banana split with grandpa
it's about this kid that's never been on an airplane ride before and he flew from new york to texas to see his grandpa
to go fishing and on the trip he uh drank six colas and four ginger ales and he had to go to the bathroom eight times and
the flight attendant got a little annoyed so she gave him a pack of c a deck of cards
to play and the guy got mad cause he she wouldn't want to play to go fish
and she kept on trying to serve him peanuts and he said that the peanuts needed to make him go to the bathroom so bad in the first place so
eventually she got pretty annoyed and told him that he should s she said that she had a special surprise for him which was he could see the c in the cockpit to go to see the pilot and
sil
oh yeah and like he n wanted his game boy before and he
got the game boy and got to level f got the high score and got to level three and so he saw the co the pilot and he realized that with all those buttons and
and uhm buttons and all that other levers and stuff he wouldn't be able to press all those buttons at one time
and he said that <unk> his game boy only has five buttons and he can get only to the third level
so the pilot played the game boy and said that and he only got to the first level
and that then he thought that he could be a pilot cause he could get to the third level and then he landed and his grandpa took him to the ice cream shop

sil
dear mom and dad parents
since you have grounded me and told me to write down why i'm i am sorry before i was allowed out of my room i am mad at you
i would like to start by saying that i think you are very mean to make me do this because it wasn't even my fault i couldn't help it anyway it was an accident and i didn't even do it on purpose
i really didn't mean to shave that cat shave the cat really i swear ok here's what happened as i remember it
i saw the cat was trying i saw that the cat was trying to get the gerbils so you and you told us we couldn't hit the animals so i wouldn't didn't know what else to do
so i grabbed dad grabbed dad's nose hairs clippers and shaved it
you you you should be proud of me for thinking sometimes why we shouldn't always think that all that that that think all that great under pressure
and do you know what those stupid gerbils didn't even thank me they just ran on that stupid wheel and did stupid things that's that's the last time i shave the cat to protect my any stupid gerbils
besides the real reason i i shaved the cat was to keep it nice and cool i didn't want the t to see the cat getting all hot and uncomfortable and stuff
you guys will probably just say it's winter danny cats don't overheat in the winter
a and so what if it's winter but <unk> i mean i mean it'll be summer soon enough soon enough and i'll and i just wanted the cat to get used to the idea before it got really hot plus oscar my turtle told me to shave the cat
fine oscar can't really talk but if he could he would have said please shave the cat it keeps hitting me on the shell and trying to roll me over when you leave me in when you leave the room you guys never liked oscar as much as the cat anyway
you wouldn't you wouldn't always take the cat cat's side if you knew the stuff he did to my poor turtle cat's aren't always nice it just just like my sister jenny isn't always nice
the realest reason i shaved the cat was to make a big wing a wing for the those poor hair less cats that we saw on tv on the animal channel
i i knew our cat would grow her fur back but some cats don't have hair they're called hairless cats they need fur in the winter sometimes i think
i swear that's the reason also i was g going to sell the cat the cat fur and buy my sister jenny braces for her f big stupid face
plus i forgot to tell you that you should be blaming mrs casper my science teacher she made us shave something for science ask her she said that when we shave hair it grows back harder and sometimes even darker
so i thought if i would sh should could shave the cat a lot a lot a bunch of times her hair would grow back harder each time and she would soon she would be an invincible coat of cat fur armor
then she would be a super cat and you could tell and you could take her on tv shows and get lots of money so that you can send jenny her cat because she's so responsible and stuff
just cause she's a good student doesn't mean she's really responsible
j last night i saw she didn't even brush her teeth oh yeah i forgot to tell you that
dear mom and dad jenny didn't brush her teeth last night
i think sh that she should brush her teeth twice tonight that's my opinion though i th i bet you didn't know something else did did you know that i wanted to be a barber
i was afraid to tell you the real the real reason i shaved the cat was that i want to be a barber and i needed practice
it was af i was afraid you wouldn't let me practice on my own head can i practice sha by shaving jenny's head
i promise i'll that i'll do a better job then i did on the cat because now i ha now i have what dad calls life experience that's not that's n that's not i shaved the cat though
actually the truth is that i by accident turned on the nose hair clippers and the cat was being chased by the turtle and ran right by the clippers and shaved herself
i kept saying no kitty don't no don't shave yourself but the st my stupid sister never taught her cat how to listen so she just ignored me
see she's not responsible after all if i had a cat i would teach it to to not to not shave itself that's for sure
i i know i i did i don't have to get good grades to know what you should teach a cat to shave itself
plus if you weren't always cuddling with my sister so much maybe she would have been she would have been with her cat instead the cat came into my room because jenny never plays with it enough
the cat liked being shaved anyway so i don't see the big deal i i think it really likes its haircut the only reason it hasn't come out for two weeks is because you guys made such a big deal about it
poor kitty this is this and poor kitty that it's your fault really dad please don't read the next part
dear mom don't let dad know the real reason i shaved the cat he's always sneezing around it
i know how much you hate him always sneezing and stuff so i thought if i get rid of its fur he wouldn't sneeze and that you would have a better marriage so that's really why my father's day gift to him
i couldn't i couldn't buy him anything nice since you took away my allowance for when i shaved the neighbor's dog
how come jenny gets a cat and i get a stupid turtle anyway turtles don't do anything except for poke their heads out and not be cuddly
can i get a dog please so in conclusion i'm getting hungry and i'm sorry for shaving the cat although you can see that it's really jenny's fault for not being responsible as you can say as you can always say and not brushing her teeth
ps if you really if you could have bought her a turtle i wouldn't shaved it sin sincerely danny
it's about a person tell apologizing to his mom and dad because he shaved the cat and he really tried to make
he really wanted the dad to not be allergic to the cat because that's his father's day gift
sil
<br>
uhm well this letter is about
a kid trying to make up excuses by saying that like the cat shaved itself and he got a stupid turtle and he wanted the cat to feel nicer because it he wanted it to be cool and not be hot all the time
and and then he actually told his mom that his dad was like allergic to cats
and he wanted him to feel better because he didn't want him sneezing all the time
and it that was his father's day gift to him cause he his allowance was took tooken away

rooster john
sil
before i tell you how rooster john got his name you should know a little bit about the town of franksville
f franksville is was a town that seemed to have one problem after another
sil
their problems started when they ran out of water thankfully someone was digging a hole and found water
but soon after they started to get fleas they got tons and tons of fleas flies and
sil
then the flies stopped <unk>
but just then a ma a man moved in town who played the flute so badly that people would run away screaming
sil
maybe a poorly played flute doesn't sound that bad but just try to imagine some scratching someone scratching on a chalkboard with a fork
sil
and then multiply that times by that times a hundred that's how the flute sounded when this guy played it i'm serious
sil
still it's not as bad as millions of f flies i suppose
the bad flute player was rooster john
sil
he wasn't called rooster john he wasn't called rooster john yet that came later
sil
he was
sil
the new town dentist
sil
he was an excellent dentist
sil
but his real love was music
he played many musical instruments such as the guitar the tuba the piano and the clarinet however for some reasons the way his mouth was shaped made his flute sound awful
sil
we can't let you play the flute anymore john said the police chief said police chief s sanders the neighbors are complaining that the cats and dogs are trying to chew off their ears
sil
but i have i have to play i was born to do it i don't know why but i feel like i have to or else bad things will happen
look john
sil
i've heard you play the clarinet you're quite good why don't you play that instead ch said chief sanders
sil
oh that's a nice instrument but it's just not the flute
sil
i even wrote a song chief sanders it's called cops and robbers
sil
then he played the song the police chief hated the sound so much he threw john in jail
sil
but they couldn't keep john in jail since he wasn't wasn't really breaking any laws so there was nothing the police could do
besides everybody loved john since he had become the town dentist everybody's teeth so were much whiter and
sil
cl cleaner and no one had any cavities
sil
so there was a problem
sil
in the little town of franksville what should they do they couldn't keep john in jail and they didn't want to kick him out of the town because all
sil
cause they all had such nice teeth so they decided that john could play the flute and everybody else would wear would have to wear earplugs
well i'm sure you guessed that didn't work no one could hear anything people were getting into car accidents and
sil
oh no said
sil
and everybody looked really silly at dances
sil
dancing to music they couldn't hear
sil
they just couldn't lead a normal life
sil
then they decided to lower him down
sil
as we
sil
a well and let him play down where no one could hear him
john thought it was an ok idea
but there was an echo in the well that made the flute sound louder
sil
windows were breaking and all the cows in the town started to make sour milk
sil
the local scientist doc doctor wong came up with an idea he thought that if he made a new mouthpiece especially shaped for john's mouth then perhaps he could play the flute normally
sil
and guess what
sil
it worked doctor john was a town hero doctor wong was the town hero
the flute sounded normal and it turned out john could play quite well
the people in the town decided to have a great big parade in franksville to celebrate the fact
sil
that for once there was no water problem no fly problem and no flute problem doctor wong and john were star were the stars of the parade
sil
they were up on the main float the big band played as they marched down the s d up and down main street
everyone cheered
sil
then suddenly a fly landed on a little girl then the fly landed on someone else
then some some landed on a bunch of people pretty soon there were tons of flies
sil
tons of flies were landing on everyone before they knew it the town was filled with flies again
sil
oh no said chief sanders just when things were going good in franksville
sil
john didn't know what to do so he kept playing his flute the flies were annoying so he wouldn't so he would swat at them with his hands
sil
or even his new flute he started shaking the flute to get the flies off the
sil
and accidentally smashed it into pieces
sil
it was very upset he was very upset at first then he said oh well good thing i brought my old flute as back up
no no please don't play your old flute big begged doctor wong but it was too late john had started playing
when the townsfolk heard the noise they couldn't even swat at the flies anymore
sil
they had to cover their ears from the horrible sound the flies would land all over the people and they couldn't swat them off it was gross then suddenly the flies flew away fast as they could
sil
doctor wong thought for for a second then pronounced
sil
it's the flute sound the flies hate john's flute playing as much as we do john the dentist drives away
sil
the flies away
it was
sil
then that the people of franksville ville realized that they would have to take a good
sil
take the good with the bad because as bad as the sou as
sil
bad as the flute sounded it was a lot better than thousands of flies crawling on them
sil
from then on john would wake up at sunrise like a rooster and play to keep the flies away
well it was about this guy who couldn't play the flute very well but he was a really good dentist
so
sil
he so he played the flute to keep the flies away from the little town franksville
sil
and it worked and the reason they called him rooster john was because he woke up really early and started playing his flute really badly
sil
and it woke everybody up
sil
he
sil
he
sil
<br>
sil
he played his flute so much that it kept the flies away and the flies
sil
flies stayed away but the people didn't know that until
sil
john had started playing his
sil
old flute
sil
and then once he started playing his old flute all the flies went away and doctor wong thought that it might be the flute that was driving the flies away because the flies didn't come back when he was playing his old and bad flute

sil
the panda
why did a panda with the beautiful girl name yin yin have her name changed to the very un beautiful girl name columbus
it was fred's idea so let's begin with fred fred fed the panda bears the tigers and turtles the turtles weren't so bad but as for the tigers he wasn't so sure
he didn't mind handling the raw meat he had to feed to the tigers his main objection was to being eaten
no one could blame fred really since no one really wants to be eaten
some people do like to bite their finger nails but fred wasn't a nail biter so being eaten was definitely not something he looked forward to each afternoon at three o'clock when it was time to feed the tigers
for fred when it came to the pandas he had a warm spot in his heart actually feeding the pandas wait uh actually it was eighty five point degree spot on his left kidney but the point is that he was very fond of feeding the pandas
there were three pandas and they were known as the pan family they were in order of cuteness yin yin the young daughter poo poo the mother and moo man the gentle and always sleepy father
many people know that pandas eat bamboo a lot of it a lot of bamboo can get can get quite heavy so because of the pandas fred became very strong and was in terrific shape
but physical fitness was not the only reason that fred loved the pandas the other reason was that anyone who gets within three feet of a panda automatically falls in love with them
it was a law of nature in further distances pandas have a strange almost magical effect on human beings which makes us want to hug and squeeze things
fred was not allowed to actually hug the panda bears since that he could be dangerous so all the other people at the zoo would know that the pandas had just been fed when they saw fred hugging the rather un cuddly palm tree outside of the panda's home
it is interesting to point out at this time that more s stuffed panda bears are sold at zoo gift shops then all of the other stuff animals combined
this can almost certainly be accounted for by this strange almost magical effect that the pandas possess
but everything was not all bamboo and hugs at the zoo
one morning fred was feeding yin yin and said oh yin yin i wish that more people would come to visit the zoo
i know i shouldn't be telling you this but we might have to sell you and your family to the big zoo in san angeles if we don't get more money
it's not that you aren't selling enough stuffed panda bears it's just that there haven't been enough people coming to see you in the first place i think what zoos needs is a great advertising campaign
fred was starting to feel the uncontrollable urge to hug the panda so before he ran off to hug the palm tree quickly
said it costs so much to feed your pa panda bears i would hate if you had to leave us after all it's only the home you know
sil
besides if you leave i'll get terribly out of shape now if you excuse me i need to squeeze something before i can scream but yin yin and the young panda was not listening to fred
fred she was talking to her best friend maggie the magpie about going to the moon yes the big one in the sky that is most likely not made of cheese and most certainly not made of bamboo
yin yin and her best friend maggie the magpie who looked a lot like a panda would look if pandas were birds were discussing about going to the moon
her mother and father knew what they were talking about since they hadn't thought or talked much of of else since yin yin said i want to go there and pointed to the moon
enough of this nonsense said yin yin's mother poo poo what sort of nonsense is this for a young panda bear
going to the moon indeed nonsense your job is to be cute so people want to run off to the gift shop and to buy panda bear dolls
it's simple economics like like it we're not we are spokespeople for the panda stuffed animal industry which young lady helps pay for the bamboo b that you eat such nonsense going to the moon said her mother poo poo
but i just learned how to make myself into a ball and roll two days ago and i've becoming very good at it i don't think it will take that long to roll there said yin yin
yin yin's father moo man didn't think it was very proper or wise for a young panda bear to go rolling off to places where there wasn't any bamboo but she was supportive of his young daughter and showed his support by taking a nap
but after he fell asleep he did manage to say i believe rolling is a decidedly round about way to go if you must go it it it t'would be the best to fly
nonsense said the mother i'm so mad i'm going to look at that lady over there and make her want to squeeze her son cheeks he said spitefully an instant later a young boy was heard saying ouch mom cut that out i'm sorry to say but many a little boy's cheeks have been made raw when mother poo poo panda was upset
yin yin was always one to take good advice from her father and less than a week later yin yin and maggie had built a rocket ship out of bamboo bamboo is very workable substance and pandas tend to handle bamboo a lot so that so that this in itself was not that astonishing at least to the yin yins parents fred sure was impressed though
one two three to the moon they all they said together pulling with all their might i see your wings flapping but we don't seem to be going anywhere said yin yin
hmm heavier than i thought i think we will need more magpies said maggie yes but how many more yin yin said i'm not sure exactly replied maggie
the father watching this all through one eye for he always had at least one eye asleep at all times said t'would be the best to ask the owl then closed his eye
so maggie flew to the owl and asked for his advice oh wise owl i have a question that i fear only you can answer she said
how to turn your head all the way around with getting a terrible pain in your neck said owl
the owl instantly replied two hundred thousand and seventy six give or take two a week later maggie managed to round up two hundred thousand and seventy eight magpies she could be a very persuasive little bird when she wanted
a week later despite much flapping they were still trying and to get the rocket in the air it turns out that the owl didn't take into consideration that once you get over one thousand magpie together they tend to fight and can't agree on a single thing
<br> now while all this was going on what do you supposed fred was doing
while why he was feeding the pandas like he was supposed to so one day after so one day after fred had fed the pandas and was hugging the palm tree the zoo manager came up to him and said what is going on with your pandas with your pandas fred i've never seen anything like it
it's taken me a couple of weeks to figure it out but i think yin yin wants to go to the moon and magpies want to take her said fred
oh well that makes sense then said the manager did you know that since the little panda built that bamboo rocket ship and those magpie's started fluttering about that the zoo's profits have gone up four gone up four thousand percent this is just the type of exposure we needed those pandas will be with us for a long time
fred thought about it and said you know i think we should rename yin yin columbus the zoo keeper said good heavens man that is a great idea no wait a second i don't understand well sir
<br> when when columbus set out on his ship he was really trying to find a quicker way to get to get to get around europe in order to improve trade he wanted to be a business man but instead became a great explorer
yes but what does that have to do with the pandas man said the zoo pe zoo keeper well it seems to me sir that yin yin wanted to be a great explorer and instead became a business woman
i see fred one more one more thing sir about those magpies flying above the pandas do you think that the zoo could purchase me a large sized umbrella
the zoo manager laughed and walked away but did purchase a fashionable yellow umbrella for fred the next day
back in the panda's home the mother panda poo poo was very proud of her daughter after all if it weren't for yin yin they would have to move th they would have they would have had to move their wonderful home but later when fred walked into the panda's home under his new yellow umbrella all she could think to say was nonsense
as for yin yin she was very proud to be renamed after a famous explorer and she and maggie never stopped trying to get to the moon
well it was about a panda named yin yin that w wanted to get to the moon really bad and
friend maggie the magpie gathered all these magpies to h to help her fly the rocketship to the moon cause the panda was too heavy
and her mother thought it was nonsense but h nonsense but her father was supportive
and fred renamed yin yin colombus because he thought that yin yin was trying to be a great explorer of the moon
sil
fred was the guy that fed all the pandas and he really liked the pandas a lot and he didn't want to have them move away because the zoo ratings were low
<br>
well the zoo ratings up went up really high because all the people liked seeing like the rocketship with magpies and everything

seagrave knelt by his side took his hand and burst into tears
nan said it wouldn't grow in our garden but i brought some home to try
his boots creaked too so loudly but still he was not afraid at all er not at all afraid
she will be glad to see you but she has been very badly frightened
i desire it so much that i will take no refusal
and the prize cup grew clearer and and nearer to her mental vision
behind her lay the ship a picture not without its lighter side
sil
the first time i ever took an airplane by myself it was a fun and scary
i didn't know anyone at all and had to go all the way from new york to texas without my parents i was flying there to see my grandfather and we were going to go fishing
i've always thought flying was fun you go higher than any mountain and you go faster than any car but to tell you the truth with without my parents there i was pretty nervous
i guess it was because the plane was so loud and i didn't know anyone i started to think we might crash i didn't like to think about that but i couldn't help it that's when i missed my parents the most but once the plane was in the air i was pretty good
my mom gave me a coloring book of cool looking dragons to keep me busy i colored the dragon pictures all green so it didn't take very long
i only used the green crayon because it was the tallest and i wanted to keep wanted it to catch up to the red brown blue yellow purple and black ones
one thing about being being by yourself on an airplane is that the flight attendants are very nice to you
i had seven cola's and four ginger ale's which made me have to go to the bathroom eight times
i was glad that there wasn't anyone next to me the person next to me would have been very annoyed
eventually the flight attendant seemed to get a little annoyed that i had to go to the bathroom so much but it was her fault
she was the one that kept trying to give me peanuts i told her that i wanted a banana split instead but she said they don't have any banana splits on the plane but sometimes people like to eat peanuts on their banana splits i
i told her that it was the peanuts that were making me so thirsty in the first place and that if she could get me a banana split it would i wouldn't have to go the bathroom so much
she told me to be quiet and watch the movie i tried to watch the movie but i had already already seen that one so so it was boring
the flight attendant gave me a deck of cards but she wouldn't play go fish with me she said she had to help other passengers
sil
i had a game boy in my backpack my backpack was in the in the overhead thingy
i tried to push the button that lights up over my head so the flight attendant would come but guess what i was too short to reach the button so i started yelling hey peanut lady hey peanut lady
she didn't like being called peanut lady but she did get my game boy she told me to call her jennifer instead
i played my game boy until i got my new high score then jen then jennifer came up to me and said she had a surprise i thought great more peanuts but it wasn't peanuts peanuts it was something really cool
she said the captain was inviting inviting me to see the cockpit cockpit i thought i thought awesome i also bought brought my deck of cards in the case in case of the pilot was bored and wanted wanted to play go fish
jennifer took me into the cockpit and there were a million buttons and levers and knobs and stuff
at the first at first i thought wow look at all those buttons then i thought there's no way that anyone can remember to push all those buttons at the right time we are going to crash
sil
the way i figured it my game my game boy only has five buttons and i can't get past level three imagine how hard it would be to work all those millions of buttons and eat peanuts
sil
the pilot told me that it wasn't really that hard once you practiced then he told me that he once played the game i had on my game boy and he couldn't even pass one level one
i s i said if you can't even get past level one then you're a pilot and you're a pilot then i could be a pilot t too since i'm much better at pushing buttons than you are
he laughed even though i wasn't joking he s said he thought i would make a great pilot someday if i wanted to be
he was really nice but he wouldn't play go fish with me
finally we landed that that's always scary it seems like the plane is going too fast to even stop but it does
grandpa laugh laughed and took me straight to the ice cream shop i was worth the whole trip just to eat a banana split with grandpa
uhm well he like hi he went on an air uhm the kid did
sil
uhm he he went on an airplane ride to see his grandpa
and uhm he like had some encounters with the flight attendant
he c he called her peanut lady he he was glad no one was sitting next to him because he had to go to the bathroom eight times uhm he got seven colas and three
sil
uhm what did they call them soda thingys and uhm
sil
when he got he wanted banana splits from the f flight attendant and he went to see the pilot and he talked about his game boy game he played game boys

they heard footsteps in the hall and the door opened
sil
it was mister bladworth the principal miss nelson's kids were so relieved but they soon learned that mr blandsworth was not a lot of fun
sil
all morning mr blandsworth tried to amuse the class with his corny cards tricks oh brother said the class
sil
that afternoon mr blandsworth showed the class his favorite shadow pictures this is kid's stuff said the class
sil
the next day mis mister blandsworth demonstrated his favorite bird calls they were not a success
and for two days mr blandsworth showed slides of his goldfish lucy miss nelson's kids had never been so bored

while discussing erasers on the while dusting erasers on the schoolyard three of the ringleaders of two oh seven discussed the situation
something will have to be done they said we must get rid of blandsworth they had to hatch a plot
after school they painted and sewed and borrowed some old clothes
sil
and they practiced some very difficult stunt work in the back yard
sil
the next day they weren't in class that's too bad said mrs blandsworth mister blandsworth they'll miss the excitement mr blandsworth was about to show the class his collection of ball point pens from all over the world when someone came to the door

sil
oh look said the class miss nelson's back
mr blandsworth was surprised you're back sooner than we expected he said
the tall and lumpy miss nelson didn't speak er said the kids her throat must be sore are you sure you're well enough said mr blandsworth she's sure said all the kids
well in that case said the principal i'll be getting back to the office now nice to have you back miss nelson and he left the room
hot dog cried the class we get rid of blandsworth now we can do just as we please and the stroke of ten kids from two oh seven left the building no one stopped them
they went straight to the movies they saw monster ate chicago twice it's really living they said
sil
afterward they went to lucy's where they stuffed themselves silly but soon they made serious mistake
sil
heading back to school they passed miss nelson's house
miss nelsons couldn't believe her eyes those are my kids she said with a scratchy voice what are they doing out of school and who's with them
miss nelson telephoned mister blandsworth to see what was going on you're not miss nelson said blandsworth miss nelson is back
and he hung up can't fool me said miss nelson hmm said miss nelson
sil

slowly the knob turned and the door opened <unk> my name is viola swamp said the lady in a scratchy voice yipes cried the kids swamp
that's right said miss swamp and i'm here to whip this class into shape get back to those d desks on the double
the class did as they told did as they were told the big kid from three oh nine was certainly right miss swamp was a real witch
<br> she knew how to get the results the class did a whole week's worth in no time
we should have gotten rid of mrs we shouldn't have gotten rid of mrs blandsworth they said
pipe down or the swamp said the swamp or just then something under her desk attracted her attention it was a mask ah ha said miss swamp so that's your little game
you don't say said mrs swamp miss swamp probably just some of the kids acting up i'm sure it won't happen again and mrs blan blandsworth left
sil
and it would it will it said mrs swamp to the class because the swamp will be watching you

for nothing brings joy to the heart like the coming of spring
sil
she could not she could see nothing except the morning glories which covered the side of the porch
we never knew what a s such strange people existed anywhere in the world

the berenstain bears and the bad habit
sil
sister bear who lived with her mama papa and brother in the big tree house down a down a sunny dirt road in deep in bear country had been going to school for quite a while
there had been nursery school which was pure fun playing with dolls and blocks rolling clay snakes and scribbling with crayons
next had come kindergarten that was fun too there were marching games and rhythm band she also learned a lot of numbers in kindergarten and most of the alphabet
sil
now sister was in first grade regular school was different now it was still fun and she liked and she liked teacher jane very much but it wasn't all fun
there was quite a lot of work spelling number problems all kinds of things
in regular school you'd have to concentrate and sometimes when you concentrate you form little nervous habits
that's what happened to some cubs in teacher jane's class
sil
lizzy twirled her fur twirl twirl twirl freddy scratched his head scratch scratch scratch norman sucked his thumb suck suck suck
s and sister nibbled her nails nibble nibble nibble nibble
before she knew it she had nibbled them down to nubbins in fact she nibbled them down so far that some of her fingers were getting sore
oh dear said mama bear to sister when the cubs got home from school one day
you've nibbled your dals nails down to nubbins in fact you've nibbled them clean off how did how did it happen
i'm not exactly sure mama sister said but some of them are getting sore
sil
hmm said mama here's what we'll do we'll put a little medicine on the sores and bits of adhesive tape on all of them that way that will remind you not to nibble and you and will get the chance to grow them back
bits of tape helped sister remember not to nibble but they also got in the way when she tried to do cer certain things it's very hard to hold a pencil with tape all over your fingertips tune the tv or scratch when you have an itch
and when sister tried to play jacks she couldn't get any higher than two twosies
sil
but worst of all the bits of tape told the whole world that sister bear was a nail biter
sil
the next morning when sister lined up for school lizzy bruin and some others began pointing teasing sister nibbles her nails sister nibbles her nails
it didn't take sister long to decide to pull off those bits of tape
a habit mama said as she pushed the wheelbarrow along the well worn path is something you do so often you don't even have to think about it
habits are a very important part of our life and most of them are good like brushing your teeth and combing your fur when you get you get up up in the morning and looking both ways before you cross a road
but some habits aren't so good like nail biter said asked sister
would you you would like to have nice nails grow back wouldn't you said mama oh yes said sister but i keep forgetting why is it so hard to remember
sil
<br> well said mama it's sort of like this path i've wheeled this wheelbarrow so many times over that it's worn a deep rut tight down the middle
and it keeps getting deeper every time i use it
why it's so deep now i can't get out of it with a little help
i can't get out of it without a little help
that's why it is it is with a bad habit the more of you get use it the harder it get it is to get out of it
here is this is where i want to plant the bulbs what about my nail biting habit asked sister as she reached out to help get the get out of the deep rut how am i s how am i going to get out of it
all you need is a little help that's all said mama let's plant gran's tulips and while i think about it and later i'll talk to your papa he may have some ideas
i i could read her the riot act to her suggested papa you know nail biting is an outrageous disgraceful habit and if you don't stop it im immediately
dear me no said mama nail biting is the kind of nervous habit and shouting and threatening will just make her more nervous
i suppose so said papa thoughtfully perhaps some of some sort of reward would help a bit of money let's say a dime for every day she doesn't bite her nails
sil
that's right said papa until the habit's broken i'll never nibble again she said
as she thought of all the lovely dimes she was going to get but the way it turned out she didn't get a single dime all she got was discouraged all day long
sil
opps oh there it went a d a day is a long time and habits are powerful especially bad habits even with the promise of a dime sister couldn't remember not to nibble papa and mama and papa got discouraged too
oh well sighed mama life goes on i must call gran thank her for the tulip bulbs
oh you're very welcome my dear said gran when mama called and how is everything at your house is that so you know i was a nail biter when i was a cub and my mama helped me to stop
what have you tried so far mmm uh huh well i think you're on the right track with the dime but instead of giving her a dime at the instead of giving give it to her at the end of each day
sil
i mean but instead of a dime and instead of giving to her at the end of each day what and interesting idea said mama as she listened to wise old grizzly gran
so they tried gran's idea instead of a dime at the end of each day
they gave sister ten pennies one for each nail at the beginning of each day
ten pennies to keep unless she nibbled and with those pennies in her pocket jiggling when she got on the school bus jingling when she jumped in the schoolyard just waiting t to be remembered when some
when dec when some nail decided it needed nibbled the plan worked not perfectly it's hard to break a bad habit and sister had to give back some of those pennies give back some of those pennies but in ten days she had ninety three pennies
sil
but even bigger she had five finger he had she had ten fine fingernails
great for picking things up tuning the tv and scratching itches
and the next day and the next time she played jacks she got all the way she got all the way to tensies
phew phew said papa bear i'm glad that's over yes indeed agreed mama
sil
uh breathing a great sigh of relief that's when brother bear looked up looked at his fingernails and piped
up you know i think i might start biting my nails i could use the money
sil
i certainly hope you're joking roared papa because i'm not cause if you're not i'm joking i'm joking interrupted brother
sil
and he was sort of
well
sil
sister kept biting her nails so they tried something and it didn't work and then they called to thank the grandma for the
sil
the tulips and then she had an idea and it worked and she got like a dime or ten pennies everyday
sil
and the prize cup grew louder and nearer to her mental vision
sil
behind lay the ship a picture not without th its lighter side
and meanwhile by the further river bank came ro rosalind with mushrooms in her skirt
now go on and answer your note and let me finish this splendid story
more courage than my poor brother who stands there like a coward
she rushed frantically across the apartment seized her hood and ran from the cottage
they carry themselves as if they had been drilled both men and women
the red leaves were blown around in millions by the wind
sil
of course there's nothing very entertaining here for you
the youngster lingered for a moment or two watching myles at his work
these words quite destroyed the hope of late had been growing wi glowing with her
sil
its flavor when cooked is more exquisite far than mu mutton or oysters or eggs
i'm in earnest huck just as earnest as i've was ever i was in my life
sil
the day ethel brown was seven years old she had a tea party
humor and pathos make it alive and you have found your style at last
seagrave knelt by his side took his hand and burst into tears
nan said it wouldn't grow in our garden but i brought some home to try
his boots creaked too so loudly but he was still he was not at all afraid
she will be glad to see you but she has been very badly frightened <unk>
sil
he turned his back on the boy and conferred aside with lawrence
i desire it so much that i make no refusal

this little john did though with his disturbing his master of rising where he sat
the next moment he changed the subject because it seemed the best thing to do
sil
the slowest turtle
sil
every four years turtles from all over the land would crawl to the great pond
it would take some turtles from far away villages two whole weeks just to get there
where there was lots of eating and laughing turtles could catch up with their friends they had not seen since the last festival
everything about the festival was fun but the main event was the great turtle race
<unk> the winner of the great turtle race was so important that he didn't have to move for four years until the next festival
the last turtle or the less a turtle moves the bigger they got s and the longer they live
so you can see the winning g great race is a great honor
the turtle cup was a trophy that the winner could take home to their village
it had been in a sludge pond for fifty years because no one could ever beat the their turtle this was the famous turtle there was
he was the slowest turtle of all time
he hadn't m hadn't had to move for over fifty years
he was one of the biggest and most respected and also one of the trickiest turtles there was
there were s many legends about him it was it was rumored he was so slow his heart would only beat once a day
his name was mud and he was the greatest champion of his of in the history of shell dweller's festival he was unbeatable
when mud w in was in his prime there was a new turtle b born in the blue pond this turtle was named swish
when swish was born everyone thought he was w a little slow but he got a little older and the older turtles began to realize that swish was really really slow
when his mother called him in for dinner he didn't make it home until breakfast the next morning and he was only a foot away
blue pond was a nice village located about three days crawl from great pond
they they all felt a little sad because they hadn't held the turtle cup in over seven hundred years
so with swish they th they thought maybe just maybe he could bring it back to bring back the turtle cup to their little pond
everyone treated swish differently
for example mister peeks located shell cleaner would say hey the swish er hey there swish do you want a free shell waxing today
sil
you we all want you to look good when you bring home the cup mrs mrs snapper would say hi swishy do you want to come have some yummy pie to fill you up and slow you down for the big race
a fat turtle is a slow turtle
sil
mrs snapper was n never nice to anyone but she was being nice to swish
mister peeks would never do anything for free but he was going to give swish a free well s sh shells waxing
this was the kind of thing that swish would get all the time
i'll i never promised that i would win the race i can't beat mud anyway i heard once it took him three days just to yawn
so one day his parents his par told his parents i don't want to race
all the turtles in blue pond held a meeting to discuss the problem
the mayor doctor softshell said this is ridiculous swish has to race hear he is the slowest turtle i've every seen except for mud of course without him i don't have we don't have a chance
but he doesn't want to be treated special he just wants to be normal and doesn't want any anyone to hate him because he can't beat mud
you have to remember that everything he gifted is being slow he's still very young and said swish's father
we never thought of that they all said the town agreed to treat swish like a normal turtle and after a while swish decided that he would proud he would be proud to race for his village
when the time came for the festival drew near
all turtles in the land started t towards the great pond swish had to be carried on his father's back since it would have to take him months to get to great pond by himself
finally after the long journey all the turtles arrived at the great pond
this was swish's first ever shell dwellers festival and he thought that it it was the most wonderful thing he had ever seen
there were thousands of turtles different species all having a great time
look there's your cousin peek a boo from big puddle village swish's mother said
you get to meet all of sorts of new turtles
swish was suddenly very excited he told his mom you know what i'm going to win this race
i know it and these turtles will know that blue pond rules
i'm not afraid of stupid mud
swish's mom smiled and said i know you can win swish but it's an honor just to get to race said swish's mom
swish saw a rock in the middle of the field and wondered
how come they don't move that big rock out of the field it seems that everyone's in the way said swish
that's not a rock sweetie that's mom that's mud
swish made a loud gulp sound
just do your best his mom said
swishes father said son i have something to tell you as you know your great great grand turtle raced mud once
he wasn't as slow as you a as slow as you but he did teach me about mud's dirty t tricks
when he whispered in swish's ear all the tricks that the great great grand turtle taught him
after seven days of playing and dancing a bug eating finale the day of the race came
the mayor of great pond mrs tort po posted the rules on the race on a tree for everyone to see
they read rule number one the great race begins at sunrise and ends at sunset
rule number two all turtles must run as fast as they can and the turtle that is closest to the starting line wins
rule number three no turtle may pretend to go faster but go slow instead all turtles must go as fast as they can at all times
since turtles never cheat this is the most important rule to break this rule would mean to get to end the great turtle race forever
rule number four no turtle may fall asleep since you since if are asleep you aren't running as fast as you can
swish read the rules even though he knew by heart h h he knew them by heart then he heard the mayor say runner's please take your positions
the slowest turtles from each pond were carried to the starting line by members of their villages
there were about three hundred turtles racing they were all the slowest of the slow
the turtles all stretched and s thought really slow slow thoughts as they did the sky turned from black to dark blue
they look at the horizon and saw the sun was starting the rise just then the mayor said ready set slow and off they went
the turtles were very very very slow so it took them long time before they could before anyone could figure out which turtles were the slowest
after a few hours most of the turtles had gone a few feet
except for two swish and mud were both at back at the starting line
it took it looked as if neither of them had moved at all
they were both moving of course because but they were so slow that it was hard to tell
after six hours mud and swish were still tied and only moved a few inches
but by now turtles were usually way ahead of mud but this time swish was just as slow
mud knew that he would that this was being the closest race he had ever was actually getting a little bit scared
who is was this young punk he thought to himself mud and said to swish there's no way that that a turtle as young as you can be as slow
even i was faster when faster than you when i was your age you're cheating you're not going to
sil
ruin the great race forever
but swish wouldn't let mud scare him
you're just trying to make me quit
sil
i'm not going to fall for your tricks he said turtles never cheat and i'm not and i'm a turtle with honor
when mud tried another trick he started singing a soft beautiful lullaby swish started yawning
th he was tired from racing though he would nice just to listen to mud's sweet voice and fall asleep
then snapped out of it and remembered his father had warned him out of his trick
he reached i he reached in t his shell and pulled out a couple of earplugs
he put them on he put the earplugs in his ears and couldn't hear mud's singing anymore
mud kept singing his lullaby for a few hours but then he stopped right before sunset
the sun the crowd thought he must have realized his singing trick wasn't working
but then but then right at the end right before the sunset swish started to pull ahead of mud
oh no shouted the fans mud's winning looks it looks like mud is still the greatest turtle of them all
then the sunset went down
mud was the closest turtle to the starting line
swish was sad that he had lost but all the turtles from blue pond cheered for swish
they were very far proud t he gave mud such a close race swish was happy too but deep down inside he knew he was just as slow as mud
the mayor of pondland went to present the turtle cup to sludge pond again
sil
he announced well mud it looks like you've done it sludge pond wins the turtle cup again this is the time it would be a a bit next time it would be a little bit closer than you would have liked i i'll bet
what what would you like to say to all the turtles to the festival the crowd started yelling speech speech
mud didn't answer the mayor tapped mud on the sh shell and said hello hello mud
mud didn't answer in fact mud was asleep
mud was actually sung himself to sleep
ladies and gentlemen he said mud from sludge pond has been disqualified for sleeping during the race
this means we will that we have a new champion the real winner is swish softbelly of blue pond the crowd went wild
mrs tort went up to swish gave him the turtle cup she said swish you are the youngest winner of the great turtle race that was the most exciting finish i've ever had
i think that you will be a great champion for many years since turtles only get slower with age the for the first time in six hundred years i would like to present the turtle cup to blue pond
the crowd went wild again swish took the cup that day for the first time
he would take it many more times after that
it was because of swish that blue pond became the most respected pond in the land
he would never lose the turtle cup for the rest of his long life
but through though he became the greatest bi and biggest turtle of all time
much greater or bigger than mud
he was always made sure that no one treated him special that he and that he treated everyone like he wanted to be treated like a turtle with honor
sil
once there was a little t k pond named blue pond uhm and every year all the ponds would come together every four years for a festival
sil
and they would have a race after a parting for a long time and they had to run as fast as they can they couldn't do any tricks they couldn't cheat and they had to be awake the whole time from sunset to sunup
and they whoever was closest to the starting line won when the sun went down
sil
and so there was this little turtle named swish and he was really really really slow
and when he was four years old he went to the
sil
great turtle race and he faced the champion mud who had won it sixty years in a row and he lost but then at the end when mud had to make a speech he was asleep and he got disqualified for sleeping so swish won
and they took him home and he became really old and he won the race a lot of times after that
sil
i guess i'll buy a few snakes since they l look so funny coiled up
sil
see the wisdom of my choice he said holding up the large leaf of gold
but i am too old to endure your shame and my misery much longer
sil
rather would i face three strong men than i young damsel then then one young damsel
sil
i would love dearly to have these people describe their travel their travels
sil
throughout these conversations <unk> sam hodge seldom spoke
now he has gone off again for the game is getting scarce
yes my lord said the man his sunburned face reddening

sil
there has been some little mistake that could i that what could i do now to fix it

sil
in the deep gloom she could not see the anger which darkened her face
sil
she wants to give the boy an extremely bad opinion for me
i don't i know that i know the country salt law just as well as i as you do
sil
how strange that a live animal should grow on a salt like a flower
sil
rooster john
sil
their problems started when they ran out of water thankfully someone was digging a hole and found water
but soon after that they started to get flies
sil
they got tons and tons of flies
sil
of fleas
sil
then the fleas stopped but just then a man moved into the town who played a flute a flute so badly that people would run away screaming
maybe a poorly played flute doesn't sound all that bad about
sil
but just try to imagine someone scratching a chalkboard with a f with a fork fork and then multiply that times a hundred
that's how the flute sounds when the guy when this guy played it
sil
i'm serious still i'll it's not a bad
sil
it's not as bad as millions of fleas i suppose
sil
the bad the bad flute player was rooster john
<br>
he wasn't called rooster john yet he that came later
he was a new town
sil
den dentist
sil
he was a excellent dentist but his real love was music he played many music musical instruments such as guitar the tuba the piano
sil
and the clarinet
sil
however you however some for some reason the way his mouth was such
sil
was shaped made for a flute
sil
awful the uhm however for the some reasons the way his mouth was shaped
sil
shaped made his flute his flute sound awful
sil
we can't yet we can't let you play the flute anymore john said police chief s said police chief sanders
the neighbors are complaining and the cats and dogs are trying to chew off their ears
but i have to play i was born i was born to do it i don't know why
sil
but i feel like i have to or else
sil
or else bad things will happen
sil
<unk> look john you'll hear i've heard you play the clarinet you're quite good why don't you play that instead said chief sanders
sil
oh that's a nice instrument but it's just not the flute i even wrote you a song chief sanders it's called
sil
coupes and cops and robbers
then he played the song the
sil
the police chief hated the sound so much that he threw john in jail
but there can't keep john but they can't keep john in jail since he wasn't already breaking any laws so there was nothing the police could do
besides everybody loved john
since he had become the town den dentist everybody's teeth
sil
were much whiter then and cleaner then
sil
no one had any
sil
cavities and no one had any cavities
sil
so there was a problem in the little town of franksville
sil
that sound that should that they should do that
sil
what should they do they can't keep john in jail and they want to kick him out of the out of town because they all have su
sil
they can't
sil
wait they can't they couldn't keep john in jail and they don't want to kick him out of town because they all have such nice teeth
so they decide that john could play the flute and everybody else would have to wear earplugs
sil
well i'm sure you guessed that i didn't that that didn't work nobody could hear anything people were getting into car accidents and
sil
everybody looked really silly at dances dancing to music they couldn't hear
sil
wait everybody looked really silly at dances dancing to music they couldn't hear
sil
they just can't lead a normal they just can't lead a normal life
then they decide to lower him down
sil
a well and let him play down where you where no one could hear him
john thought that was an ok idea but there was no there was an echo in the well and that made the flute sound louder
<br>
windows were breaking all day and all the cows in town started to make so sour milk
sil
the local scientist doctor wong ca came up with an idea he thought that if he made a new mouthpiece
sil
especially shaped for john's mouth then perhaps he could play a flute normally
sil
and guess what it worked doctor
sil
doctor wong was the was the town hero the flute sounded normal and it turned to
sil
and it turned out john could play it it quite well
the people in the town decided to have a great big parade
sil
in franksville to celebrate the fact that for once there was no water problem no fly problem and
sil
no flute problem
then suddenly a fly landed on a little girl then a fly landed on someone else
<br>
then some landed on a bunch of people
then pretty soon ton tons of flies were landing on everyone
<unk>
before they knew it the town was filled with flies again
sil
oh no said chief sanders
<br>
just when th just when
<br>
things were going good in franksville john didn't
sil
didn't know what to do he just kept
sil
kept on playing his flute the flies were annoying so he would
sil
swat at them with his hands or
sil
and
sil
actually smashed into a in wait
sil
the flies were annoying he could not he would swat at them with his hands or or even his new flute
he started shaking the flute to get the flies off the
sil
off and accidentally smashed it into pieces but
sil
he was very upset at first then he said oh well good thing i i brought my old flute as back up
no no please don't play your old flute begged doctor wong
but it was too late john had started playing
sil
when the townsfolk heard the noise they couldn't even swat at the flies anymore
they had to cover their ears from the horrible sound the flies would land all over the people and they couldn't swat them off
it was gross then suddenly the flies fell flew away fa fast as they could
doctor wong thought for a second then
sil
then pronounced it's the flute sound the flies hate john's flute playing as much as we do john the dentist is driving the flies away
it was then that the people of franksville realized that they would have to take a good
sil
a
sil
good with the bad because so bad as the flute sounded it was a lot better than thousands of flies crawling all over them
from then on john would wake up the sun at sunrise with like a rooster and play to keep the flies away
uhm it was about rooster john and
sil
<br> how he played a hi how he played a flute and it was pretty bad
so the scientist gave him a new flute and it sounded better and he broke it by trying to shoo away some flies
and
sil
<br> uhm he broke it
sil
<br> and
sil
and so he used his old flute and uhm he scared away the flies with it so then he got up when the sun rised like a rooster <unk> and played his flute to keep all the flies away and that's how he got his name <br>
the red leaves were blown around in millions by the wind
behind lay the ship a picture not without its li lighter side
and meanwhile by the further river bank came rosalind with mushrooms in her skirt
sil
now go and answer your note and let me finish this splendid story
more courage than my brother than my poor brother who stands there like a coward
she rushed frantically across the apartment seized her hood and ran from the cottage
they carry themselves as if they had been drilled both men and women
linda not being overburdened with participation did not see this
i fear that we shall have another smart gale however it won't last long
the day ethel brown was seven years old she had a tea party
of course there's nothing very entertaining here for you
the youngster <unk> lingered for a moment or two watched myles as his work
these words quite destroyed the hope that of the late had been glowing within her
its flavors when cooked is more exquisite far than mutton <unk> or oyster or eggs
i'm in earnest huck just as earnest as ever i was in my life
humor and pathos make it alive and you have found your style at last
seagrave knelt by his side took his hand and burst into tears
nan said it wouldn't grow in our garden but i brought some home to try
his boots creaked too so loudly but still he was not at all afraid
she will be glad to see you but she has been very badly frightened
he turned his back on the boy and conferred aside with lawrence
i desire it so much that i will take no refusal
sil
and the prize cup grew larger and nearer to her mental vision
sil
the panda
why did a panda with the beautiful girl name yin yin have her name changed to the very un beautiful girl name columbus
it was fred's idea so l let's begin with fred
fred fred fred fed the panda bears the tigers and turtles the turtles weren't so bad but as for the tigers he wasn't so sure
he didn't mind handling the raw meat he had to feed
sil
to the tigers he mean his main object was to begin eaten
sil
no one could blame fred really since no one really wants to be eaten
some people do like to bite their finger nails but each afternoon at three o'clock when it was time to feed the tigers for fred when it came to pandas he had a warm spot in his heart
actually it was a eight
sil
eight eighty five point five degree spot on his left kidney but the point is that he was very fond of feeding the pandas
there were there pan there were three pandas and they were known as the pan family
they were in order of cuteness yin yin the young daughter poo poo the mother and moo man the gentle and always sleepy father
many people know that pandas eat bamboo a lot of it a lot of bamboo can get quite heavy so because of the pandas fred came very strong and was in terrific shape
but physically fitness was not the only reason that fred loved the pandas the other
sil
reas reason was that any who anyone who gets within three feet of a panda automatically falls in love with them
it's a law of nature
at further distance pandas have a strange almost magical effect on human beings which makes us want to hug and squeeze things
fred was not allowed to actually hug the panda bears since they could be dangerous so all the other people at the zoo could would know that the pandas had just been fed when they saw fred hugging
sil
rather un cuddly palm tree outside of the pandas hom home
it is interesting to point at this time that more stuffed panda bears are sold at zoo gift shops then all of the other stuff animals combined
this can almost certainly be accounted for by this strange almost magical effect that the pandas possess
but everything was not all bamboo and hugs at the zoo
one morning fred was feeding yin yin and said oh yin yin i wish that more people could come to visit the zoo
i know i shouldn't be telling you this but we might have to sell you and your family to the zoo in san angeles if we didn't don't get more money
it's not that you aren't selling enough stuffed panda bears it's just that there haven't been enough people coming to see you in the first place
i think that the zoo needs it's a great ad advertising campaign
fred was starting to feel the uncontrollable urge to hug the panda
so before he ran off to hug the palm tree quickly said it costs so much to feed you pandas i would hate if you had to leave us after all it's the only home you know
besides if you leave i'll get terribly out of shape now if you excuse me i need to squeeze something before i scream
but yin yin the young panda
sil
was not listening to fred she was talking to her best friend maggie the magpie about going to the moon yes the big one in the sky that is almost like
sil
likely not made of cheese and most certainly not made of bamboo yin yin and her best friend maggie the magpie who looked like a panda would look if pandas <unk> were birds were discussing about h going to the moon
moon
sil
her mother the f her mother and father knew that they were
sil
talking about since they hadn't thought or talked of much else since yin yin said i want to go there and pointed to the moon
enough of this nonsense nonsense said yin yin's mother poo poo what sort of nonsense is this for a young panda bear
going to the moon indeed nonsense your job is to be s
is to be cute so people want to run the gift shop and buy panda bear dolls it's industry which young lady helps pay for the bamboo that you eat
such nonsense going to the moon said her mother poo poo
but i just learned how to make myself into a ball and roll two days ago and i've becoming very good at it
i don't think it will take that long to roll there said yin yin
yin yin's father moo man <unk> didn't think it was very proper t or wise for a young panda bear to go rolling off to places where there wasn't any bamboo
but he was supportive of his young daughter and showed his support taking a n nap
sil
is a decidedly round about way to go if you must go it
sil
it it wouldn't be best to fly
nonsense said the mother i'm so mad i'm going to look at the lady over there and make her want to squeeze her son cheeks
sil
she said pit spitefully
an instant later a young boy was heard saying ouch mom cut that out
i'm sorry to say but many but many a little boy's cheeks have been made raw when mother poo poo panda was upset
sil
yin yin was always one to make good advice for his father and less than a week later yin yin and maggie had built a rocket ship out of bamboo
bamboo is very workable substance and pandas tend to handle bamboo a lot so this in itself was not that astonish astonishing at least to yin yins parents fred sure was impressed though
the main obstacle it turns out getting the rocket ship off the ground
maggie figured that if she and three of the strongest magpie friends were to each grab hold of a corner of the rocket ship <unk> they could fly to the moon so they tried one two three to the moon
they said together pulling with all their might i see your wings flapping but we don't seem to be going anywhere said yin yin
hmm heavier than i thought i think we better i think we'll need more magpies said maggie yes but how about many yes but how many more yin yin said i'm not sure exactly replied maggie
<unk> the father watched this all through one eye for he always had at least one eye asleep at all times said t'would be best to ask the owl then closed his eye
sil
so maggie flew to the owl and asked for his advice
oh wise owl i have a question that i fear only you can answer she said
sil
how to turn your head all the way around without getting a terrible pain in the neck said owl
no how many magpie's would be needed to fly a four hundred pound panda bear and a one hundred pound bamboo rocket ship to the moon said maggie
the owl instantly replied two hundred thousand and seventy six give or take two
a week later maggie managed to round up two hundred thousand and seventy s eight magpie
she could be a very persuasive little bird when she when she want when she wanted
sil
a week later despite much flapping they were still trying to get the rocket in the air it turns out that the owl didn't take the consideration that one
that once you could over one thousand magpies together they tend to fight and can't agree on a single thing
now while all this was going on what do you think s what do you supposed fred was doing
why he was feeding the pandas like he was supposed to
so one day after fred had fed the pan pandas and he was hugging the pla palm tree the zoo manager came up to him and said what is going on with y your pandas fred i've never seen anything like it
it's taken me a couple of weeks to figure it out but i think yin yin wants to go to the moon and the magpies want to take her there said fred
oh well that makes sense said the manager did you know that since the little panda built the bamboo rocket ship and those magpie's started fluttering about that the zoo's profits have gone up four four thousand percent t
that is just the type of exposure we needed those pandas will be with us for a long time
fred thought about it and said you know i think we should rename yin yin columbus
the zoo keeper said good heavens man that is a great idea no wait a second i don't understand well sir when columbus set out on his ship he was really trying to find
a quicker way to get to get around europe in order to improve trade
he wanted to be a business man but instead became a great explorer
yes but what does that have to do with pandas man
pandas man said the zoo manager well it seems to me sir that yin yin wanted to be a great explorer instead became a business woman
i see fred one more thing sir about those magpies flying above the pandas do you think that the zoo could purchase m me a large size sized umbrella
the zoo manager laughed and walked away but did purchase a fashionable yellow umbrella for fred the next day
back in the panda's home the moon panda mother panda <unk> poo poo was very proud of her daughter
after all if it weren't for yin yin they would have had to move for their wonderful home from their wonderful home
but later when fred walked into the panda's home under a his new yellow umbrella all she could think to say was nonsense
as for yin yin she was very proud to re to be renamed after a famous explorer and she and maggie never stopped trying to get to the moon
i think its pretty interesting <unk> <br> okay so there was a panda named yin yin and he has a friend that's a magpie named maggie and
sil
since the zoo wasn't very popular <br> the magpie told him about the moon and so yin yin wanted to go there and so they tried to make a rocketship and then the zoo became popular and i'm confused about the umbrella
sil
fred he likes pandas and he said when you get three feet like close
three feet apart from them you have like this urge to hug them
sil
and he has like lots of big relationship with yin yin and the magpies
sil
well they decided to change it because <br> she wanted to become a great explorer like christopher columbus
but she but then she just became a business woman so they it was kind of like the opposite so they must have thought like christopher columbus
sil
they shook the flour off her and set her down on the kitchen floor
i beg your pardon said the learned man it's an old habit with me
sil
she saw that she was on on the grass and the broken wheel beside her
sil
know then that if i tell you the reason i shall instantly die
sil
aye i know said the dame gently fearing to interrupt the story
you certainly are an able minded youngster hiram <unk> hiram he observed
sil
and still she sat and still she reeled and still she wished for wished for company
sil
they then journeyed onwards till they almost reached the mountains
sil
thy sword cannot stand against an oaken staff such as mine
sil
for you never knew exactly what this man might do or say
don't make any of your abrupt remarks or do anything odd will you
sil
nan received a sewing machine to remind her of fresh air work
he tilted his hat brim to shade his face and looked for his chickens
the poor persecuted <unk> <unk> country people believed that that the new forest was enchanted
sil
tom's costume was a splendid imitation of a cowboy
your lordship is greatly to be congratulated he said warmly
if i were as big as you are jim i'd fight these miserable turnip roots
sil
it was that day when you got your toe pounded added davie looking at joelle joel
sil
we all looked at each other trying to glean for something each from the other
sil
diana shook her head gleefully her black eyes dancing with merriment
sil
then he pulled the hood of his cloak over his ears and over his brow
which of you boys placed this stone signal asked the young ex young explorer
batman forever
sil
batman was the greatest crime fighter in gotham city
whenever criminals tried to break the law batman was there to stop them
sil
when they launch launched a crime spree batman would swoop out of the sky on his batrope or roar down the street in his batmobile
sil
just in the nick of time
sil
two face was one of the criminals batman had not yet er had not caught yet
two face and his gang committed crimes all over gotham city
sil
they worked so quickly no one could keep up with them
batman was only the was the onl wait kay batman was only one man to stop two face he would need help
sil
when he wasn't fighting crime batman had a sec bat yeah batman had a secret identity
<br> he was bruce wayne the wealthiest man in gotham city
bruce oft often helped people one day he met a young circus acrobat named dick grayson
dick was an orphan and needed a place to live
sil
bruce invited dick to stay in wayne manor
sil
dick liked living in the mansion but he wondered where bruce went every day every evening
late one night dick went searching for a clue
he discovered a secret door that led to a flight of stairs
dick followed the stairs down to the darkness
<br> he discovered an underground cavern filled with crime fighting equipment
dick couldn't believe his eyes he was inside the batcave
sil
and there was the batmobile
it could only mean one thing bruce wayne was batman
sil
meanwhile across town a gang gang of thugs had spotted a woman walking down the lonely streets of gotham city
easy money the hoods sneered as they crept up alongside her
they snatched her purse and ran
an instant later a car came screeching
sil
came to a screeching halt in front of them it was no ordinary car it was the batmobile
oh no one of the hoods screamed it's batman
sil
the hoodlums knew they were no match for batman but when the top of the batmobile opened they were surprised to see a young man
look one of the crooks shouted that ain't batman that's just a kid we can take him easy
<br> but dick quickly proved them wrong he had spent years training as an acrobat he leaped and dived dived about kicking and punching then stunned the thugs in no time he had knocked them all out
sil
you'll be okay now dick told the woman
sil
then a hand grabbed him and he was tossed into the batmobile it was batman and he was angry
sil
why can't we fight fight crime together
sil
dick asked batman wh as they drove back to wayne manor
you're too young batman answered besides batman fights alone
<br>
but batman would soon need help
in another part of a cr another p in another part of town a criminal genius called the riddler was also plotting against him
while the riddler had the brains to outwit batman he didn't have the muscle to finish him
the riddler decided that two face would make a perfect partner in crime
sil
the riddler tracked down two face and made an offer two face decided to flip a coin
if it comes head if it comes up heads we'll join forces he explained the coin hit the ground landing heads up
okay partner we have a deal two face said
sil
what's the plan
sil
tomorrow night all of gotham's richest people will be at a big party the riddler explained
you'll crash the party and rob the guests when batman arrives to stop you he'll walk right into out trap
sil
<br> the following night two face arrived at the party right on schedule
sil
all right folks this is an old fashioned stick up
sil
his gang members were so busy robbing everyone they didn't notice bruce wayne slip slip out of the room
sil
two face smiled
sil
begin phase two he whispered to his gang
they ran h then he ran out into the street and jumped into a nearby manhole batman followed him
sil
the manhole led into an abandoned subway tunnel in the dim light batman could see someone was coming toward him
it was two face carrying some kind of weapon
sil
you thought you were on my
you thought you were on my trail two face snarled
but it was a trap two face pointed his weapon at batman and fired
sil
two face's weapon sent a ball of fire hurtling toward batman
acting qui quickly batman pressed a button on his utility belt
sil
instantly his costume was covered in a fire proof coating
the ball of flame hit
sil
hit him full blast but batman was protected
sil
meanwhile the explosive fireball shattered the tunnel walls
stone and steel began to rain on batman and the ground beneath his feet collapsed batman felt him sinking
i expect you'll be buried alive two face s s two face said as batman sank deeper i'd love to stay and see you off but crime's a wastin' and i'm a very busy man
then two face walked away
sil
down down do down down batman sank
i'm finished he thought there's no way to escape
but just before batman's head disappeared below the sand
sil
a green glow had reached him had reached for him
an instant later he felt himself being yanked up
sil
up and out of the pit
sil
it was dick he had followed batman
later batman said i told you no crime fighting
aren't you glad i didn't listen dick answered
i think it's time we became partners since i just saved your life
okay batman said you've earned it but what are we going to call you
sil
dick smiled
sil
my folks used to say i flew like a bird on the flying trapeze so they called me robin
batman and robin said batman i like the sound of that
from then on batman and robin would be partners tracking down two face the riddler and every other criminal in gotham city
well it's like about batman and how robin became his crimefighter and then there was like two evil guys how tried to kill batman
sil
and robin saved his life
sil
uhm well batman finds this orphan named dick and he well dick finds out that bruce wayne is batman and uhm so
then batman is at this party and the riddler and two face come in and batman goes down in this hole and uhm robin comes and saves his life
sil
and then dick becomes robin
it was a deep dazzling lovely blue deeper than the deepest blue of the sky

yes said anne candidly i've heard that you and he were engaged once
he had gentle and refined features and his voice was soft and pleasant in tone
uh it was about a person and their trip on an airplane by themself
<br>
and how they didn't especially like the flight attendant and that they wanted a banana split and they didn't really like the peanuts
<br> but they decided in the end that they were going to be a pilot because they were good at playing game boy and using all the buttons and since there's a lot of buttons on the uhm cockpit that they would be a good pilot <br>
and in the end his grandpa took him to go get a banana split

uhm he really wanted a banana split <br>

men rejoiced <unk> openly hoping that it would spread and send them into camp
marco only stood quite still and looked at him with understanding and gravity
sil
great was the indignation of that noble bird as he watched the sense below
sil
rooster john
sil
their problems started with when they ran out of water
thankfully someone was digging a hole and found water
but soon after that they started to get flies they got tons and tons of flies
then the flies stopped but just then a man moved into town who played the flute so badly that people would run away screaming
maybe a poorly played flute doesn't sound all that bad but just try to imagine someone scratching a chalkboard with a fork and then multiply the times a hundred
that's how the flute sounded when the guy played it
i'm serious still it's not as bad as millions of flies i suppose
sil
the bad flute player was rooster john he wasn't called rooster john yet that came after
he was the new town dentist he was an excellent dentist
sil
excellent dentist he was real
but his real love was music he played many musical instruments such as the car the guitar the tuba the piano and the clarinet
however for some reason the way his mouth was shaped made his flute sound awful
sil
we can't let you play the flute anymore john said police chef sanders
the neighbors are complaining and the cats and dogs are trying to chew off their ears
but i have to play i was born to do it i don't know why but i feel like i have to or else bad things will happen
look john i've heard you play the clarinet you're quite good why don't you play that instead said jeff sanders chief sanders
sil
oh that's a nice instrument but it's just not the flute i even wrote you a song chief sanders it's called cops and robbers
then he played the song the police
sil
chef
sil
chief hated the sound so much that he threw john in jail
but they couldn't keep john in jail since he was really breaking any laws so there was nothing the police could do
besides everybody loved john since he had become the town de dentist everybody's teeth were much whiter and cleaner and no one had any cavities
sil
what should they do
sil
they could keep john in jail and they didn't want to kick him out of town because they all had such nice teeth
so they decided that john could play the flute and everybody else would have to wear earplugs
sil
well i am sure you guessed that didn't work
no one could hear anything people were getting into car accidents and everybody looked really silly at dances
dancing to music they couldn't even hear <unk> they just couldn't led a nor live lead a normal life
then they decided to lower him down a well and let him play down where no one could hear him
just though that was an ok john thought that was an ok idea but there was an echo in the well that made the flute sound louder
sil
windows were breaking and all the cows in town started to make
sil
sour milk the local scientist doctor wong
sil
came up with an idea he thought that if he made a new mouthpiece especially shaped for john's mouth then perhaps he could play the flute normally
sil
and guess what it worked doctor wong was the town hero the flute sounded normal and it turned out john could play it quite well
sil
doctor wong and john
sil
were the stars of the parade they were up on the main float big band played as they marched up and down main street everyone cheered then suddenly a fly landed on a little girl
then a fly landed on someone else then some landed on a bunch of people
then pretty soon tons of flies were landing on everyone before they knew it the town was filled with flies again
sil
oh no said
sil
john didn't know what to do so he just kept on playing his flute the flies were annoying so he would s sweet sweat at them with his hand or even his new flute
he started shaking the flute to get the flies off the off and accidentally smashed it into pieces
he was very upset at first then he said oh well good thing i brought my old flute as back up
no no please don't play your old flute doctor began begged doctor wong but it was too late john had started playing
when the townsfolks heard the noise they couldn't even swat at the flies anymore
then they had to cover their ears from the horrible sound
the flies would land all over the people and they c couldn't swipe at them them off
it was gross then suddenly the flies flew away fast as they could
doctor wong thought for a second that
sil
pronoun pronounced
sil
it's the flute sound the flies hate john's flute playing as much as we do
john the dentist is driving the flies away
as bad as the flute sounded it was a lot better than thousands of flies crawling on them
from then on john would wake up at sunrise like a rooster and play to keep the flies away
it was about
sil
this guy named john who came into the town and played a flute but it sounded really awful
sil
and the townspeople couldn't take it anymore so they tried a lot of different ideas but none of them really worked
and then this guy named doctor wong had an idea that they would make a new mouthpiece for john and it worked and his
sil
the flute began to play better well he played better with the flute and so they had a big parade for him and doctor wong but the flies came and landed on everybody
sil
and john tried to swish them away
sil
but he accidentally broke his new flute so his old flute that didn't really play good
sil
uhm he started to play that and then all the flies flew away
and then uhm
sil
every morning before sunrise john played the flute so the flies won't come back
it's about these two girls who got separated at birth basically and they both got adopted by different
well their parents
sil
sil
and the parents are looking for them so they go back home with their parents and live happily ever after except the parents die but yeah
it was a deep dazzling lovely blue deeper than the deepest blue of the sky

would i would like to start by saying i think you are very mean a very mean to me
i couldn't help it i couldn't help it anyway it was an accident and i didn't even do it on purpose
i really didn't mean to
sil
i didn't really mean to shave the cat really i swear ok here's what happened as i remember it
i saw that the cat was trying to get the gerbils and you told told us we couldn't hit the animals so i didn't know what else to do so i
grabbed dad's i grabbed dad's nose hair clippers and shaved it
you shouldn't be proud of me you shouldn't be proud of me for thinking so fast on my toes
oh sure it's easy to say that i could have just picked the cat up but sometimes we don't always think all the great under pressure you and do you and do you know what
uhm those stupid gerbils didn't even thank me they just ran on the stupid wheel and didn't and did stupid things
that that's the least that's the last time i shave the cat to protect any stupid gerbils
besides the real reason i shaved the cat was to keep it nice and cool <unk> i just didn't want to see the cat getting all hot and uncomfortable and stuff
<br> you guys will probably just say it's winter dan just it's just winter danny cats don't overheat in winter
but so what if it's winter i mean the summer is soon enough and i just wanted to <unk> the cat to get used to the idea before i got really hot
plus oscar my turtle told me to shave the cat
fine oscar can't really talk but if h if he could he would have had said
please shave the cat it's h its keeps hitting me on the shell trying to roll me over when you leave when you leave the room
you guys never liked oscar as much as the cat anyway
<br> you wouldn't always t you wouldn't alway you wouldn't always take the cat's side if you knew the stuff to do my poor hurdle to do my poor turtle
cat's aren't always nice just like my sister jenny isn't always nice but the realest reason i shaved the cat was to make a wig for those poor hairless
sil
i knew our cat would grow f her fur black back <unk> but some cats didn't have hair don't have hair they are called hairless cats
and they need fur in in the winter sometimes i think
<unk> i swear that that's the reason i also want i also was going to sell the cat
sell the c sell the cat fur and buy my sister jenny braces for her <unk> big stupid face
plus i forgot to tell you that i you should be blaming mrs cat caps casper my science teacher
she made us shave something for science ask her she said that when we shave hair it grows back back harder and sometimes even darker
so i thought that if i could shave the cat a bunch of times her hair would grow black her hair will gr grow back harder each time and soon she would h have an invincible coat of cat fur armor
<unk> then she would be a super cat
sil
and you could take her on tv shows and let get lots of money
so that so that you can see jenny to go to college and it's it's a dumb little tattle'tale
she's good at school and you bought her a cat because she's so responsible and stuff
just cause she's a good student doesn't mean that she really she's really responsible last night i saw that she didn't brush her teeth <unk>
oh yeah i forgot to tell you that
dear mom and dad jenny didn't brush her teeth last night
i think that she should brush her teeth twice tonight
that's just my opinion though i i'll bet you didn't even
i bet i'll bet you didn't know something else you know that i wanted to be a barber
i was afraid to tell you the real reason i shaved the cat
that was why that w that was what that was that i wanted to be a barber and i needed practice
i was afraid you wouldn't let me practice my own on my own head can i
can i practice shaving jenny's head i promise that i'll do a better job then i did on the cat cause now i have dad dad now i have what dad calls life experience
not that i shaved the cat though not that i shaved the cat though
<unk> actually the truth is that but by accidentally by accident turned the nose hair clippers
and the cat was being ch the cat was being chased by the turtle and ran right by the cripples and it sha cl clippers and it shaved shaved itself
if i had the c if i had a if i had a cat <unk> i would teach it not to shave itself that's for sure
i don't have to get a good i don't have to get good grades to know that you should teach a cat how to shave itself
plus if you weren't always cuddling with my sister so much as so much maybe you would have been with her cat instead instead the cat came into my room because jenny never plays with it
sil
enough never plays with it enough the cat liked being shaved anyway so i didn't see the big deal
i didn't so i don't see the big deal
i didn't it i don't i think it really i think it really liked its haircut only the reason it hasn't come out for two weeks is because you guys made such a big deal about it poor kitty
and this and this and poor kitty that if it's your fault really dad please don't read the next part
dear mom don't let dear mom don't let dad know the real reason i shaved the cat <unk>
i shaved the cat was he always sneezing a sneezing around it
i know how much you hate him always sneezing and stuff so i
sil
so i thought if i got rid of its fur he wouldn't sneeze
and then you would have a better marriage
so it really it's really my f it really father's day gift it's really my father's day gift to him i couldn't buy him anything nice since you took away my allowance for when i shaved the neighbor's dog
<br> how come jenny gets a cat and i get a stupid turtle anyway
turtles don't do anything except their stick their poked stick their heads out of stick their heads out and not be not and be not cuddly
can i get a dog please
so conclusion i'm getting hungry and i'm sorry for shaving the cat although you can see it's really jenny's fault for not being as responsible as you always say sh and not you always say always say and not brushing her teeth
p s if you would have bought her a turtle i couldn't have shaved it
sincerely danny
so uhm a kid named danny shaved the cat
and then he keeps lying about it like
at first he said like uhm
sil
uhm uh like d
sil
he said uh he's like always saying it's not his fault
and then he said he wanted to be a barber
and he keeps making up new and excuses
and uhm and he's in his room because he shaved the cat
and he thinks the cat likes his haircut and he just d and he thinks that the cat's
sil
uhm hiding because h it they treat him that he says that they treat him bad
but i think it was really because he shaved it
and then uhm
sil
and he uh this was like a big letter that he had to write he had to write like a big letter so he can get out of his room
sil
and uhm
sil
so he got in trouble for shaving the cat

dear mom and dad parents
since you have grounded me and told me to write down why i am sorry before i was allowed out of my room i am mad at you
i would like to start by saying that i think that you are very mean to m make me do this because it wasn't even my fault
i couldn't help it anyway
it was an accident and i didn't even do it on purpose
i really didn't mean to shave the cat really i swear
ok here's what happened as i remember it
i saw that the cat was trying to get the gerbils and you told us we couldn't hit animals so i didn't know what else to do
so i grabbed dad's nose hair clippers and shaved it
you should be proud of me for thinking so fast on my toes
oh sure it's easy to say that i should have picked just picked up the cat
but sometimes we don't always think all that great under pressure
and you know what those stupid gerbils didn't even thank me
they just ran on that stupid wheel and didn't and did stupid things that's the last time i shave the cat to protect any stupid gerbils
besides the real reason i shaved the cat was to keep it nice and cool
i i just didn't want to see the cat getting all hot and uncomfortable and stuff
<br> you guys will just probably say it's dinner danny cats it's winter danny cats don't overheat in winter
but so what if it's winter i mean it'll be summer soon enough and i just wanted that cat to get used to the idea before it got really hot
plus oscar my turtle told me to shave the cat
fine oscar can't really talk but if he could he would have said please shave the cat
it keeps hitting me on the shell and trying to roll me over and when you leave the room you
sil
and when you leave the room
you guys never liked oscar as much as the cat anyway
you wouldn't always take the cat's side if you knew that if you knew the stuff he hid did to my poor turtle cat's aren't always nice just like my sister jenny isn't always nice
but the realest reason i i shaved the cat was to make a wig for those poor hair less cats that we saw on tv on the animal channel
i knew our cat would grow her fur back but some cats don't have hair
they are called hairless cats and they need fur in the winter sometimes i think
i swear that's the reason also i was going to sell the cat fur and buy my sister jenny braces for her big stupid face
plus i forgot to tell you that you should be blaming mrs casper my science teacher she made us shave something for science ask her
she said that when we shave hair it grows back harder and sometimes even darker
so i thought that if i could shave the cat a lot of a lot of bunch of times her hair would grow back harder each time and soon she would have an in invincible coat of cat fur armor
then she would be a super cat and you could take her on tv shows and get lots of money so that you can send jenny to college even if she is a dumb little tattle'tale
she's no good at school and you bought her a cat cause she's so responsible and stuff
sil
just cause she's a good student doesn't mean she's really responsible
last night i saw that she didn't brush her teeth oh yeah i forgot to tell you that
dear mom and dad jenny didn't brush her teeth last night
i think that she should brush her teeth twice tonight that's just my opinion though
i'll bet you didn't know something else did you know that i wanted to be a barber
i was afraid to tell you the real reason i shaved the cat was that i want to be a barber and i needed practice
i was afraid you wouldn't let me practice on my own head can i practice by shaving jenny's head
i promise that i'll do a better job then i did on the cat cause now i have what dad calls life experience
not that i shaved the cat though
actually the t truth is that i by accident turned on the nose hair clippers and the cat was being chased by the turtle
ran right by the clippers and shaved herself i kept saying no kitty no don't shave yourself
but my stupid sister never taught her cat how to listen so she just ignored me
see she's s not so responsible after all
if i had a cat i would teach it to not shave itself that's for sure
i didn't have to get good grades to know that you shouldn't teach a cat to shave itself
<br> plus if you weren't always cuddling with my sister so much maybe she would have been with her cat
instead the cat came into my room because jenny never plays with it enough
the cat liked being shaved anyway so i don't see the big deal
i think it really likes liked it its haircut the only reason it hasn't come out for two weeks is because you guys made such a big deal about it poor kitty this and poor kitty that it's your fault really
dad please don't read the next part
dear mom don't let dad know that the real sh reason i shaved the cat was that he's always sneezing around
i know how much you hate him always sneezing and stuff so i thought if i get got rid of his fur he wouldn't sneeze and that you would have a better marriage
so it really so it was really my father's day gift to him i couldn't buy him anything nice since you took away my allowance for when i shaved the neighbor's dog
<unk> how come jenny gets a cat and i get a stupid turtle anyway turtles don't do anything except poke their heads out and be not cuddly
can i get a dog please so in conclusion i'm getting hungry and i'm sorry for shaving the cat although you can see that it's really jenny's fault for not being as responsible as you always say and not brushing her teeth
p s if you would have bought her a turtle i couldn't h have shaved it sincerely danny
he shaved his cat or his sister's cat because uhm
<br>
he didn't really
sil
like it that much and also i he thought it would like it being shaved uhm
but he's just trying to make up excuses because he doesn't want to get in trouble with his parents
sil
and he's just trying to get his sister in trouble and cause uhm her his parents think he's she's all responsible
and he wants to be the responsible one for once
sil
so
sil
and thinks he did the right thing but his parents don't think that <br>
sil
he wanted to be a barber
sil
and he thought the cat uhm needed like a coat like cause it was summer so er it it was winter but he thought that he needed to have a coat for the summer so he shaved it
and uhm because in science class they shaved something and his teacher

told him that it was okay i guess and yeah
